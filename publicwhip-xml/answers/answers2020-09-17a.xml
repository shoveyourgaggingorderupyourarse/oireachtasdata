These BCPs will be among the first premises connected under the National Broadband Plan and many of them have the potential to provide remote working facilities.</p>  <p>  My Department has also funded a number of hubs under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme in the last two years and will continue to explore the options for investment which will support remote working. </p></reply>

These sites have been identified by Local Authority Broadband Officers and have proceeded with the permission of the site owners and the committees and volunteers that run them.</p><p>The location of the BCPs are available on the website of National Broadband Ireland, <i>www.nbi.ie</i>, although it should be noted that sites can be subject to change due to circumstances such as the provision of a commercial high speed broadband connection to an area.  </p><p>To date National Broadband Ireland (NBI), the company contracted to deliver the National Broadband Plan, has provided initial wireless high-speed broadband connections to 130 sites. </p><p>Vodafone Ireland, which was awarded the contract to provide and manage end-user services at these sites, has commenced the installation of its equipment at BCP sites and the first cohort of sites will become fully operational in the coming weeks. </p><p>By the end of 2020, approximately 200 BCP sites will be live, with the remaining 100 sites operational in early 2021. </p></reply>

All funding decisions regarding projects are entirely a matter for the Local Action Groups (LAGs), which administer the programme in each LEADER sub-regional area. In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. Interested applicants should, in the first instance, contact the relevant LAG through its Implementing Partners to discuss the funding and criteria that may be available. The list of Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on the National Rural Network website at the following link: <i>www.nationalruralnetwork.ie/leader/local-action-groups/</i>.</p><p><b>-  The 2020 Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) with funding of &euro;2m, launched in </b>June<b>.</b>The CEP provides capital grants towards enhancing the facilities available to communities.

Repurposing of existing buildings in town or village centres to facilitate remote working and/or other community use, and that deliver a benefit to the community as a whole, are included among the activities that are eligible for funding. The closing date for the Standard Town and Village Renewal Scheme is 30<sup>th</sup>September 2020 with communities being encouraged to submit their applications through their Local Authority by that date. </p></reply>

My Department is providing additional vital supports to rural and community organisations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is supporting the following initiatives:</p><p>On 16 March 2020, my Department launched the COVID-19 Government Action Plan in partnership with other Departments, State agencies and our extensive network of community and voluntary organisations. These initiatives provide support for volunteering, funding to ALONE for their crisis telephone support line, and an email helpdesk facility to assist smaller community groups with their queries. </p><p>On 9 April 2020, an initial &euro;2.5 million COVID-19 Emergency Fund was introduced to provide immediate and urgently needed funding to community and voluntary groups that are participating in the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Community Call&rdquo; initiative which is being led by the Local Authorities. </p><p>On 11 May 2020, a &euro;40 million support package for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Charities and Social Enterprises was launched by Government and is administered by the Department. This funding is being made available through the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is specifically set aside to support initiatives which will benefit the most disadvantaged groups in society. </p><p><b>The package included:</b></p><p>A &euro;35 million COVID-19 Stability Fund which will provide a level of support to qualifying organisations who are most in need and have seen their trading and/or fundraising income drop significantly during the crisis; and</p><p>A &euro;5 million Government commitment to a Philanthropy Fund, (Innovate Together) which will focus on supporting responses to the COVID-19 crisis that require innovative and adaptive solutions to existing and emerging challenges.</p><p>To date, funding of over &euro;25 million has been allocated to more than 480 organisations under the COVID 19 stability Fund. This funding is supporting the delivery of critical services in every part of the country.</p><p>This funding is provided in addition to the more than &euro;45 million in funding, announced last November, for the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2020. That funding was allocated for 43 separate measures to be delivered across nine Government Departments to benefit disadvantaged groups.</p><p>The funding package for these organisations is complementary to the range of other supports provided by the Government to support businesses, employers and employees on foot of the crisis.</p><p>As a result of COVID-19 my Department also developed a &euro;1.2m Support Fund to assist Community Service Programme, or CSP, supported organisations. </p><p>In June 2020, the Department launched the 2020 Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) with funding of &euro;2m. The CEP provides capital grants towards enhancing the facilities available to communities. The CEP is administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area.</p><p>In August 2020, with funding from the July stimulus package, the Department launched a &euro;5m fund under the CEP for community centres and community buildings. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s other investment programmes, such as the 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme, CL&Aacute;R programme, Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme and Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, which support large and small scale capital development in rural areas, continue to be rolled out and all place a particular emphasis on supporting a post-COVID recovery.</p><p>In respect of the Department&rsquo;s other programmes, funding commitments are being maintained, and though delays may be experienced in delivery for a period of time it is expected that all projects and initiatives will continue when safe to do so.</p><p>My Department also funds the COVID-19 Community Outreach (CCO) programme. Coordinated by  the Wheel and Irish Rural Link the programme links and supports the work of thousands of community groups across Ireland who are responding to meet the needs of communities during the COVID-19 crisis. </p></reply>

All funding decisions regarding projects are entirely a matter for the Local Action Groups (LAGs), which administer the programme in each LEADER sub-regional area. In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. Interested applicants should, in the first instance, contact the relevant LAG through its Implementing Partners to discuss the funding and criteria that may be available. The list of Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on the National Rural Network website at the following link: </p><p><b>-  The 2020 Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) with funding of &euro;2m, launched in </b>June<b>.</b>The CEP provides capital grants towards enhancing the facilities available to communities. The CEP is administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area. </p><p><b>-  The July stimulus package, of &euro;5m, </b>launched by the Department in August 2020, provides  funding under the Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) for community centres and community buildings. </p><p><b>-  The CL&Aacute;R programme</b>provides funding for small scale projects in designated rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population. Under the 2020 programme a &ldquo;Schools/Community Safety Measure&rdquo; is being funded. This may fund the provision of safety related infrastructure in the environs of a school or community space such as lighting, car park and footpath upgrades and digital speed safety signs.  </p><p><b>-  The CL&Aacute;R programme 2020, launched at the end of May </b>(closed for applications under these measures at the end of August last). The applications received are now being assessed and it is hoped to announce successful projects by November next.</p><p>-  <b>The 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme</b>has been tailored to focus on interventions that can support the economic and social recovery of our rural towns and villages, and assist them in responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. Car parking improvements expressly designed to encourage increased footfall in town centres and that deliver a benefit to the community as a whole are included among the activities that are eligible for funding. The July Stimulus Package provided an additional &euro;10 million of funding that allowed for the expansion of the Scheme and brought the total funding available for the Scheme this year to &euro;25 million. This funding will provide funding for more projects in rural towns and villages to respond to the challenges presented by COVID-19. A total of &euro;6.1m has been approved for 226 projects to date in 2020 with additional successful projects due to be announced in due course. </p><p>-  The closing date for the Standard Town and Village Renewal Scheme is 30<sup>th</sup>September 2020 with communities being encouraged to submit their applications through their Local Authority by that date.</p></reply>

There are now almost 3,200 people employed across 21 IDA client companies in the County. I am determined, together with IDA Ireland, to increase these numbers further as best we can.  </p><p>The table below details the number of IDA site visits to County Wexford from 2016 to the first quarter of 2020. I have been informed by the IDA that site visit data for Q2 will be released at the end of this month.</p><p>The reduced number of site visits in 2020, as the Deputy will appreciate, is mainly attributable to the introduction of international travel restrictions related to Covid-19. Those restrictions have, amongst other things, led to the cancellation or postponement of scheduled IDA site visits and client meetings in every region of the country, including Wexford and the South-East. As an alternative to site visits, the IDA has migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities to digital platforms. The Agency has developed new digital content and has also put in place an E-Site Visit experience for potential investors.</p><p>Notwithstanding the difficulties presented by the pandemic, site visits do remain an important means by which the IDA can showcase regional locations &ndash; including Wexford &ndash; to prospective investors. At the same time, we must recognise that the final decision as to where to invest rests solely with the company concerned. It is also the case that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential or job creation, as a significant proportion of all new FDI comes from existing IDA clients already present in the country. </p><p>Looking to the future, IDA Ireland will continue to draw the attention of multinationals looking to invest or expand in County Wexford. The IDA continues to engage with key stakeholders on the ground in Wexford including local authorities, the education sector, Enterprise Ireland, Wexford's Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and both overseas and indigenous companies with a view to generating new employment opportunities. Regional development, including for the South-East, will also be at the heart of the forthcoming new IDA strategy. I look forward to working closely with the IDA on the formulation of this new strategy that will guide the Agency's work in the time ahead. <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017  </th>       <th>2018  </th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>Q1 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. </p><p>Under the NBP deployment plan premises will be passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years. Nursing homes, within the intervention area, will be among the many premises which will benefit from the roll out of the National Broadband Plan which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the nearly 540,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.</p><p>Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 20 counties and steady progress is being made with over 91,000 premises surveyed to date. This survey work is feeding into detailed designs for each deployment area and laying fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year. </p><p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible.</p><p>  The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working.</p><p>The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

The targets are to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 year. These targets are expected to achieve the Climate Action Plan target of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from the residential sector.  </p><p>A cross-Departmental Retrofit Taskforce has been established to develop a new retrofit delivery plan capable of achieving these targets. The plan being formulated aims to address barriers to energy efficiency investments across all sections of our housing stock.  The recent announcement of an additional &euro;100 million for retrofit as part of the July Stimulus package will result in the biggest ever budget for retrofit in 2021.  </p><p>The Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households who meet the defined eligibility criteria and who are vulnerable to energy poverty. The Scheme has been in existence since 2002 and has provided upgrades to over 142,000 homes, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The aim of the scheme is to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding, focusing eligibility to those in receipt of certain payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p><p>Eligibility for Fuel Allowance is a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (<i>www.deasp.ie</i>). At present a Person Supported by the Service (PSS) is not entitled to Fuel Allowance, which is one of the criteria for eligibility for the Warmer Homes scheme. However, the Climate Action Plan includes a commitment to review ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need, including eligibility criteria. Recommendations in relation to the implementation of changes to the scheme will be finalised shortly.  </p><p>The Deputy may also note that the properties referred to in his question may be eligible to receive support for upgrade works under the Better Energy Communities Scheme which is another scheme administered by SEAI.  The Scheme funds community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area &ndash; homes, including those at risk of energy poverty, community facilities and businesses. These partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers. The Scheme will reopen for applications in the coming weeks.  Further information on the Communities Scheme is available on <i>www.seai.ie</i>.</p><p>Eligibility for capital allowances and VAT rules more generally are matters for the Department of Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners (<i>www.revenue.ie</i>).</p></reply>

AGS and my officials are currently in the process of determining the data that is required, and ensuring all the relevant legal and data protection provisions are in place. To facilitate improved road traffic enforcement, AGS has requested key additional driver and vehicle data elements that are not currently available via existing data-sharing arrangements.  </p>  <p>  Some elements of driver data being proposed, including the driver records referenced here, will be made available. In addition, where no drivers licence is produced at the roadside, it is proposed that AGS will have the ability to search the driver record with additional search criteria such as name, address, date of birth etc </p>  <p>  While rollout of the handheld devices is ultimately a matter for the Garda Commissioner, my Department recognise the significant role it will have in the enforcement of driver and vehicle regulation, and are very supportive of the initiative. </p></reply>

I have met with the daa and have been updated on the challenges facing daa Group, including Cork Airport.  Minister of State Naughton has also recently met with the Managing Director of Cork Airport. </p>  <p>  In order to assist businesses in facing the challenges of Covid-19 and further protect employment, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for companies of all sizes, including those in the aviation sector, which includes the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) (and its predecessor the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme), commercial rates waiver and deferred tax liabilities. daa is availing of these supports which are designed to assist businesses, including our airports in terms of the management of their companies during this unprecedented time. </p>  <p>  The Aviation Recovery Taskforce set out recommendations for consideration by Ministers and Government on what needs to be done to assist the Irish aviation sector to recover from the COVID-19 crisis. The taskforce report contains a number of recommendations on how to support Irish aviation, which has been badly affected by the almost complete shutdown of international air travel. The recommendations include measures to sustain the industry for so long as travel restrictions are in place and also measures to help stimulate a return to growth, when the time is right. The Government has already implemented several recommendations, including the publication of safe air travel protocols. We have progressed a European slot rule waiver for airlines in consultation with the European Commission.  The wage subsidy scheme was extended to April 2021.  </p>  <p>  The other recommendations, including further targeted financial supports to help reinstate connectivity (including for Cork Airport), regional development and sustainability in the Sector are being examined.  Work is required to develop these recommendations into effective interventions, and that work is underway by my Department.  It will feed into the Government&rsquo;s further plans to aid broader economic recovery, including in the aviation sector. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s recently published Resilience and  Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19 specifically addresses the approach to international travel and proposes that Ireland will broadly support the European Commission&rsquo;s recently published proposal to promote a common approach to travel restrictions and movement within the EU/EEA.  This proposal will now be considered by the Council of Ministers. </p>  <p>  I want to assure you Deputy that my Department is in continuous contact with the daa, in terms of both Dublin and Cork airports and it is my intention that Cork Airport will be well positioned operationally to contribute to the economic recovery. </p></reply>

As a result, while there will be some availability for urgent tests, the RSA's capacity to make these available in all cases will be limited. The RSA therefore, have deemed it necessary to prioritise frontline healthcare workers for the limited number of urgent test slots available. This approach for prioritising customers will be kept under review as the RSA moves through the service resumption.</p>  <p>  My Department is remaining in close contact with the RSA, which is exploring how further to manage backlogs while prioritizing public health, and this process is being informed by lessons learned as centres operate under the new health restrictions.   </p></reply>

In this context the 2020 Programme for Government has commited to review and reduce speed limits, where appropriate, to address both road safety issues and carbon emissions, and ensure greater compliance.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s road network is extensive and inconsistent, which means that a &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; solution for Speed Limits for the 100,000 kilometer road network is not always possible and queries will arise.  My Department is currently developing a speed limit appeals process whereby a member of the public can query or appeal a speed limit to the local authority.  </p></reply>

No. 119 of 1994), made under the 1993 Act powers, specifies that a driver of a vehicle accessing a motorway must hold a licence, i.e. a full driving licence and not a learner permit.  Failure to comply with regulations made under section 43 is an offence, and an offender is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;2,000. </p>  <p>  The reason why we prohibit learners from driving on motorways is a judgement that motorways are not an appropriate environment for such inexperienced and unqualified drivers.  It is therefore safer for them and for other road users for them not to have access to motorways.  I am aware that a different view is taken in some other jurisdictions, but this is a judgement call and I have no plans to change the Irish law in this respect.  </p></reply>

For example, it includes employees that were not previously eligible for the TWSS, such as seasonal workers and new hires, and applications for such workers under the EWSS may be backdated to 1 July 2020.</p>  <p>  Many of the strictest public health restrictions on the economy have been eased and it is expected that businesses are able to shoulder more of the economic burden of their businesses, so it is appropriate that the level of State subsidy be moderated.  At the same time, it is recognised that economic outputs are unlikely to return to normal for many businesses for much of the rest of 2020, which is why the Government remains committed to supporting employers by means of a wage subsidy.   </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as of 15 September 2020, there were 33,348 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, proportionately more than half of all those who availed of the TWSS over the whole duration of that scheme. As a result, there are no plans at present to re-visit the core eligibility criteria for the EWSS.  However, I can confirm to the Deputies that the operation of the EWSS and its effectiveness will be kept under close review over the coming months. In fact, the relevant legislation obliges me to monitor and superintend the administration of the scheme and empowers me to make certain adjustments across the whole scheme where I determine that these are necessary. </p>  <p>  For those businesses who need further support, there are a number of options open to them &ndash; including State backed loans which may be repaid using EWSS funds as well as grants.  Particular attention is drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan - including  the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme. </p></reply>

Revenue have estimated that 360,000 workers were supported by the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) when it concluded at the end of August, so this expected level of coverage of EWSS is considered to be a reasonable assumption.  </p><p>However, the cost of the EWSS will depend on the overall uptake of the scheme which will become fully apparent after the first claims have been processed in October 2020.  I am advised by Revenue that, as of 15 September 2020, there were 33,348 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation being proportionately more than half of all those who availed of the TWSS over the duration of that scheme.</p><p>It is emphasised that these cost projections are subject to review and for every additional 50,000 qualifying employments over the duration of the scheme, the cost is estimated to increase by &euro;0.25 billion.  </p><p>As the scheme is demand led I have been clear that a significant increase in the number of claims may require a policy review and re-evaluation of the terms of the scheme. </p><p>This is why the enacting legislation (Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020) provides that adjustments may be made to certain elements of the scheme. Following monitoring and regular assessments of the EWSS, such adjustments may be made by the Minister for Finance via secondary legislation, having consulted with my colleagues the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The specific elements (set out in subsection 21 of the Act) are:</p><p>- the end date of the measure;</p><p>- the rate of subsidy and applicable income threshold per employee; and</p><p>- the turnover test to determine qualifying employers.</p></reply>

Where the employer made an additional payment to an employee, this &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; amount was required to be reported as gross pay. Therefore, for most TWSS employees their gross pay as reported to Revenue for the duration of the scheme reflected their &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; payment only (over 80% received &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; payments) and not their actual weekly pay, inclusive of the TWSS.</p>  <p>  Revenue has analysed the numbers of TWSS recipients where the sum of gross weekly pay (&euro;0.01 or the &lsquo;top- up&rsquo; amount) plus the net subsidy amount was less than &euro;151.50. This analysis suggests there may be around 20,000 such employees, with approximately 5,000 of these having exited the TWSS by the end of the scheme.  However, given the issues noted above, this should be considered highly provisional and be very likely subject to revision.</p></reply>

It was appropriate and equitable therefore that payments made under the TWSS should be subject to income tax and USC.  A zero rate applied for the purposes of employee PRSI contributions.  </p>  <p>  Tax was not collected in real-time through the PAYE system while the schemes were in operation.  Instead, liability to tax will be calculated by Revenue through the regular end of year review process.  </p>  <p>  This decision was taken in order to maximise the amount of financial support that was provided to recipients at a time when it was considered that they needed such support most, when the TWSS was first announced and expected to only be in place for 12 weeks.  </p>  <p>  When the TWSS was extended for a further 10 weeks until the end of August 2020, Revenue took steps to minimise the amount of income tax and USC due, if any, on TWSS payments at the end of the year.  This was done by placing all recipients of the TWSS or the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) on the &lsquo;week 1 basis&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax or USC liabilities that arise at year end. </p>  <p>  In cases where the tax liability for those payments exceeds unused personal and PAYE tax credits for 2020, the level of income tax and USC due may be reduced if the person has additional tax credits, for example health expenses, to offset.   </p>  <p>  Revenue has also assured me that if any income tax and USC liabilities still arise following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with its customers to collect the outstanding liabilities over an extended period of time.  Revenue will be adopting a fair and flexible approach to collecting tax due on payments made under the TWSS or the PUP.  This will be achieved by reducing their tax credits for subsequent tax years, thereby minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible.     </p>  <p>  I am advised that the final calculation of the end of year liability for each person is dependent on a range of factors, including a person&rsquo;s civil status, his or her available tax credits, the amount received under TWSS and/or PUP, any top-up payments made by the employer, as well as other entitlements and credits, such as health expenses.  As there are considerable differences in each person&rsquo;s tax circumstances, it is not possible to provide details of the estimated undercharges arising from the taxation of payments under the TWSS, nor to estimate the numbers of individuals who may have such undercharges.  These details will not be available with any degree of accuracy until after the year end.</p></reply>

It is available online at: <i></i>.</p><p>While the question of the publication of the review of flat rate expenses is a matter for Revenue to decide upon, given that the deliberations on the policy matters set out in the TSG continue, it would not be unexpected that further action in that regard might await the outcome of those deliberations.  Similarly, the question the timing of the introduction of any changes to the FRE regime is solely a matter for Revenue.</p></reply>

Allocations were announced in January, May and November of last year with a total of over &euro;56 million awarded to 1,648 different projects. All unsuccessful applicants were given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision. In relation to the capital grants announced in November, a total of 122 appeals were submitted by the December deadline.  The review of these appeals was completed in April with 6 new allocations approved. The priority to date this year has been to advance all of these projects to ensure the facilities are available for use and that the relevant grants are drawn down.  </p>  <p>  In relation to future grants, following the finalisation of the appeals process, a full Review of the 2018 round of the SCP was undertaken. This Review has now been complete and the terms and conditions of the next round of the programme will be based on the recommendations in the Review. Work on these terms and conditions is now being finalised and a new round of the programme will be open for applications before the end of the year with an announcement in this regard expected in the coming weeks.   </p></reply>

The rationale for the exclusion of certain categories of ratepayers is that their operations were not as severely impacted by the pandemic, coupled with the need to direct resources appropriately. To support both the local government sector and the ratepayers impacted, &euro;600m has been allocated by Government to fund the cost of a waiver of commercial rates for six months for eligible businesses, which will take the form of a credit in lieu of rates.</p>  <p>  This allocation will cover the expected loss in rates income, as estimated by local authorities, for the period of the waiver. Local authorities will receive an initial proportional share of the available funding in the coming weeks. The remaining allocation shall be assigned based upon certified financial returns for each local authority detailing the total amount of credit in lieu of commercial rates applied to ratepayer accounts, during the period 27 March to 27 September 2020. </p></reply>

The 2019 demand was in respect of sites on the registers in 2018.</p><p>The below table sets out the information available in relation to the specific request: <table>    <tr>       <th>Planning Authority</th>       <th>3% Levy Liability 2019</th>       <th>&euro;  payments collected 2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork   County* </td>       <td>380,910.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork   City</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun   Laoghaire-Rathdown</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>14,611.95</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City </td>       <td>2,935,650.00</td>       <td>640,950.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>14,400.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway   City</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway   County</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>151,800.00</td>       <td>72,900.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>2,250.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin </td>       <td>132,600.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>255,365.58</td>       <td>3,645.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>12,000.00</td>       <td>0.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>300,000.00</td>       <td>165,000.00</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>4,199,587.53</td>       <td>882,495.00</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* Following the issuing of demands, 5 sites with a levy liability of &euro;87,960 were transferred from Cork County Council to Cork City Council as part of the Boundary re-alignment. </p><p>All levies due on an individual site will remain a charge on the land concerned until all outstanding levies due are paid.

In 2017 my Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs. This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for additional resources.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer complete an application process annually to apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for an assessment or diagnosis from external professionals.</p>  <p>  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department delivers a tiered, consultative model of service. Schools are supported to put in place a continuum of support which encompasses, universal best practices for all, early and targeted intervention for some pupils at risk and more intensive and individualised supports for pupils with more complex and enduring needs. NEPS supports schools at a system level in relation to best practices at each level and provides an individual casework response for those with the greatest needs. In this model the school takes responsibility for initial identification, assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with emerging difficulties including those with developmental delay. Where, following initial school based intervention, difficulties persist or a pupil is not making the expected progress, they may request the involvement of a NEPS psychologist to assist with further assessment and intervention planning and monitoring for the pupil. This system allows psychologists to build capacity at school community level while giving early attention to the most complex cases. This model aims to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</p>  <p>  From the outset of this pandemic my Department has been proactive in supporting schools through the development of advice and guidance to support the wellbeing of school communities.   On the ground at local level NEPS has continued to remotely deliver  a psychological service to schools which has included to the extent possible continuance of support and advice in relation to concerns regarding individual pupils.  As schools reopen  NEPS psychologists will continue to work directly with schools at local level to identify and respond to priority needs including individual casework.  In Phase 1 (first half term) of the return to school NEPS is providing a service to all schools with a focus on wellbeing. NEPS psychologists are connecting with each school, listening to their needs and engaging in initial planning with schools on how best to respond. It is important that children and young people are supported to experience a successful transition back to school, recognising that transition is a process over time rather than a once-off event. In order to support needs an additional 17 NEPS psychologists are being appointed and will be deployed nationally. </p></reply>

This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.  </p><p>The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  This standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.The standardisation process applied across all subject and levels.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p><p>The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.</p><p>In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics (e.g. school type, student gender, etc.) either at the level of the student or the school.The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools  his means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.</p><p>While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school has been adjusted downwards. </p><p>The standardisation model has been subject to a high degree of human oversight by the National Standardisation Group with a number of safeguards built in to ensure fair results for students.</p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the results and are available here: .</p></reply>

While the estimated marks have been subject to a process of adjustment to ensure fairness and comparability across schools, the national standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p><p>Following the standardisation process, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7<sup></sup>September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades.  </p><p>The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced changes to the marks leading to a change in the grade that would have been awarded based on the school estimates in one or more of their subjects.  </p><p>In terms of the grades awarded, there has been no change of grade in 79.2% of cases, with 83.1% of all grades either the same or higher than the school estimates while 16.9% of grades are lower.

As the loss of learning through school closures will</p>  <p>  have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments have been arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders. Additionally, briefs for coursework for subjects, including practical subjects, will be issued at least a month earlier in the school year to provide certainty for students.</p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</p></reply>

This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.  </p><p>The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  This standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.The standardisation process applied across all subject and levels.  The adjustments that occurred through standardisation resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree o over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p><p>The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.</p><p>In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics (e.g. school type, student gender, etc.) either at the level of the student or the school.The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools  his means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.</p><p>While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school has been adjusted downwards. </p><p>The standardisation model has been subject to a high degree of human oversight by the National Standardisation Group with a number of safeguards built in to ensure fair results for students.</p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the results and are available here: <i></i>.</p></reply>

The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. </p>  <p>Updated health advice was received from NPHET on the 18th August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings. </p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans, to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing. The timeframe for implementation</p>  <p>  will vary from route to route. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is conducting a full assessment to see where re-organisation or re-scheduling of services is possible. In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann has recently invited applications from operators who wish to be considered for the provision of additional post-primary services that may be required. </p>  <p>  As of the 11th September 2020 there were 2206 mainstream Post Primary routes in operation. 20% of these routes are operating at 50% capacity while in the region of 52% of SEN post-primary services are operating at 50% capacity with planning being undertaken by Bus &Eacute;ireann to implement the remaining routes on a rolling basis.  This process will take into account procurement guidelines and compliance with driver vetting and safety procedures consistent with the operation of school transport services.  </p></reply>

A number of Departments including my own Department were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department held a series of meetings with CE  supervisor union representatives to consider a range of proposals, mindful of the wider environment and the financial implications of any  such proposals.    Discussions were also undertaken with my Department officials and their counterparts in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). These discussions are ongoing. </p></reply>

The projected expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2020 is approximately &euro;919 million.  Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion.   </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means tested payment made to people whose income falls below certain limits, and who are looking after certain people in need of full-time care and attention. </p>  <p>  The system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.  </p>  <p>  Current disregards for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple, making the means test for carers the least onerous within the social protection system.  </p>  <p>  A couple earning a joint annual income of up to &euro;37,500 (net of PRSI and other allowable deductions) can qualify for maximum payment and, given the tapered withdrawal approach, retain a payment of just under half-rate while earning &euro;49,750.  A single person may retain a full-rate payment while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, and retain a payment of just under half-rate while having an annual income of &euro;25,400.</p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence based perspective.  Some 92% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard.  Carers who would benefit from an increased disregard would be in higher income households. </p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the key role that family carers play in our society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review; however, any changes to scheme criteria would have implications for overall spending and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  </p></reply>

There is no provision in the adoption acts for a further extension. Before a new Declaration can be issued, there must be a new assessment of the prospective adoptive parents.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there are a number of families who have received Declarations of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt, and for whom, unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the adoption process. This is particularly the case where people are seeking to adopt from abroad, and where travel restrictions are imposed by other countries.</p>  <p>  I am aware that considerable efforts are being made to arrange travel for these families, and this situation is actively being kept under review, with close engagement between my officials and the Adoption Authority of Ireland. </p>  <p>  On the issue of expiry of Declarations of Eligibility and Suitability, it is my intention to contact Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland, and request them to closely monitor cases where a Declaration is close to expiry, and the prospective adoptive parents are due to travel. I will also request Tusla and the Adoption Authority to expedite the process of re-assessment and issuing of a new declaration, within the provisions of the legislation.  Finally, I would advise prospective adoptive parents to remain in contact with the Adoption Authority and Tusla in relation to Declarations which are close to expiry and the potential need for re-assessment.  </p></reply>

The programme currently provides 15 hours of free early learning and care per week. </p><p>There are sixteen payable weeks in the period between September and December.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-17a.381.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091700078#WRH00400"><p>I welcome the recent publication of Cyber Safe Ireland&rsquo;s fifth annual report, which provides up to date and informative data on online trends and usage among children. The report acknowledges the opportunities provided by digital technology but also highlights some of the risks and vulnerabilities faced by children and young people. It suggests that risks can be minimised by equipping children with the skills and knowledge they need to safely and smartly navigate the online world and by service providers putting proper safeguards in place to protect users. As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I am very aware of the risks and opportunities that the online world brings, and I am committed to working with my colleagues in a co-ordinated Government response to address issues arising.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to the enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the establishment of an Online Safety Commissioner.  The general scheme of the OSMR Bill 2019, which has the aim of regulating harmful content and creating a safer environment online, was published by the then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in January 2020. The Bill sets a clear expectation for online platforms to take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the users of their service, including children. </p>  <p>  The Bill provides for the appointment of an Online Safety Commissioner as part of a wider Media Commission to oversee the new regulatory framework for online safety. Online safety codes will deal with a wide range of issues, including measures to be taken by online services to tackle the availability of harmful online content, for example cyberbullying material and material promoting eating disorders, on their services. The Online Safety Commissioner will also have a role in promoting positive digital citizenship among children and young people, in conjunction with Webwise and other educational partners, schools, as well as the Ombudsman for Children. The Commissioner will also develop a research programme led by internationally recognised experts to review the existing and developing literature in relation to the consequences, benefits and potential harms to society and especially children, of digital activity. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-19, which was launched by the then Taoiseach in July 2018, recognises that online safety is not the responsibility of any one Department and sets out the rage of actions and activities underway across six key Government Departments (Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health and Business, Enterprise and Innovation) to keep children and adults safe online. </p>  <p>  Children First operates on the premise that it is the responsibility of everyone in society to keep children and young people safe from harm. This responsibility includes keeping children safe from harm online. As part of the Action Plan, in January 2019 my Department published an addendum to the Children First Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the preparation of risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements. In addition, Tusla has revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet.</p>  <p>  As part of the government response to Covid-19, in April, my Department launched a range of supports for parents and children to support them during this challenging time. This included a new online gov.ie resource for parents, entitled &lsquo;Parents Centre&rsquo;, which brings together high quality information and online resources for parents into one portal. Parents Centre provides links to a wide variety of material including around learning, parenting and supports that are available. It includes a link to the Webwise, an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills, which is the key internet safety online access point for parents in Ireland.  As a response to Covid-19, the Webwise Parents Hub has been updated with online safety advice for parents, including around screen time as well as with the publication of &lsquo;A Parent&rsquo;s Guide for a Better Internet&rsquo;, covering topics including managing technology use at home, social networking tips and dealing with cyberbullying.</p>  <p>My Department also provides funding to three national youth organisations which provide online safety resources for the youth sector. The National Youth Council of Ireland provides the Web Safety in Youth Work Resource, SpunOut has developed an Online Safety Hub which provides guidelines for young people on online safety and Youth Work Ireland, in conjunction with McAfee Security, has developed a digital safety programme which highlights the risks associated with online activity.  </p></reply>

Over &euro;3m is currently available for this support. </p>  <p>  In addition to the above grants, ETBs have access to the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) aimed specifically at Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) learners with disabilities. Supports from this fund are distributed to PLC colleges based on the number of learners with disabilities and their individual needs. The supports provided by this Fund in the FET sector has risen by 16% over the last five years to &euro;2.7m.</p>  <p>  The FET sector, through the implementation of the new FET strategy, is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, with the aim of enabling every citizen to participate fully in society.</p></reply>

The recommendations outlined in the submission along with other relevant submissions received in advance of budget 2021 are being considered as part of the overall budgetary discussions on higher education provision for 2021. </p>  <p>  To date significant progress has been made in increasing investment in Higher Education and putting in place a sustainable funding model for Higher Education.  We currently invest &euro;1.87 billion, before the Covid response funding, in our third level sector.  Following the announcements in Budget 2020 Higher Education spending has increased in the order of &euro;450 million compared to 2015.</p>  <p>  I am focused on mitigating against the impacts of COVID 19 on vulnerable students. Covid-19 has disrupted many aspects of our lives. For students in third level, it has resulted in a changed college experience.   The resumption of the academic year is our most pressing challenge and ensuring our students and staff are safe is my number one priority. </p>  <p>  A substantial funding package of &euro;168m was announced on 22 July for publically funded further and higher education providers under the remit of my Department and for students to mitigate against the impacts of Covid.  </p>  <p>  As part of the package of Covid supports for the higher and further education sector I have allocated &euro;15 million of capital funding for a once-off Covid 19 Grant to support disadvantaged students in accessing ICT devices.  This grant is being made available to further and higher education institutions.  The institutions are using the grant funding to purchase devices to support disadvantaged students who are encountering challenges in accessing devices for online and blended learning.  The distribution of the devices, and the associated terms and conditions, will be a matter for each individual further or higher education provider. </p>  <p>  The package of Covid 19 supports also includes a further &euro;10m in access supports for students. Most of this money will be used to top up the Student Assistance Fund, with remaining funding used to support students via the access services in the higher education institutions. </p>  <p>  The provision of additional financial support will assist the safe commencement of the 2020/21 academic year and in order that the sector can contribute fully to economic recovery and to meeting priority skill needs and provide assurance and confidence to students and their families as well as to staff and other key stakeholder regarding the capacity and capability of the sector in meeting critical teaching and learning and research objectives.</p>  <p>  The future funding needs of the sector are currently under further review through the Departments engagement with the European Commission/DG Reform. The review is a comprehensive economic evaluation of the various funding options presented in the Cassells Expert Group Report and is being undertaken by an expert independent international consortium of consultants including Indecon and LE Europe.</p>  <p>  Since taking up office in this Department and through the ongoing budgetary process, I am engaging closely and considering proposals from a wide range of stakeholders including USI.  I will continue to work towards increased investment in Higher Education and supports for students for 2021 and beyond.</p></reply>

This includes deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions.  As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. </p><p>I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.  I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p><p>To date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the new Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, prioritises the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland through the four year implementation plan A Policing Service for the Future.  In its report, published in September 2018, the Commission outlined a vision and roadmap for strengthening An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the broader national framework for policing, security and community safety.  The report followed extensive consultations with communities and a wide range of stakeholders over fifteen months. </p><p>A key commitment in A Policing Service for the Future is the rollout of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s new Operating Model.  The Garda Operating Model reorganises resources around the delivery of frontline policing, placing an increased emphasis on engaging with communities and supporting victims of crime.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in each Division, there will be a dedicated Superintendent leading a community engagement team. I am confident that this reorganisation will further strengthen community policing and engagement, and provide a more localised, responsive policing service for each Division nationwide.</p><p>In a broader sense, the Deputy might also wish to note that implementation of A Policing Service for the Future will see the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 repealed and replaced by a Policing and Community Safety Act.  My Department is progressing work on the preparation of a Policing and Community Safety Bill as a matter of priority. </p><p>In addition to setting out a new governance and oversight framework for policing, it will redefine the functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable, place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the broader issue of community safety and refine local structures supporting local accountability for policing.  In that context, my Department is currently in the process of finalising the most appropriate model to achieve this. All existing structures and approaches to community safety have been considered as part of this work and in line with the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing that community policing and community engagement should be at the heart of new structures and policing arrangements.</p></reply>

However, some general information is provided below, which may be of assistance. </p><p>If the parent concerned has received either a declaration of refugee status under the Geneva Convention; programme refugee status; or is a beneficiary of subsidiary protection status in Ireland they may be eligible to apply for their child to join them here by making a Family Reunification application under the provisions of the International Protection Act 2015. Applications must be made within 12 months of receiving one of the above declarations in writing to:</p><p>Family Reunification Section</p><p>Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service,</p><p>13-14 Burgh Quay,</p><p>Dublin 2.</p><p>If the parent concerned is not eligible for Family Reunification under the International Protection Act 2015, they can apply for a &ldquo;Join Family&rdquo; long stay visa if the child wishes to remain in the State for more than 90 days. Comprehensive guidelines for all types of visa applications are published on the website of the Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).  The guidance for a visa for the purpose of joining family members residing in Ireland refers applicants to the Policy Document on Non-EEA Family Reunification.  The criteria set out in that policy is used in assessing both visa applicants for this type of visa and any subsequent residence application should the person's visa application be successful.  </p><p>Section 18.7 of the Policy Document outlines the rationale for the approach adopted and the reasons why persons coming on a visitor visa are not permitted, once here, to overstay or turn a short stay into more permanent residency. Applications for long-stay visas for the purpose of joining with family require more detailed consideration than those of short stay visits as there is a requirement for the applicant to show that they can be supported without undue reliance on the State.  For this reason, such applications made after the person has arrived in the State having obtained a visa for a different purpose, i.e., a short visit, is not permitted.  </p><p>The Policy Document on Non EEA Family Reunification, is available at: <i></i>. </p></reply>

While there is no specific legislative provision regarding parental alienation in Irish family law, section 246 of the Children Act 2001 provides for an offence of frightening, bullying or threatening a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or wellbeing. There is also a range of legislative provisions in place for dealing with child welfare particularly regarding the relationship between a child and his/her parents or guardians, providing the framework for a legal response to a wide spectrum of child welfare issues. </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on Reform of the Family Law System, which was published late last year, considered the issue of parental alienation among a broad range of issues in the area of family law.  A Family Justice Oversight Group has recently been established within my Department which, in addition to departmental officials, also includes representation from the judiciary, the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Consideration of the recommendations contained in the committee&rsquo;s report will be integrated into the work of that group.</p></reply>

While every effort is made to process such applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result of these factors. </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the way the Immigration Service Delivery function (ISD) of my Department conducts its business. In line with Government and public health advice, ISD has implemented a suite of measures to help in reducing the spread of the virus. These measures included the closure of our offices in Burgh Quay and the implementation of remote working for Immigration Services staff in order to comply with social and physical distancing measures. Unfortunately, these measures have led to a reduction in processing capacity. While delays are expected including in the processing of family re-unification visa applications, ISD is endeavouring to keep operating to the best of its ability.</p><p>I am advised that the time taken to decide &quot;join family&quot; visa applications, from family members who are in Category A in the Dublin Visa Office, where all necessary information is available to the Visa Officer, is currently around 6 months.  The time taken for &quot;join family&quot; visa applications from family members who are in Category B, is approximately 12 months. The processing times for visa decisions are published on the visa pages of each Visa Office and Embassy website.</p></reply>

Roll-out of these Units will meet a key commitment in A Policing Service for our Future, the four-year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Garda authorities have informed me that the Wexford DPSU will be launched on 24 September 2020. To date a total of 21 DPSUs have been established to date across 20 Divisions, including two established in the DMR West Division.</p>  <p>  More broadly, I can assure the Deputy that addressing domestic abuse remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the justice sector as a whole at this time. In recognition of the added risk of domestic abuse during the pandemic, my Department has led development of an inter-agency plan to address domestic abuse in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.  This includes the provision of additional funding to frontline services, to ensure that supports and services remain available to victims and other measures to ensure that the civil and criminal justice system can continue to give priority to domestic abuse.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to give priority to those who are at risk of domestic abuse, through a targeted operation &ldquo;Operation Faoisimh&rdquo; and a public awareness campaign has also been launched, in partnership with the community and voluntary sector, to publicise the support which is still available. The campaign website www.stillhere.ie includes up to date information on domestic abuse and sexual violence, as well as information on the services and supports which are available to victims.</p></reply>

The Policy Document sets out the criteria to be considered where such applications are made. Section 18.3 of the document, which is cited in the Deputy&rsquo;s question, makes it clear that each case must be considered on its particular merits.</p>  <p>  The Policy must be read as a whole. For example, section 18.8 of the Policy says that it is not intended to allow elderly dependent relatives, other than parents, come to the State for family reunification purposes except in very rare circumstances.  Furthermore, section 14.1 of the Policy defines &lsquo;dependency&rsquo; by reference to the financial and social support the sponsor is already providing and the degree of dependency involved.  These criteria are carefully examined before a decision is made. </p>  <p>  Should a permission be granted, it would initially be a temporary permission lasting for 12 months but allowing for renewal, subject to the criteria outlined in Policy Document continuing to be met. </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, and the National Action Plan.  </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual. </p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.</p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.</p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.   In that context, I can assure the Deputy that any restrictions currently in place have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review.</p></reply>

However, I note that the health centre in question is a private practice and as such is free to recruit additional staff in accordance with its needs.</p></reply>

This includes a specific commitment to supporting &ldquo;the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, including the development of a Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, to tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland.&rsquo; The Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce was established in September 2019 with the aim of improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare. A number of initial priority areas for action have been determined by the Taskforce, with the issue of endometriosis recognised and included as part of a priority workstream on improving gynaecological health for women and girls. These workstreams are currently developing proposals to improve women and girls' health and further updates will be made available on the official Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce webpage: <i></i>.</p><p>Work related to this area is ongoing within HSE. The HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.  As such, the Programme has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis. The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory, or see and treat, model, rather than the traditional outpatient referral model.  An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources.  It is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments. The roll out of Phase One of the new Model of Care has commenced, with the first three clinics to be established under the governance of the Rotunda Hospital, Cork University Maternity Hospital, and University Hospital Galway, with a more limited clinic in Waterford.  Ultimately a maximum of 13 clinics will be established on a phased basis over the coming 3 to 4 years.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, and the National Action Plan.  </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual. </p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The effect of this latest important step is that all Irish towns with populations in excess of 10,000  are now LSZs within which the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of certain fuels is prohibited. This will have a positive impact in terms of reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in the areas selected, with consequent public health benefits for residents of these new zones.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is also taking the first step in preparing new solid fuels regulations. This includes the development of a public consultation document which recognises the need for a more comprehensive approach to the regulation of solid fuel, with a view to ensuring a transition to lower polluting fuels for residential heating. My Department will provide input to the consultation as appropriate.</p></reply>

It provides supports which assist older people to live independently in their own homes for longer and enables large numbers of people to return home following acute hospital admission who otherwise would remain in hospital or would be admitted to long stay residential care.</p><p>The HSE has advised that the spread of COVID-19 throughout our communities has posed significant challenges for many areas of our Older Person&rsquo;s Services, including Home Support Services. As a result of the impact of COVID-19 and the national effort across all Community Healthcare Organisations throughout the country, some aspects of normal monthly reporting have been delayed with data coverage issues in some areas<b></b>therefore available data is preliminary and may be subject to change.  Preliminary data currently available reflects the period to the end of July 2020. As of this date:</p><p>- over 9.8 million home support hours were delivered nationally to 51,571 people</p><p>- Almost 165,000 home support hours have been delivered to 148 people through intensive home care packages.</p><p>- there were 4,550 people waiting for funding for new or additional home support </p><p>Winter 20/21 is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of COVID-19 and the uncertainty around the level of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 health care demands.</p><p>The HSE is finalising a Plan, in line with Sl&aacute;intecare principles, for winter planning within the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The initiatives in the Plan are aimed at increasing hospital and community capacity, reducing unnecessary hospital admissions by enhancing alternative community care pathways, and enabling timely discharges from acute hospitals, and consequently reduce waiting times in hospital emergency departments. There will be a focus on targeted actions to shift care to home and ambulatory care environments, especially for high-risk cohorts such as elderly patients and those with chronic illnesses. </p><p>The resources for the Plan will be sought as part of the 2021 estimates process. In advance of this, Government has allocated &euro;600m to support the early roll-out of the Winter specific measures in this Plan. This will facilitate the commencement of priority measures from an operational perspective.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p><p>Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. </p><p>There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme at this time. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, will be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.  </p><p>In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs. </p><p>Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;124 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines. </p><p>Persons who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependents may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. </p><p>The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses. </p><p>In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. </p><p>Further information on the medical card scheme and the application process are available at <i>www.hse.ie</i>. </p><p>Patients may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. Details on how to claim are at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The Government approved the drafting of the Bill in October 2019. The Bill will introduce a licensing system for the sale of tobacco and nicotine inhaling products, prohibit the sale of tobacco products at events and locations primarily intended for children and prohibit the sale of nicotine inhaling products to children.</p>  <p>  The promotion of tobacco free environments through the use of voluntary measures or by the introduction of bye-laws is a key component of Tobacco Free Ireland - Ireland&rsquo;s national tobacco control policy. Initiatives creating tobacco free environments in healthcare settings, sporting facilities, playgrounds, educational campuses and in towns and cities have been successfully developed through consultation with stakeholders including local authorities, educational bodies, the HSE and the Department of Health. </p>  <p>  The responsibility for enforcement of current tobacco control law rests with the Environmental Health Service of the HSE therefore it is likely that any measure to ban smoking in outdoor areas would be enforced by that body.</p></reply>

This is most regrettable as many of the affected growers were facing very strong market demand for their produce after a number of challenging years. </p>  <p>  The Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Horticulture Sector is a mechanism that can assist growers to help businesses rebuild and address the challenge of climate adaptation. My Department is prioritising payment of grant aid to approved applicants under the 2019 Scheme and it is expected that the full budget of &euro;6 million will be drawn down by the end of 2020.  </p>  <p>  This Scheme is due to re-open towards the end of October 2020 and grant aids capital investments in specialised plant and equipment as well as emerging technologies specific to commercial horticulture production. Under this scheme, aid at a rate of 40% (or a maximum rate of 50% in the case of young farmers) is payable on the accepted cost of approved capital investments or equipment. This Scheme is 100% funded by the Irish Government. </p>  <p>  In addition, growers and food businesses can also benefit from access to the Government&rsquo;s liquidity and investment responses to Covid-19 impacts, including the expansion of the Future Growth Loan Scheme for capital investment and Microfinance Ireland loans for working capital.   While the banks have extended their payment break from three months to six months for those directly impacted by Covid-19, the Government has announced an expanded Credit Guarantee Schemes, which will support working capital lending to SMEs, including farmers. </p>  <p>  Finally, food businesses are eligible for the Covid Working Capital Loan Scheme, as well as Enterprise Ireland supports to maintain business continuity and liquidity. Bord Bia has provided an additional &euro;1m Covid-19 response Marketing Package for Agri businesses to accelerate eCommerce and expand marketing activities.</p></reply>

The Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) also operates independently of my Department. </p>  <p>  The staff allocation for the Agriculture Appeals Office is a Director, 11 Appeals Officers and 10.5 administrative support staff.  The staff undertake duties in relation to both Agriculture Appeals and Forestry Appeals. All Appeals Officers are members of the FAC. </p>  <p>  The FAC is chaired by an independent chairperson, Mr. Des Johnson formerly of An Bord Pleanala. The quorum for the committee is three. Two Appeals Officer who have been assigned full time to the FAC and all other appeals officers are assigned on a rotating basis whilst also carrying out their Agriculture Appeals Officer functions. </p>  <p>  The work of the FAC continues on a daily basis in relation to the processing of appeals, circulation of information and publishing the outcome of appeals on the website. In 2018 and 2019, the FAC held 47 and 45 hearings respectively.  To date in 2020, the FAC have held 182 hearings (since 30th March 2020, these meetings have been held remotely).</p>  <p>  Since the FAC was established, the number of appeals has increased significantly: the number of forestry licence appeals received in 2019 was 489 in respect of 311 licences which was more than double the combined total of appeals received in 2017 and 2018 (231 in respect of 169 licences). To date in 2020, there have been 689 forestry appeals received against 444 licences. </p>  <p>  We have also proposed new legislation amending the Agriculture Appeals Act which is designed to align forestry licensing appeals process with best practice in other appeals processes.  For instance, it includes proposals for the appointment of Deputy Chairpersons and the creation of sub-divisions of the main Committee which will increase capacity to hold hearings.   Certain other efficiencies in the operation of the committee are also proposed. </p>  <p>  My Department has received almost 9,000 submissions in response to the publication of the draft Bill.  The level of engagement with this legislation is very welcome.  Early analysis by officials of my Department shows a significant majority of submissions received support the introduction of the Bill and the proposals therein.  The careful examination of submissions is continuing ahead of publishing them on my Department's website.  The submissions will inform the updated version of the Bill, which I will present to the House in the next fortnight subject to all procedures being complete. </p>  <p>  Additional resources have previously been assigned to the FAC, including additional administrative resources and personnel with planning expertise, to assist with administering appeals.  These will be added to shortly to ensure their readiness for the implementation of the Bill, subject to its passing in the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, I understand the implementation of Mackinnon is also a priority and I expect to be making further announcements on this issue very soon.</p></reply>

It is prosecuted by two fleets, the main fleet which operates across the Celtic Sea (primarily ICES division 7g) and the sentinel fleet comprising of vessels that are under 17 metres in length overall that operate in the Dunmore box (inshore waters in Dunmore East area). </p>  <p>  In Ireland, fish quotas are a public resource owned by the State and are made available to fishing vessels based on an overall policy framework which has been developed over the past 30 years. The result of this long standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet involves a balanced spread of sizes and types of fishing vessels who have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities and have delivered economic activity including vital employment in these communities, where there are very limited alternative economic activities.  </p>  <p>  The key commercial whitefish quotas (cod, haddock, monk, hake etc) are managed on a monthly basis with maximum catch limits set for vessels.  Pelagic stocks such as mackerel and herring are managed on an annual or seasonal basis with catch limits set based on allocation regimes developed over many years and primarily related to historical catch records.   The Irish fish quota management system is designed to ensure, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions, a fair and rational allocation of quotas between fishing vessel operators and management to support fishing seasons and the availability of by-catch quotas during the year. The management arrangements have been set and developed over many years since the commencement of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the introduction of quotas.   Any amendments or changes to the policy on management arrangements are determined by the Minister of the time following detailed analysis and full consultation with stakeholders.   </p>  <p>  Within the policy, allocations and other arrangements are decided by the Minister on an ongoing basis having regard for the advice of the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) and, for the Celtic Sea herring fishery, the Celtic Sea Herring Management Advisory Committee (CSHMAC) which was set up in 2005 to provide advice to the Minister in relation to the management of the Celtic Sea Herring Stock and fishery within the policy framework set by the Minister.  The Committee is comprised of representatives from the four Fish Producer Organisations, the Fish Co-Ops and Processors and, since 2016, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF).  The Committee meets at relevant intervals during the year to discuss issues of concern to the fishery such as scientific advice regarding the state of the stock and also proposals in relation to future management arrangements within the Minister's policy. </p>  <p>  The Celtic Sea Herring stock is at one of its lowest stock levels since 1958 and the ICES advice for 2020 was for zero catch. In 2019, the European Commission submitted a special request to ICES to &ldquo;provide advice on the minimum level of catches (tonnage) required in a sentinel fishery, which would provide sufficient data for ICES in order to continue providing scientific advice on the state of this stock&rdquo;. The EU Council adopted a Total Allowable Catch for the stock in line with ICES advice which gives Ireland 750 tonnes quota for 2020 specifically to allow a fisheries-based data collection for this stock. </p>  <p>  The management arrangements for the 2020 Celtic Sea Herring fishery have not yet been finalised. In setting down the management arrangements for this fishery, I have regard for the recommendations of the CSHMAC, subject to the proper management and rational exploitation of the fishery.</p>  <p>  The Marine Institute has been consulted to provide scientific advice to ensure that the data requirements for ICES, in order to continue providing scientific advice on the state of this stock, will be satisfied. Prior to finalising the management arrangements for this fishery, the recommendation received by my Department from the CSHMAC will be reviewed by me in tandem with the scientific advice provided by the Marine Institute to ensure that the sampling requirements of the Marine Institute will be met. </p></reply>

The Government is committed to reform of the planning and appeals processes as set out in the Programme for Government and we have presented draft legislation to this effect which I expect to be presenting to the House in due course. </p>  <p>  My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues. The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable. </p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required.</p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, is overseeing and monitoring delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project. This plan is already yielding progress with felling licences issued in August the highest in the previous 13 months in both volume and area.</p>  <p>  In tandem with this plan a draft amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 is being introduced which aims to increase efficiencies in the appeals process. I very much welcome the almost 9,000 submissions on the Bill which we are now reviewing in advance of presenting the Bill to the House for consideration in the very near future.</p>  <p>  While it is the objective of my Department to issue tree felling licences within four months from the date advertised, now most applications are not issued within this timeframe.  Applications for forestry licences cannot be issued within the first 30 days to allow for public consultation.  Furthermore, once a decision is issued, the licensee must wait 28 days before commencing any forestry operations to allow for appeals.  It is the aim of my Department to return to issuing most tree felling licences, within given objectives, through the procedures set out in the project plan as set out above.</p>  <p>  I know that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p></reply>

To that end, the agreement does ensure that there will be equivalent standards in relation to agricultural production in Mercosur. EU Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Standards in relation to animal and plant health will not be relaxed in any way - they remain non-negotiable - and the highest EU standards will be applied to all imported goods, especially food. </p>  <p>  The agreement also includes a detailed chapter on Sustainability and recognises the need to address the urgent threat of climate change and the role trade has in this regard. It also underscores the importance of both Parties implementing the provisions of the Paris Agreement and promotes the positive contribution of trade to a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions.  It is fundamental that these provisions are adhered to by the Mercosur countries for the agreement to progress any further. </p>  <p>  The European Commission engaged the London School of Economics to carry out a &ldquo;Sustainability Impact Assessment&rdquo; on the agreement, the draft final report of which was published on 8th July 2020. This EU study is being augmented at national level by a whole-of-Government review announced by former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar T.D. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in collaboration with my Department, commissioned the Implement Consulting Group to carry out this Economic and Sustainability Impact Assessment (ESIA) for Ireland. This report is due presently. </p>  <p>  The final outcome of both studies, among other factors, will inform Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the discussions in the coming months, and to the ratification process.</p></reply>

I welcome the work of the Stakeholder Group which consists of a broad range of members and reflects the diversity within the sector. </p>  <p>  The tillage sector in Ireland is an important component of the Agri-food industry making a significant contribution of an estimated &euro;500m (2019 farm gate prices) to overall agriculture output. The sector is a critical source of high quality grain to the animal feeding industry and straw for feeding and bedding and use in the mushroom industry. </p>  <p>  Cereal growers also make a significant contribution to the food and drinks sector in the form of malting barley and oats for the breakfast cereals industry. This is a significant area of economic return, not just for the tillage sector itself but also for the wider rural economy. In addition there is also a small but important seed industry servicing the sector with potential for expansion in some crops. </p>  <p>  Both I and my Department consult on an ongoing basis with tillage Stakeholders including on the content of this report. The report will also feed into the ongoing deliberations of both the CAP consultative process and the development of the Agri-Food Strategy to 2030. Working together, I am confident that the future viability of the tillage sector will be secured both in terms of economic and environmental sustainability.</p></reply>

According to CSO data, the average farm size has remained relatively stable over the past decade or more with the average farm size of 32.7 hectares in 2010, 32.5 hectares in 2013 and 32.4 hectares in 2016. Over the same period, the number of farm holdings has also remained relatively stable with 139,860 farms recorded by the CSO in 2010, 139,600 in 2013 and 137,500 in 2016. In the 2016 FSS, the CSO indicated that of the 137,500 farms in Ireland, 137,100 (99.7%) were classified as family farms and that almost 43% of farms in Ireland were less than 20 hectares in size.</p>  <p>  Water quality in Ireland is generally considered in good health. However, the latest Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Water Quality in Ireland Report has identified a further decline in some catchments. Ireland has a regulatory framework for the protection of water by nutrient losses through the Nitrates Directive and the Nitrates Action Programme. Ireland's current Nitrates Action Programme concludes in 2021 and the process of reviewing the Nitrates regulations and derogation will commence soon and will be subject to consultation with all stakeholders. There is a commitment, and most importantly, a plan in place to reduce losses of nutrients from agricultural sources. </p>  <p>  I would accept that there is a significant climate challenge facing society globally, and agriculture must do its share to respond to this challenge. The Programme for Government commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade) and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Every sector is expected to contribute to meeting this target by implementing policy changes, and the special economic and social role of agriculture and the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane, as described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, will be fully recognised in plans to achieve these targets. The agri-food sector has a strong foundation on which it can build to develop new practices, technologies and strategies to reduce its emissions. Many of these will also have co-benefits in terms of improving the productivity and efficiency of agri-food businesses, and indeed in terms of other environmental co-benefits. Taking a system wide approach can thus improve their environmental, economic and social sustainability</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the enormity of this challenge for the sector and for this reason, I believe that the successor strategy to Food Wise 2025 can play an important role in providing a framework for helping to realise this ambition. The Stakeholder Committee established to develop the new Strategy to 2030 are currently carrying out their deliberations. Their terms of reference are to outline the vision and key objectives, with associated actions, required to ensure the economic, environmental and social sustainability of the agri-food sector in the decade ahead. I have already met with the Committee itself and I am satisfied that their work will make a very important contribution to ensuring the sustainability and viability of the agri-food sector. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has committed to publishing the new strategy within six months of Government formation. It also stated that the strategy should provide an ambitious blueprint for the industry for the years ahead, adding value sustainably in the agri-food sector into the future, and supporting family farms and employment in rural Ireland. There is also a commitment to ensure that, in addition to growing international markets and value-added export as a key priority, a strategic focus of the strategy will be on environmental protection, reversing biodiversity decline and developing additional market opportunities for primary producers, closer to home.</p></reply>

My Department delivers a coherent package of supports to strengthen and rejuvenate rural and urban communities. These supports enable economic growth and development and also support communities to address gaps in meeting social needs, including those caused by higher levels of deprivation.  The Department delivers funding support for rejuvenation of areas across the following three programmes: </p><p><b>Rural Development Investment Programme-&euro;149.7m. </b>These programmes include; Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), LEADER Programme, Town and Village Renewal Scheme, Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure scheme (ORIS), Local Improvement Scheme (LIS) and the CL&Aacute;R Programme</p><p><b>Community Funding Programmes-&euro;153.9m. </b>These programmes include; Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), Community Services Programme (CSP), Community Enhancement Programme (CEP), PEACE IV, Public library funding, Dormant Accounts Funding<b>. </b>This funding also supports communities faced with difficulties due to marginalization and isolation.</p><p><b>The 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme</b>has been tailored to focus on interventions that can support the economic and social recovery of our rural towns and villages, to generate improved economic activity and assist them in responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. Car parking improvements expressly designed to encourage increased footfall in town centres and that deliver a benefit to the community as a whole are included among the activities that are eligible for funding. </p><p><b>The July Stimulus Package </b>provided an additional &euro;10 million of funding that allowed for the expansion of the Scheme and brought the total funding available for the Scheme this year to &euro;25 million. This funding will provide funding for more projects in rural towns and villages to respond to the challenges presented by COVID-19. A total of &euro;6.1m has been approved for 226 projects to date in 2020 with additional successful projects due to be announced in due course. The closing date for the Standard Town and Village Renewal Scheme is 30<sup>th</sup>September 2020 with communities being encouraged to submit their applications through their Local Authority by that date.</p><p><b>The Community Enhancement Programme,</b>was launched in 2018 to address disadvantage in urban and rural communities. The 2020 Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) with funding of &euro;2m, launched in June.  Additionally, a further &euro;5m from the July stimulus package, was launched by the Department in August 2020, under the CEP for community centres and community buildings. </p><p><b>Under Project Ireland 2040,</b>the Government has committed to providing <b>&euro;1 billion</b>for a new <b>Rural Regeneration and Development Fund</b>over the period 2019 to 2027. Initial funding of &euro;315m was secured over the period 2019 to 2022.  This represents an unprecedented commitment by Government to strengthen our rural economies and communities. The objective of the Fund is to support collaborative, coordinated and complementary packages of investment between Departments, agencies, Local Authorities and other public bodies, to pool their assets and work with communities to generate improved economic activity, transforming our rural towns and villages and their outlying areas. The Fund provides an unprecedented opportunity to make a significant impact on rural communities which will transform rural Ireland for the better and shows that the Government understands the need for proper investment in rural Ireland. </p><p><b>The CL&Aacute;R programme</b>provides funding for small scale projects in designated rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population. Under the 2020 programme a &ldquo;Schools/Community Safety Measure&rdquo; is being funded. This may fund the provision of safety related infrastructure in the environs of a school or community space such as lighting, car park and footpath upgrades and digital speed safety signs. The CL&Aacute;R programme 2020, launched at the end of May, closed for applications under these measures at the end of August last. The applications received are now being assessed and it is hoped to announce successful projects by November.</p><p><b>The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) </b>is worth &euro;190m over five years to the end of 2022. My Department funds Local Development Companies to work with disadvantaged individuals and groups, offering service users an integrated range of supports i.e. Lifelong Learning and Training; CV and Interview Preparation; Personal Development Courses; Self-Employment training; Business Planning and Budgeting Supports and helping them onto a work placement programme such as CE or T?s. </p><p><b>The Community Services Programme,</b>provides funding to organisations delivering services in disadvantaged communities. More than &euro;46m is available to support community organisations under the programme in 2020.</p><p>In addition, since its establishment, my Department also relaunched the <b>Local Improvement Scheme</b>for private rural roads and laneways. </p><p>My Department published the <b>1st National Policy on Social Enterprise in 2019.</b>Social enterprises play an important role in creating jobs, in investing in people, and in supporting communities.</p><p><b>The Strategy to Support the Community &amp;amp; Voluntary Sector in Ireland Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities</b>sets out a long-term vision for our communities in Ireland. The Strategy sets a general direction for Government policy in relation to community development, local development and the community and voluntary sectors for the next five years and beyond. I was delighted funding in the 2020 Budget Allocations supports the implementation of the actions detailed in the Strategy.  This will include enhanced supports for the structures which drive local engagement in decision making &ndash; the Public Participation Networks and the Local Community Development Committees.</p><p><b>The Action Plan for Rural Development</b>which had cross-Departmental delivery, reached the end of its three-year timeframe at the end of 2019. The Forthcoming Policy for Rural Development 2020-2025 builds on the Action Plan for Rural Development, but with a more forward-looking approach to the policies, programmes and structures needed to embed economic and social development in rural areas and underscore the interdependence of urban and rural areas in national economic, social and cultural recovery.<b></b>DRCD is leading on ensuring strong coherence across key Government policies to ensure that rural communities and economies are in a strong position to:</p><p>- adapt to future challenges e.g. changing demographics within rural communities, climate change adaptation, Brexit, post-COVID recovery, and to </p><p>- take advantage of available opportunities (e.g. diversification of rural economies, new ways of working, increased Government investment targeted at balanced regional development). </p><p>The Policy will deliver for rural Ireland in an integrated and strategic way across Government, with DRCD playing a central co-ordinating role.</p><p>I am confident that these plans will propose actions that will support rural economic development and the local and the community development sectors who continue providing valuable needed services and supports to both urban and rural communities. </p><p>In the present COVID environment the supports provided by my Department to assist communities is more important than ever. In this regard, my Department will continue to host online engagements with stakeholders on the short-term and longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on rural areas and any consequential actions which need to be taken to assist the economic and social recovery of these areas.  These engagements will input into the development of the new rural policy for Ireland for 2020-2025 to be published shortly. </p></reply>

These supports enable economic growth and development and also support communities to address gaps in meeting social needs, including those caused by higher levels of deprivation. Those programmes include:</p><p>The <b>Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme</b>(<b>SICAP)</b>, is our country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention. This is a national programme that is delivered in both rural and urban areas by Local Development Companies (LDCs) to help those in the greatest need. SICAP aims to address high and persistent levels of deprivation through targeted and innovative, locally-led approaches. It targets and supports those who are disadvantaged in Irish society and less likely to use mainstream services. <b>SICAP</b>workers have extensive local connections and in-depth knowledge of available resources and supports in their area and are continuing to work to ensure the emerging needs of their locality are responded to. The response in each area differs as LDCs support local structures and needs rather than imposing general solutions. SICAP allocations to areas are informed by the Pobal Hasse Deprivation Index which measures the relative affluence or disadvantage of areas within the State. This ensures that the programme is targeting disadvantage fairly.</p><p><b>The Community Services Programme (CSP)</b>Support Fund extended in 2019, provides funding to organisations finding it difficult to meet minimum wage obligations. </p><p><b>The 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme</b>has been tailored to focus on interventions that can support the economic and social recovery of our rural towns and villages, and assist them in responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. </p><p><b>The Dublin North East Inner City Initiative (NEIC)</b>following on from the Mulvey Report, funds varied projects, from pilot drugs projects and social employment projects to community grants and events</p><p><b>The Community Enhancement Programme (CEP), </b>focuses on supporting groups in disadvantaged areas.  </p><p><b>The CL&Aacute;R programme</b>provides funding for small scale projects in designated rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population. The CL&Aacute;R programme 2020, launched at the end of May (closed for applications under these measures at the end of August last). The applications received are now being assessed and it is hoped to announce successful projects by November.</p><p><b>DRCD works closely with Local Community Development Committees, (LCDCs)</b>who are a key element of the local authorities&rsquo; strengthened role in local development and community development as envisaged in the Local Government Reform Act 2014. Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) are also responsible for preparing the community elements of 6-year Local Economic and Community Plans (LECPs).  These plans focus on measures which will enhance the quality of life and wellbeing of communities in both urban and rural settings.  This is done through a coordinated approach to planning and service delivery. Current LECPs are due for renewal in 2021/2022 and my Department will be supporting the Local Authorities and LCDCs to develop new LECPs. The LECP development process includes extensive public and stakeholder consultation.  </p><p><b>In 2018, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund</b>was launched as part of Project Ireland 2040 and this fund will provide &euro;1 billion over the next 10 years. <b>Under Project Ireland 2040,</b>the Government has committed to providing &euro;1billion for a new <b>Rural Regeneration and Development Fund</b>over the period 2019 to 2027.

The Regional Enterprise Plans, overseen by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, play a particularly important role in supporting job creation in the regions.  </p>  <p>  My own Department also contributes to job creation in rural areas through programmes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme and LEADER.  The &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will also support job creation in towns, villages and rural areas across Ireland to 2027.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing the next phase of rural development policy, which will set out measures to support the economic and social needs of rural areas over the period 2020-2025, including policy actions to support employment in rural areas.  As was the case with the Action Plan for Rural Development, the new policy will reflect a whole-of-Government commitment to rural Ireland.</p></reply>
