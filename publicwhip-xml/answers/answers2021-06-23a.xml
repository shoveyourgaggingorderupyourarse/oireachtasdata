In the Governments <i>Covid-19 Residence and Recovery 2021 The Path Ahead </i>we acknowledged that it will be important as a people that we pause and reflect, take time to remember and pay tribute both to those who have lost their lives but also to everyone who has contributed to how we have faced and are facing the challenges together.</p><p>The plan also recognises that it would be important to capture those very different experiences and to figure out what we have learned about ourselves as a society.The National Library of Ireland captures the lived experience of Ireland as it happens so it can then be shared with the world. A major focus of the National Library&rsquo;s collection in 2020/2021 has been around COVID-19.</p><p>A programme of national and local events will be developed to commemorate those we have lost, to celebrate all those who have helped us survive and endure, and ensure there is support from all those who feel alone or lost.  It is not possible with the current restrictions to organise an appropriate national commemoration.  When the time is right, there will be an opportunity for us nationally to remember those who died during this difficult time.  The Protocol and Civic Policy Division in my Department are working with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on the format for a national commemoration, which is still under consideration.</p></reply>

The EU&rsquo;s participation in the recent G7 discussions, where additional commitments on the provision of vaccines globally was agreed, bears witness to that.</p>  <p>  International Trade is a competence of the EU under the Treaties.  In exercising that competence at the World Trade Organisation or WTO, the European Commission engages with Member States, including Ireland, through a variety of Committee and Working Parties/Groups, including on intellectual property, or IP.</p>  <p>  South Africa and India amended their original proposal for a waiver by broadening the scope; it now covers all COVID-19 related health products and technologies for prevention, treatment, and containment of the disease and provides that the waiver shall be in force for 3 years and that only the WTO General Council in a consensus decision could determine the date of termination of the waiver.  </p>  <p>  On the 4th of June, the EU submitted a proposal to the WTO General Council, which proposes that WTO Members could agree on a global trade initiative for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics encompassing the three components of (i) trade facilitation and disciplines on export restrictions; (ii) concrete actions to expand production and ensure supply of vaccines at affordable prices to low and middle income countries during the pandemic and (iii) clarification and facilitation of TRIPS Agreement flexibilities relating to compulsory licenses.  </p>  <p>  Production capacity is a key issue here and, again at the G7 earlier this month, the EU Commission announced &euro;1b in funding for the building of production capacity in Africa, which will create long-term production capacity in Africa.  The US Government announced its support for a waiver of IP protection for COVID-19 vaccines only.  The statement acknowledged that reaching agreement on this at the WTO will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved.</p>  <p>  The EU continues to be committed to an open and comprehensive dialogue with all WTO members to explore how the multilateral rules-based trading system can best support universal and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.</p>  <p>  The EU believes that the WTO international agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (The TRIPS Agreement), allows countries the flexibility to respond to the concerns raised by proponents of the waiver.  Specifically, the TRIPS Agreement allows compulsory licensing which is when a government permits an entity to produce the patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner.</p>  <p>  The EU also believes that voluntary licensing and the dissemination of technology and know-how is the more effective way of quickly scaling up manufacturing globally.</p>  <p>  The EU considers that the COVAX Facility, the international initiative to ensure global supply and access to COVID-19 vaccines, is the mechanism that is best placed to ensure that high-income countries finance the vaccines and support the developing countries to secure their share of global supply.</p>  <p>  The EU has also submitted a proposal for a Declaration to the WTO TRIPS Council, which seeks to clarify how the existing TRIPS flexibilities could be more effective than a waiver.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will engage with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position for the WTO discussions on how the intellectual property protections flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines can help to resolve the crisis and contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.</p></reply>

The public consultation period was extended until April 2020 as the Covid-19 epidemic meant that not all stakeholders could comply with the original deadline.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently reviewing the extremely detailed responses to the public consultation and hope to have recommendations on any revised regulations later in the year.</p></reply>

Provisional application is a standard mechanism provided for in the EU&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements.  This means that those areas where the EU has full competence may be applied immediately once the Agreement has been voted for by Council and the European Parliament. It is an important mechanism that allows consumers and companies to benefit from a trade agreement at an early stage, as the completion of national ratification procedures across all 27 Member States can take several years.  </p>  <p>  The positive impact of the provisional application of the Agreement has been plain to see with goods exports to Canada increased from EUR 953 million in 2016 to more than EUR 1.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 78 per cent, while services exports grew from EUR 1.6 billion in 2016 to more than EUR 2.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 44 per cent. </p>  <p>Looking further at the tangible benefits of this Agreement, my Department has recently released the results of an independent study of the potential economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland from the European Union&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements with Canada as well as South Korea, Mexico and Japan. The study, released on 28 April, encompasses state of the art quantitative modelling and qualitative analysis, including a comprehensive programme of stakeholder engagement with business and agriculture representatives and found that these four EU FTAs are forecast to have a positive effect on trade, GDP and national income in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The full coming into force of the Agreement once ratified across all Member States, will see the implementation of the Investment Chapter of the Agreement including the resolution of disputes between investors and states, should they arise.  All international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements.  Where such agreements cover (i) trade in both goods and services and (ii) investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments.  The EU&rsquo;s new approach to investment protection is the Investment Court System (ICS) which is contained in CETA and replaces the old Investor-State Dispute Settlement or ISDS mechanism.  I have set out for the House, on many occasions previously, the improvements ICS represents over the older ISDS.</p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada&rsquo;s right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection. And while CETA does not prevent a party pursuing a claim through domestic courts, the ICS element of CETA is specifically designed to provide an arbitration alternative to either EU investors in Canada or Canadian investors in the EU. </p>  <p>  In relation to the "locally-based cultural industries and artists" highlighted by the Deputy, Canada and the EU are both signatories of the UNESCO Convention of Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions and this is explicitly "affirmed" in CETA, including the "right to preserve, develop and implement their cultural policies, to support their cultural industries for the purpose of strengthening the diversity of cultural expressions and to preserve their cultural identity, including through the use of regulatory measures and financial support". Importantly, Article 7.7 of CETA explicitly provides that: "Noting in this Agreement applies to subsidies or government support with respect to audio-visual services for the European Union and to cultural industries for Canada."  In this context, my Department sees no issues arising under the terms of CETA that would impact Ireland's entitlement to support locally-based cultural industries and artists.</p></reply>

The code sets out that the cost should be based on the midpoint of the salary scale and include employer&rsquo;s salary related PRSI, imputed pension costs and overheads e.g.  ICT equipment, legal costs, travel and subsistence.</p><p>Using the same methodology, the cost of ten additional inspectors would be approximately &euro;613,410.</p><p>The gross basic pay, exclusive of any of the additional costs set out above, at the first point of the Executive Office Scale (the scale to which WRC inspectors are assigned) would be &euro;30,884 for one officer or &euro;308,840 for ten.</p><p>My Department fully supports and continues to work closely with the WRC in monitoring its staffing and budgetary requirements. This includes anticipating future resource requirements to ensure that it is supported and adequately resourced to carry out its important work. </p><p>Currently, there are 2 competitions ongoing with the Public Appointments Service. Interviews for a HEO Inspector Team Manager competition have been finalised and the WRC expect 2 appointments from that competition shortly. </p><p>A recruitment drive for EO Inspectors is also underway. This will create a panel to enable vacancies to be filled and could potentially be used to increase inspector numbers in future, if the WRC deem it to be necessary.</p><p>The Department in conjunction with the Director General of the WRC is currently actively reviewing staffing levels of the WRC inspection services.</p><p>The WRC&rsquo;s funding allocation for 2021 is &euro;15.17 million for pay and non-pay. I am confident that the funding provided by my Department to the WRC is sufficient to ensure that the body is adequately resourced to respond to any additional demands on services.</p></reply>

Ireland is currently an outlier among its peer nations in not providing for any statutory employer sick pay and is one of only three EU member states that does not do so. </p><p>  Any move to introduce a statutory sick pay scheme must be balanced with the need to support the viability of the business and enterprise sector, thereby protecting jobs. Therefore, appropriate examination of all implications and consultation with stakeholders is essential to the development of the scheme. We don&rsquo;t want to jeopardise jobs by placing a cost and/or admin burden on business without working through all of the implications and potential solutions. That is why we undertook a full public consultation, reviewed international best practice, and formed an interdepartmental group &ndash; to ensure that all views and issues were properly considered in the development of the scheme.  Research in this area has shown that where companies have a sick pay scheme in place it leads to safer workplace environments and reduces presenteeism. </p><p>  The scheme will be designed to take an incremental approach with enhancements coming over a number of years. This is to give employers, particularly employers who may have had to close or been negatively impacted due to Covid-19 restrictions, an opportunity to adjust to costs and the administrative burden of the scheme. However, in line with statutory sick pay schemes throughout the European Union, the intention of the scheme is that employers will cover the cost of an initial period where one of their employees is unable to work due to illness or injury. </p><p>The rate of 70% of an employee's wage, subject to a daily threshold of &euro;110, is designed to ensure that employees receive an appropriate level of financial compensation if they are unable to attend work due to illness. It is higher than the equivalent rate  in Northern Ireland, which,  in my view is inadequate. </p><p>It is my intention that the scheme will be in place for 2022.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided to households under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was &euro;14,800 in 2020.</p><p>A total of &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes in 2021. Of this amount, &euro;109 million is provided to support lower income households to retrofit their homes, with &euro;100 million allocated to the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme.  This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation for energy poverty schemes and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty.  The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. However, COVID-19 public health restrictions on construction activity in 2020 and between January and April 2021 have unfortunately negatively impacted on the programme. The number of new applicants for the Warmer Homes Scheme in 2019, 2020 and year to date 2021 is set out in the table below.</p><p><b>Table 1: New Applicants for the Warmer Homes Scheme - 2019-2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>YEAR</th>       <th>NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVED</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>5,682</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>2,786</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 (to end May)</td>       <td>1,140</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td>9,608</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of households who have applied for the warmer homes scheme retrofit grant that have children in their homes is not available as neither my Department nor the SEAI collects such information.</p><p>Data provided by SEAI following a review of applications indicates that the approximate breakdown of homes on the work programme by qualifying grant payment is as set out in the table below.

The purpose of the charge was to effect behaviour change regarding disposal of waste to landfill and this has been successful with just 3 landfills currently in operation in the State, a reduction from 31 in 2008. In addition, our landfill rate for municipal waste was just 14% in 2018, compared to a figure of 62% recorded for 2008.    The waste management market in Ireland is serviced by private companies, where prices charged are a contract matter between those companies and their customers.

My Department is currently developing the next National Implementation Plan which I intend to publish later this year. The plan will set out a robust framework to support coherent SDG implementation across Government and the mainstreaming of the SDGs into existing policies.</p>  <p>  A fundamental feature of the 2030 Agenda is the inclusive and active voice stakeholders had in both the negotiation and adoption of the Agenda. Achieving sustainable development, and particularly the targets and commitments set out in the 17 SDGs, will require not only action by Government but all individuals across society. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I intend to shortly launch a public consultation to review the performance of the previous Plan and inform the design and structure of the next iteration of the Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

EirGrid, the electricity grid operator, has over the last decade overseen significant investment in the power system in the order of &euro;1.7 billion to achieve our energy targets up to 2020. The last decade has also seen the connection of over 2.8GW of renewable generation across 92 windfarm developments and an increased level of interconnection with the energisation of the 500MW East-West Interconnector to Wales. In addition, EirGrid has added over 800km of new circuits by working with communities, connecting to 34 new substation locations as well as additional improvements and upgrades to existing circuits and substations to maintain security of supply.</p>  <p>  The next 10 years will see a need for developing approximately 12GW of renewable power by harnessing the power of offshore wind and a range of new and existing technologies. EirGrid anticipates that the development of the grid will require levels of investment of circa &euro;2 billion over the next decade and see the completion of further electricity interconnection to France. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, EirGrid recently concluded a public consultation, 'Shaping our Electricity Future', which considers how we can best meet our 70% renewables target by 2030. The grid of tomorrow will need to become stronger and more flexible and this consultation will inform how EirGrid can best deliver these investments to see Ireland achieve the Climate Action Plan targets in electricity in a balanced way and support our transition to a net zero carbon economy by 2050.</p></reply>

While it was originally my intention to launch the Strategy alongside a public consultation on a new solid fuel regulation for Ireland, recognising the urgency of taking action to address the health impacts of domestic solid fuel burning, I have chosen to progress the development of enhanced solid fuel regulations in advance. This decision has also allowed submissions received during the public consultation process to inform and contribute to the final strategy document. </p>  <p>  I will be moving now to develop a new, legally robust, and evidence-based framework for how we regulate all solid fuels used for domestic burning. This will be a central plank of the Clean Air Strategy which will also identify and promote the integrated measures and actions across Government required to reduce air pollution, which I intend to publish shortly.</p></reply>

As such, a licence should not have, by association, a monetary value or be tradable on the open market. As quantitative restrictions have been removed from the taxi market and there are no barriers to entry to this industry - other than the obligation to use a wheelchair accessible vehicle (WAV) - it is not clear how the transferring of licences would deliver benefits to the industry or members of the public that use these services, especially those who require access to WAVs. Accordingly, there is no basis for a "buy back" scheme of the type outlined by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The IRCG partnered with the Great Place To Work (GPTW) Institute to jointly develop an engagement strategy called the &lsquo;Trust Index &amp;amp; Culture Assessment (TCA) campaign&rsquo;. This programme is applicable equally to all personnel and is specifically designed to solicit their personal perspectives in support of the organisational reform programme.</p><p>This programme measures the extent to which an organisation is considered &ldquo;great&rdquo; by those who are engaged in its operations, by gathering qualitative and quantitative data on personnel perceptions of their organisational experiences, and enabling the organisation&rsquo;s leadership to understand how to best improve the operating environment. Another key aspect is the &lsquo;Culture Assessment&rsquo; tool which provides external analysis of the policies, practices, programs and day-to-day management behaviours that underpin an organisation&rsquo;s culture.</p><p>These tools allow the IRCG to assess the level of trust within the organisation and to demonstrate its longer-term commitment to listening to its members, actioning upon the feedback received and to developing a &lsquo;just&rsquo; culture.</p><p>Accordingly, in the most recent assessment of the Irish Coast Guard, 72% of those surveyed expressed Medium to High Trust in the Organisation. Whereas in terms of &ldquo;Pride&rdquo;, &ldquo;Camaraderie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Respect&rdquo;, measurements were externally recorded as 86%, 80% and 70% respectively.  These tools also benchmark the Irish Coast Guard against all other organisations certified by the GPTW institute for 2020-21.

However, passengers with a DCC based on a non-PCR test (for example, an antigen test), or those arriving without a DCC, will require proof of a negative RT-PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival. Passengers who have been in a non-EU/EEA country in the 14 days prior to arrival into Ireland will be subject to the rules applying to travel from that country. All passengers will be advised to observe public health restrictions and to present for post-arrival testing if they develop symptoms of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, from 19 July, Ireland will also broadly align itself to the EU approach to non-essential travel into the EU from third countries (outside EU/EEA).  To protect its citizens against the importation of variants, an &lsquo;emergency brake&rsquo; mechanism will be coordinated at EU level to react swiftly to the emergence of a variant of concern or variant of interest.</p></reply>

Aer Lingus flights on the Shannon &ndash; London/Heathrow route are expected to resume in September. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the significant challenges being faced by Cork and Shannon airports, the Government established a Covid-19 Regional State Airports Programme earlier this year.  This is providing both capital and operational supports to these airports in 2021 with an available budget of &euro;32.1m.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 24 February 2021, my Department secured European Commission approval for a &euro;26 million funding scheme for Irish Airports.  As part of this scheme, a &euro;20m damages measure has been established to support State airports (Dublin, Cork and Shannon).  This funding will provide State airports with flexibility to roll out route incentives/charges rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently assessing applications for this funding and would hope to be in a position to disburse this compensation in the coming weeks.  In order to ensure parity of treatment, funding will be allocated to airports proportionate to the damage caused.  In this regard, funding will be allocated proportionately in line with 2019 passenger numbers at the airports.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-23a.146.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062300078#WRE02600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 to 92, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was in place for 22 weeks between 26 March and 31 August 2020. It was introduced as an emergency income support for eligible employees where the employer&rsquo;s business activities were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 66,600 employers received a subsidy under the TWSS with payments of &euro;2.8 billion paid out to a total of 664,500 workers. The scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020.</p><p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the operation of the EWSS, which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.</p><p>To date, EWSS payments of over &euro;3.521 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;575 million have been granted to over 50,000 employers in respect of over 583,000 employees.</p><p>While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, position of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS.</p><p>The objective of scheme is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times.</p><p>I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 1st June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021.</p><p>With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of December 2021.</p><p>As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).</p><p>For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. There are no changes in respect of the qualification criteria for EWSS eligibility for the childcare sector.</p><p>The Government has approved the extension of the EWSS for Q4 2021, however, it is considered too early as yet to prescribe the precise operational parameters of the scheme that should apply for that quarter. Decisions in that regard will be taken closer to the time, possibly around the end of August/early September, with the benefit of more up-to-date information on a number of variables, including the overall epidemiological situation, progress made in reopening all sectors of the economy, the vaccine efficacy, as well as the operation of the EWSS during the early parts of Q3. As such, no decisions have yet been taken on any changes to the scheme for Q4 2021.</p><p>It is important that, as the recovery gains further momentum, supports are further recalibrated in the longer-term interests of businesses that are in receipt of those supports and in the interests of the wider body of taxpayers. As such and as already signalled, for Q4, consideration will be given to a future change to EWSS which will require an employer contribution towards employee wages. As with all firms that will benefit from the scheme in the months ahead, businesses in the childcare sector also would be subject to the impact of this potential change.</p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions in relation to the amount of funding allocated to the EWSS generally and for specific childcare sub-sectors, the position is that it is a demand led scheme and as such the cost is driven by the number of employers and employees supported by the scheme. This was also the case for its predecessor, the TWSS. My Department develops cost estimates to inform the Government in good time in advance of any specific decisions being made in respect of the scheme. The process involves liaison and cooperation, as appropriate, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and with the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>However, due to the fact that EWSS operates as a demand led scheme, a particular amount of funding is not allocated to any specific sector, including the childcare sector.  This was the case in relation to the TWSS also.  The EWSS is administered by Revenue and is paid for by funds allocated to the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>To assist the Deputy in understanding the extent to which the TWSS and EWSS supported the childcare sector, the table below provided by Revenue, gives an indication of the number of employers supported and the amount of subsidies paid out under the EWSS and TWSS to employers in the childcare sector, from inception of each scheme to May 2021 (the latest available data). This data is based on businesses classified to the childcare sector using the NACE code classification system.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Number(Employers) </th>       <th>&euro;m </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TWSS </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>March 2020 </td>       <td>420 </td>       <td>2.7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April 2020 </td>       <td>2,100 </td>       <td>25.6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May 2020 </td>       <td>2,210 </td>       <td>23.0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June 2020 </td>       <td>2,230 </td>       <td>20.4 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July 2020 </td>       <td>1,640 </td>       <td>19.6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>August 2020 </td>       <td>1,610 </td>       <td>16.8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>EWSS </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July/August 2020 </td>       <td>360 </td>       <td>1.1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>September 2020 </td>       <td>2,310 </td>       <td>16.5 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>October 2020 </td>       <td>2,400 </td>       <td>25.0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>November 2020 </td>       <td>2,410 </td>       <td>27.0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>December 2020 </td>       <td>2,400 </td>       <td>29.5 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>January 2021 </td>       <td>2,440 </td>       <td>27.8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>February 2021 </td>       <td>2,480 </td>       <td>26.0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>March 2021 </td>       <td>2.520 </td>       <td>28.1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April 2021 </td>       <td>2,470 </td>       <td>30.6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May 2021 </td>       <td>2,460 </td>       <td>28.1 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Consequently, all AHBs revenue and expenditure is classified as general government revenue and general government expenditure while borrowing by the AHBs, from outside the General Government sector i.e. the private sector, will add to the general government debt. As the schemes highlighted by the Deputy finance AHBs for various services, they are consolidated within the general government accounts as flows between general government bodies, but as the AHB&rsquo;s spend these monies, general government expenditures are recorded.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the EU&rsquo;s fiscal rules, as set out in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), are an integral part of the EU&rsquo;s broader economic governance framework. The key components of the fiscal rules are a 3 per cent of GDP threshold for the headline (General Government) deficit, a 60 per cent debt-to-GDP threshold, a balanced budget after adjusting for the economic cycle (measured by the structural balance) and the expenditure benchmark. As the AHBs are classified in the General Government sector, all AHBs revenue and expenditure fall under the scope of the EU fiscal rules framework. </p>  <p>  The normal operation of the EU fiscal rules has been suspended since March 2020, when the so-called General Escape Clause (GEC) of the SGP was activated. This clause allows Member States to depart from the regular budgetary requirements under the Pact in order to allow them to take all necessary measures to effectively address the pandemic, sustain the economy and support the ensuing recovery. While the activation of the GEC means the regular fiscal requirements have been temporarily suspended, it must be noted that the Pact itself has not been suspended or revoked but remains in place, providing an important anchor for fiscal policy over the medium-term. As part of the recent announcement by the European Commission of its 2021 Spring Package, the Commission confirmed that the General Escape Clause of the Pact will remain in force in 2022, and is expected to be de-activated in 2023.</p></reply>

In 2020, PUP was taxed at year end rather than in the normal real-time manner due to the urgent requirement to get payments to people as quickly as possible. For PAYE employees, where tax liabilities remain for 2020 after all tax credits and entitlements are allocated, the amount due can be collected, interest free, over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing their tax credits. </p>  <p>  The situation for self-employed workers is different in that the tax due on PUP payments received in 2020 is accounted for by completing the usual self-assessed tax return by 31 October 2021 and paying the amount due (17 November 2021 if filing and paying via ROS). In situations where a self-assessed taxpayer cannot pay the tax due it may be possible to avail of the Debt Warehousing Scheme or a suitable phased payment arrangement. Further information on the Debt Warehousing Scheme is available on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  The continuation of the PUP into 2021 has re-established the practice of operating PAYE in the normal (real-time) manner for such payments. However, people receiving PUP payments in 2021 will only pay tax when they return to work. The tax due is collected over the remaining pay periods in 2021 by reducing the person&rsquo;s tax credits. For self-employed people, with no income taxed under PAYE, the tax due on PUP payments received in 2021 will not fall due until October 2022.</p>  <p>  Revenue further advise me that the person in question is self-employed and is also in receipt of an occupational pension. The tax due on the PUP payments received in 2021 is being collected by reducing the tax credits allocated to his occupational pension. The tax due on the PUP payments received in 2020 should be included in his 2020 tax return. If he is unable to pay the amount due, Revenue has assured me that it will engage with him regarding the situation. This will include the possibility of warehousing the debt, assuming he meets the eligibility criteria for that scheme, or alternatively providing him with a phased payment option that best suits his circumstances, thereby ensuring any financial hardship is minimised to the greatest extent possible.    </p></reply>

Furthermore, if the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

The relief was introduced in 2001 and abolished from 2011 onwards. </p><p>A review of the appropriate treatment for tax purposes of trade union subscriptions and professional body fees was carried out by my Department in 2016 and included in the 2016 report on tax expenditures published on Budget day 2016. </p><p>The review concluded that:</p><p>&quot;...analysis of the scheme using the principles laid down by the Department&rsquo;s Tax Expenditure Guidelines shows that it fails to reach the evaluation threshold to warrant introduction in this manner. </p><p>The reinstatement of this tax relief would have no justifiable policy rationale and does not express a defined policy objective. Given that individuals join trade unions largely for the well-known benefits of membership, and the potential value of the relief to an individual would equate to just over &euro;1 per week, this scheme would have little to no incentive effect on the numbers choosing to join. There is no specific market failure that needs to be addressed by such a scheme, and it would consist largely of deadweight.&quot;</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that there are no current data available from tax returns on the number of taxpayers with union subscriptions or the cost of their individual union subscriptions. Therefore, there is no basis for Revenue on which to estimate a cost for this measure.</p><p>The following table sets out details of the cost of the tax relief for trade union subscriptions in the seven years immediately prior to its end:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Cost (&euro; million)</th>       <th>No. of  Claims</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2004</td>       <td>10.7</td>       <td>248,300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2005</td>       <td>11.8</td>       <td>272,100</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2006</td>       <td>19.2</td>       <td>294,300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2007</td>       <td>20.7</td>       <td>316,300</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2008</td>       <td>26.4</td>       <td>341,900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2009</td>       <td>26.7</td>       <td>345,800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2010</td>       <td>26.0</td>       <td>337,500</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The detailed and comprehensive protocols applied for sports training and competition are aligned with international best practice, and informed by experience. It is regrettable that at this time, it is not possible to permit a broader return to mass events, but the current restrictions are clear that matches and competitive sporting events are not permitted except for those governed and overseen by recognised NGBs.</p>  <p>  As the summer goes on and the vaccination rollout continues the restrictions we must operate under will lessen, and I expect that larger events will be possible in due course.</p></reply>

As part of that funding, on Tuesday June 15th I announced the allocations for the &euro;25m Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS 2021).All allocations of funding for arts, culture and entertainment purposes made by my Department are subject to approval by me as Minister.</p><p>I was delighted to be in a position to fund 237 successful applications under this scheme, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  There was a very high level of interest in this scheme, with over 400 applications requesting funding in excess of &euro;80 million. Given the available funding of &euro;25 million, difficult decisions had to be made and it was not be possible to award grants to everyone who applied. The 237 grants awarded will help support employment and well-being opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. </p><p>All applications were referred to an Evaluation Panel for assessment and recommendations for allocations which were then subject to approval.  The Evaluation Panel consisted of five members, independent from the administration area running the scheme. Along with two department representatives, the external members were as follows; Mr. Gary Sheehan, Head of Programme Planning at the National Concert Hall, Mr. Ciaran Walsh &ndash; a freelance theatre producer and currently Showcase Manager with Culture Ireland, and Ms. Louise Donlon Executive Director of the Lime Tree Theatre, Mary Immaculate College, and Belltable, in Limerick&rsquo;s city centre. </p><p>All panel members were required to sign a declaration regarding conflict of interest and confidentiality in relation to this scheme.</p><p>Officials in my Department are engaging with applicants in relation to queries regarding the outcome of their Live Performance Support Scheme application.

From 5 July, if the public health situation allows, organised indoor events can recommence, permitting a maximum of 50 attendees at the majority of venues and 100 in larger venues. Currently 100 people can attend an organised outdoor event for the majority of venues. </p>  <p>  The Government has agreed that pilot events will take place in June and July, depending on the epidemiological situation at the time and subject to the roll out of the vaccination programme. My Department has worked with the Arts Council and a number of stakeholder engagement structures are in place to support the development and delivery of those pilot events. The first event took place in the Iveagh Gardens on the 10th of June in collaboration with the National Concert Hall and further events will take place across the course of the summer. These events will assist in safely charting a path back to greater levels of activity in line with developments in public health guidance over the coming weeks and months.  Pilot events are necessary as a proof of concept for the safe management of events whilst COVID-19 is still circulating in our communities and in order to evaluate and build confidence in the COVID-19 guidance and event management protocols developed by the culture and sports sectors.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have established a Return to Live Entertainment Working Group to facilitate stakeholder consultation and develop COVID-19 Guidelines for the Live Entertainment sector.  The Group includes stakeholders from across the live entertainment sector as well and those with appropriate technical knowledge in the planning, management and delivery of events.  The Group is developing a set of overarching guiding principles that all venue promoters can adopt for their specific purposes. The Live Entertainment Working Group includes stakeholders with appropriate technical knowledge in the planning, management and delivery of events and is will produce a set of overarching guiding principles which all venue promoters can adopt for their specific purposes. </p>  <p>  In parallel with these developments, Government continues to provide a range of supports to the arts, culture and entertainment sectors.  Primary support for the arts, including supports for music is delivered by the Arts Council. In 2021, the Government allocated &euro;130m to the Arts Council which is an increase of 62% over the amount initially allocated for 2020. The Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003. The Arts Council's support is by way of grants under a range of categories including bursary, strategic funding, project awards and touring and dissemination awards.  The Arts Council announced details of its investment plans last February and this included a range of initiatives aimed at supporting artists and arts organisation through the crisis. </p>  <p>  I allocated &euro;50 million to a suite of measures to assist the live performance sector.  As part of that funding, I announced the allocations for the &euro;25m Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS 2021).  I was delighted to be in a position to fund 237 successful applications under this scheme, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  These grants will help support employment and well-being opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.</p>  <p>  I have also made an allocation of &euro;14m available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports. Under the scheme, self-employed businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio equipment suppliers operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector are eligible to apply. Applications may be made via the MEBAS application portal on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Earlier in the year,  I announced the pilot Outdoor Public Space Scheme 2021 intended to fund local authorities to adapt, equip or otherwise improve public spaces for cultural and events activities, taking account of public health guidelines and of the needs of the local arts community. Outdoor public spaces that can provide year-round use can improve well-being and contribute positively to the public realm. </p>  <p>  Related to this, I have also made an allocation of &euro;5 million available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  &euro;5 million will also be made available for a scheme of capital supports for the commercial live entertainment sector.</p>  <p>  In addition, I recently announced a new Events Sector Covid Support Scheme which I intend to launch shortly.  This scheme will target SMEs in the events sector which aren&rsquo;t eligible for the CRSS and for whom MEBAS and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19 will not make a significant contribution to fixed costs relative to the level of support that would be available under CRSS, had such SMEs been eligible for that support. </p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan also includes a commitment for Government to prioritise a Basic Income guarantee pilot scheme for artists. This was a key recommendation of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that under the Economic Recovery Plan, Government has extended the period during which a range of horizontal and business supports will be available to enterprises and workers in all sectors of the economy, including the Arts and Culture sectors.  Measures include:</p>  <p>  - Extending the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 31 December.</p>  <p>  - Extending the Pandemic Unemployment Payment beyond 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  - Extending the Commercial Rates Waiver to end-September 2021.</p>  <p>  - Broadening of eligibility criteria for the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19, which opens the scheme up to businesses in non-rated premises.</p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan also sets out the intention to introduce a new, additional and more streamlined business support scheme in September 2021, called the Business Resumption Support Scheme.</p></reply>

These include:</p>  <p>  - Extending the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS). Revisions will see payments for businesses reopening of up to &euro;30,000.</p>  <p>  - Extending the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 31 December.</p>  <p>  - Extending the Commercial Rates Waiver to end-September 2021.</p>  <p>  - Broadening of eligibility criteria for the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19, which opens the scheme up to businesses in non-rated premises.</p>  <p>  - The ERP sets out the intention to introduce a new, additional and more streamlined business support scheme in September 2021, called the Business Resumption Support Scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition to benefiting from revised and extended horizontal supports, the Economic Recovery Plan also provides for an extension of the 9% VAT rate to September 2022, which will continue to act as a stimulus for the tourism sector as it moves towards recovery.</p>  <p>  These measures and supports will provide tourism businesses, including registered guesthouses and the wider tourism accommodation sector, with much-needed clarity that will enable them to plan longer-term with confidence and accept bookings.  The ERP also commits to continuing to provide business continuity schemes through F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p>  <p>  Taking into account the new and revised horizontal supports set out in the ERP, I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to examine what supports will be needed for the tourism sector in the coming months.  I will discuss these proposed supports with colleagues across Government to ensure that the tourism and hospitality sector is supported in their recovery as we reopen our society and our economy.  The Tourism Recovery Oversight Group, which I appointed last December to oversee the implementation of the Recovery Plan and monitor the recovery of the sector, will also continue to be a key input into my thinking with regard to further support for the tourism sector.</p></reply>

Each of these deaths is a tragedy and I extend my sympathies to the families concerned. The deaths of people availing of homeless services are a concern and are being taken very seriously. It is important that we establish the facts concerning the circumstances involved, and that we base our response on the best knowledge and evidence available.</p>  <p>  A review of homeless deaths was undertaken on behalf of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) by Dr. Austin O&rsquo;Carroll, the HSE appointed Clinical Lead for Covid-19 and Homelessness in Dublin.  The review analysed the available data concerning deaths in homeless services for 2020 to identify learning for homeless and health services that could help tailor the provision of care to homeless people. This &lsquo;Interim Report on Mortality in Single Homeless Population 2020&rsquo; was submitted to me earlier this month. Owing to certain data limitations, including Covid-19 restrictions limiting access to coroner&rsquo;s reports, the report will be subject to revision when these data become available. I have met with Dr. O&rsquo;Carroll to discuss the report and its recommendations.</p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to ensure that all individuals experiencing homelessness are supported to exit into permanent housing solutions and that those with complex health and mental health needs are provided with the supports they need. My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities in respect of these issues.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes measures targeted specifically at those experiencing homelessness with complex needs. It commits to the continued expansion of Housing First, and, importantly, ensuring that health and mental health supports are provided. The provision of addiction and mental health supports has featured prominently in meetings of the High Level Homelessness Task Force that I established and in my regular interactions with the Minister for Health. The issue of deaths in homeless services has also been discussed at the Task Force.</p>  <p>  Engaging with rough sleepers is vital. This engagement is first and foremost to encourage those rough sleeping to avail of shelter. But critically, it also allows their health needs to be assessed and provided for.</p>  <p>  In addition to the recent report, and relevant to its recommendations in respect of improving data in this area, a separate feasibility study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally is being undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health. This is due to be completed by the end of 2021. The research is applying the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, is reviewing approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts.</p></reply>

The range of objectives, and actions it specifies, have been pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock. In that context, each of the 31 local authorities have prepared and activated a Vacant Homes Action Plan for their administrative area. The Vacant Home Action Plan identifies the scale of vacant homes in their jurisdiction and sets ambitious but realistic targets of the number of vacant homes that can ultimately be brought back into use.  </p>  <p>  My Department does not hold the data on the number of empty or unoccupied domestic dwellings in the State.</p>  <p>  My Department is focused on ensuring that existing housing stock is utilised to its fullest extent including a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across Ireland. In that regard, my Department and local authorities are being proactive in dealing with vacant properties and there are a number of schemes available to incentivise reactivating suitable dwellings into the liveable housing stock such as: </p>  <p>- The Repair and Leasing Scheme   is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties. The scheme provides upfront funding to carry out the works and, in return, the property owner agrees to lease the dwelling to the local authority to be used as social housing for a period up to 25 years. The maximum loan for property repair available under the Repair and Lease scheme has been increased by my Department from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000. 247 properties have been brought back into use under the Repair and lease scheme.  </p>  <p>- The Buy and Renew   initiative allows local authorities to purchase private vacant properties for use as social housing. 670 properties have been brought back into use under the scheme. </p>  <p>- The Housing Acquisitions Fund   is a &euro;70 million revolving that was established in January 2017 with the objective of enabling the Housing Agency to acquire vacant units from banks and investment companies for social housing use. The fund is replenished by the Housing Agency through the sale of units primarily to the AHB sector and the funds received are then recycled back into the fund for future acquisitions. To date 844 properties have been brought back into use through the fund. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the Vacant Homes Schemes and the various functions of the Vacant Homes Offices under review with ongoing feedback from our Vacant Homes Officers. </p></reply>

When first introduced in 2018, this arrangement applied to social housing projects up to the value of &euro;2m but I increased the value of eligible projects to &euro;6m in September 2020, to give further options to local authorities.</p><p>At the same time, I recognise that other improvements we have initiated in respect of social housing projects have improved the process through which local authorities engage with my Department as they advance their construction projects. For example, local authorities now have the benefit of standard layouts for new build social housing, as well as standard specifications and guideline costs. These supports give local authorities clear parameters within which to design and develop new social housing construction projects and reduce the issues that will arise with the approval assessments. </p><p>Notwithstanding these improvements, I am still keen to see more take-up of the single-stage process for suitable social housing projects and particularly by local authorities who have not taken this opportunity to date.  My Department will continue to work proactively with local authorities to encourage further use of the single stage process and I believe there is also merit in public representatives pressing their local authorities on this.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority</th>       <th>Projects</th>       <th>Units</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>40</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway County</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>25</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

While Sudan has made significant headway in its reform efforts, significant challenges remain, including violence in Darfur, and an economic crisis. There are also significant delays in implementing the Juba Peace Agreement (JPA) between the Transitional Government and rebel groups, including on transitional justice and accountability measures.</p>  <p>  The events of 3 June 2019 in Khartoum were deeply alarming. Minister Coveney, at the time, issued a statement strongly condemning the use of violence and excessive force against protestors. He also condemned the use of sexual and gender based violence against protestors. The UN Security Council and the EU also denounced the violence. Senior officials from my Department met the then Sudanese Ambassador to Ireland in 2019 to express our concerns at the political situation. In 2019, officials also met with representatives of the Sudanese community in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Ireland has taken the opportunity at several sessions of the UN Human Rights Council to condemn the violence against protestors on 3 June and to call for accountability through independent investigations. </p>  <p>  As the two-year anniversary of the event has now passed, it is regrettable that the findings of the official investigation are still outstanding. It is imperative that all violations against protestors, including widespread reports of sexual and gender-based violence, are independently investigated and the perpetrators held accountable. Ending impunity and ensuring that those responsible are brought to justice are essential steps on the road to peace in Sudan.</p>  <p>  As a member of the UN Security Council, we are also closely monitoring events in Sudan, in particular efforts to ensure the protection of civilians. We have consistently raised the need for accountability for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in our statements at the Council. In addition, we have encouraged the Transitional Government to prioritise the establishment and implementation of the transitional justice mechanisms and processes agreed in the JPA.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong supporter of the International Criminal Court (ICC). While the ICC is central to the overall framework for international criminal justice, it is a court of last resort and States bear the primary responsibility to investigate the most serious international crimes. Referrals by the United Nations Security Council to the ICC are pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, and must receive nine affirmative votes at the Council without one of the Five Permanent Council Members vetoing the referral.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to engage with our EU partners to ensure a strong and unified EU position on the situation in Sudan. Ireland is also a long-standing humanitarian donor to Sudan. Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;39 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Sudan through UN, and NGO partners. So far this year, we have provided over &euro;4.6 million in funding. </p>  <p>  My officials continue to actively monitor political developments and the humanitarian and human rights situation in Sudan, including through Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Nairobi, in cooperation with the EU Delegation in Khartoum.</p></reply>

My advice to those seeking to apply for a US student visa is to monitor the US Embassy in Dublin's website and to engage with them directly on visa appointment issues.</p>  <p>  I understand, however, that this is a very difficult and uncertain time for those who wish to travel to the US to study. My officials have raised the issue with the US Embassy in Dublin, encouraging them to process student visas as soon as it is feasible and safe to do so. Together with other EU countries, we have also written to US Secretary of State Blinken requesting reconsideration of the US travel restrictions currently in place. This letter specifically references the plight of those wishing to apply for student visas.</p>  <p>  Ireland is deeply committed to supporting exchanges between our two countries at every level. These play an essential role in building transatlantic understanding and extraordinary academic links. Such exchanges are also vital to our economic relationships, and for building people-to-people connections across the Atlantic. My Department has a very strong and positive working relationship with the US Charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires and her team at the US Embassy in Dublin. We will continue to maintain regular contact with the Embassy, and with the US State Department via our Embassy in Washington D.C., including with regard to travel restrictions between our two countries.</p></reply>

The NCCA advises the Department and Minister in relation to the curriculum to be taught in schools.</p>  <p>  The Final Report on the Review of RSE in Primary and Post-primary Schools was published by the NCCA in December, 2019.</p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. Both the primary and post primary SPHE/RSE Development Groups have been meeting virtually on a monthly basis since the groups were convened in October 2020. </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the work is on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of the Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum. This work is progressing well and with sections of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE Junior Cycle Short Course and Senior Cycle SPHE Framework). </p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum as recommended in the NCCA Report has begun, with an initial focus on Junior Cycle. The review of the current Junior Cycle SPHE course has been completed and will be considered by the NCCA Council in June. This review contains a brief which will inform the work of the subject development groups in formulating an updated Junior Cycle SPHE specification, which will begin in September. A draft of the updated Junior Cycle SPHE specification will be available for public consultation in Q1 of 2022.</p>  <p>  Excluding the cost of staff, the NCCA has spent &euro;65,000 on the review of RSE and on the follow-on curriculum-related actions that were set out in the 2019 report. </p>  <p>  Based on the NCCA&rsquo;s  2021 Plan of Work, there will be an additional spend of approximately  &euro;50,000 this year which is related to our ongoing work on the RSE Toolkits and the work on updating Junior Cycle SPHE.</p>  <p>  The current estimated cost for 2022 is approximately &euro;50,000. This will support ongoing work on the Junior Cycle SPHE specification, the online toolkits for primary and post-primary schools, engagement with stakeholders, work with schools, research, consultation, and work with NCCA structures.</p>  <p>  It is more difficult to estimate costs beyond 2022 as work on the new primary SPHE/RSE curriculum and work on senior cycle SPHE/RSE will take place in the context of the wider redevelopment of the primary curriculum and the redevelopments at senior cycle.</p>  <p>  My Department promotes the quality of teaching and learning through the provision of continuing professional development (CPD) and supports for teachers and principals. The majority of this support is provided by the national teacher education support services and by local education centres. The national teacher education support services are the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT), National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT) and the Centre for School Leadership (CSL). Funding provided to the main teacher education support services and education centres for continuous professional development for teachers and Principals in 2020 was &euro;22.454m.</p>  <p>  Given the range of areas and bodies impacted by design and implementation of an updated relationship and sexuality education curriculum across all primary and secondary schools, as well as the difficulty of disaggregating certain cost elements, it is not possible to provide a figure for the overall costs of its introduction in advance of the NCCA review being completed.</p></reply>

Independent evaluation is a central part of the project and the outcome will inform future policy on extending the SIM.  The project includes a number of elements: </p><p>- Provision of in-school therapies (speech and language, occupational) </p><p>- Allocation of SNAs on a frontloaded basis </p><p>- Additional professional supports for the school including psychology, behavioural and professional development </p><p>- Training of SNAs </p><p>In February 2019, the Government approved the trialling of the Model for the 2019/20 school year. Initially designed as a one year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CHO 7 region, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid related work. It was then extended to the 2020/21 school year which has also been interrupted by Covid. </p><p>Progress has been made on aspects of the Model but much remains to be done in terms of in-school implementation and evaluation.  </p><p>As part of the 2021 Budget measures, funding is being made available to extend the School Inclusion Model to two other areas in 2021.</p><p>Planning is underway on the arrangements for the continuation and expansion of SIM and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on the matter as soon as possible.</p><p>A demonstration project to provide in-school and preschool therapy services took place over the course of the 2018/19 school year.</p><p>The project was developed by the Departments of Education, Children and Youth Affairs, Health, and the Health Service Executive and managed and co-ordinated by the National Council for Special Education.</p><p>The purpose of the project was to test a model of tailored therapeutic supports by providing speech and language and occupational therapy within &lsquo;educational settings&rsquo;. This innovative pilot complemented existing HSE funded provision of essential therapy services.  </p><p>The project was evaluated over the course of the 2018/19 school year.

It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  </p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  </p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience</p>  <p>  and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  </p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  </p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. </p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.</p>  <p>  Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. </p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  </p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in our schools and is tailored to their needs.  The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future. There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools. This course is fully funded by the Department of Education. </p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.  This would deal with a number of matters including the identification of need and the provision of appropriate training programmes.</p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p></reply>

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation</p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs</p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools</p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. </p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards</p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act</p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council</p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; </p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. </p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. </p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. </p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. </p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  </p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is: &ldquo;Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act.&rdquo;</p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. </p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p></reply>

url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062300082#WRJ02700"><p>The Fuel Allowance is a household based payment of &euro;28.00 per week for 28 weeks (a total of &euro;784 each year), paid from October to April, to 370,000 low income households, at an estimated cost of &euro;300 million in 2021.  The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;195 million in 2021.  This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year.  </p>  <p>  Taking account of the fact that the fuel allowance is a household based payment and that qualification is not just based on receipt of a qualifying payment but on a number of other complex qualifying criteria such as household composition, it is not possible for my Department to provide an accurate projection of the potential cost of including carer's allowance as a qualifying payment for the allowance.</p>  <p>  The Government values the role of carers very much and it is for this reason that they receive significant income supports from the Department.  In addition to the Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer's Allowance schemes, carers receive further support in the form of free travel and household benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant in respect of each person for whom they care.  In Budget 2021 I was delighted to announce an increase to the Carer's Support Grant by &euro;150 to &euro;1,850.  This will benefit over 130,000 carers.  Carers in receipt of an increase for a qualified child on their claim also benefit from the Budget 2021 increase to the qualified child rate, by &euro;5 in the case of a child aged 12 or over and by &euro;2 for a child aged up to 12.</p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance is a household-based payment, and a Carer will very often live with and be caring for a person in receipt of a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  Income from full rate Carer's Allowance is disregarded from the fuel means test if the carer is providing full time care and attention to the Fuel Allowance applicant, his/her qualified spouse / civil partner or cohabitant or qualified child(ren). </p>  <p>  If a person is getting certain qualifying social welfare payments and also providing full time care and attention to another person, s/he can keep his/her main social protection payment in addition to receiving the half-rate Carer's Allowance.  S/he can also receive an extra half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance if s/he cares for more than one person.  It should also be noted that the payment of half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then s/he is deemed to have satisfied the means test and Fuel Allowance is payable, subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance then s/he will have to satisfy a means test in order to qualify for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  The maximum rates of Carer's Allowance for those aged under 66, at &euro;219 (&euro;257 for carers aged 66 or over) where one person is being cared for, and &euro;328.50 (&euro;385.50 for carers aged 66 or over) where there are two or more carees, is significantly higher than that for most schemes administered by my Department.  </p>  <p>  The means test for Carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings.  At present the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance allows for an income disregard of &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  In the case of a single carer, that person may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, or retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100. </p>  <p>  Carers can also engage in employment, self-employment, training or education courses outside the home for not more than 18.5 hours a week.</p>  <p>  Any proposal to amend the criteria for receiving Fuel Allowance, to include Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as a qualifying payment, would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for

They applied for State pension (contributory) on 28 May 2021.  According to the records of my Department, they have a total of 493 paid full-rate Irish social insurance contributions.  Since their contributions fall short of the requisite 520 paid full-rate contributions, they do not qualify for State pension (contributory) based solely on their Irish social insurance record.  They were notified in writing of this decision on 17 June 2021 and were also advised that their entitlement to a pro-rata pension under EU Regulations has still to be examined. </p>  <p>  Under European Union regulations, the insurance records of EU, EEA and UK can be combined to satisfy the 520 contributions condition and give entitlement to a proportional or pro rata pension. The greater the number of Irish contributions paid by a person, the higher their weekly rate of this pension entitlement.  </p>  <p>  The claimant's UK social insurance record has been requested and they will be notified in writing of the outcome on receipt of the UK record.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The initiative&rsquo;s primary target group when it was established was unemployed people with a previous history of employment. Over recent years the focus was changed to include more people in employment and those returning to the workforce.</p>  <p>  Priority for courses will be given to applicants who are long-term unemployed and to those who have not taken a Springboard+ course before. Applicants who have taken more than three courses in any five-year period, will not be eligible. There is a two year waiting period before they can apply to take a Springboard+ programme again. Further information on eligibility can be found on www.springboardcourses.ie/faq.</p>  <p>  All courses under Springboard+ were selected by an independent panel with experts from industry and education following a competitive tendering process, which is overseen by a process auditor. As there is a limited funding envelope, not all courses can be funded. There was a very strong response from higher education providers this year with almost 800 submissions, an increase of 38% on 2020, and the independent panel noted the particularly high quality of the submissions this year. It should be noted that the call document particularly highlights that, as programmes are evaluated each year based on the application material provided, there should not be an expectation that programmes funded in previous years will automatically receive funding again.</p></reply>

The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013, on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts. </p><p>In 2013, the Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly Mobility Allowance on an interim basis, to those who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the Scheme closed.  Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there are 3,532 people in receipt of the interim payments at March, 2021. </p><p>At the whole of Government level, the <i>National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021</i>sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  Monitoring of the implementation of the <i>Strategy</i>is being overseen by the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which comprises key Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group. </p><p>Under the<i>Strategy</i>,  the Department of Transport, has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport and is committed to the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.  </p><p>Work is ongoing on the policy proposals for the provision of transport supports for people with disabilities.  I intend to revert to Government with proposals in due course.  Recent developments which will impact on the policy options include the following:</p><p>- The ongoing progress by the Department of Transport in providing accessible public transport nationally<i></i>and that Department's public consultation, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport;</p><p>- The <i>Cost of Disability Study </i>currently underway which was commissioned by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as part of Budget 2019.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs;</p><p>- The Working Group established the Strategy by the Department of Justice and Equality to lead a review of all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities; and</p><p>- The review of the Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme by the Department of Finance.</p><p>Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; the Revenue Commissioners Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme; and measures funded under the Department of Rural and Community Development CL&Aacute;R Programme, including &quot;Mobility Care Transport&quot;, to provide grants to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p></reply>

A key focus for Government has been addressing the impacts on the mental health of all our population, including young people. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to mental health was again underlined in Budget 2021 which saw an increase of &euro;50 million, thus bringing total HSE funding for mental health this year to over &euro;1.1 billion. This does not take account of additional funding allocated to mental health in other areas of the health system or through other Departments such as Justice, Education and Social Protection. </p><p>The new funding allocated this year will allow for implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of the widely agreed policy <i>Sharing the Vision</i>. It will, for example, fund over 150 new staff in community mental health services (including 29 posts for CAMHS), bereavement counselling, employment supports and crisis resolution teams. Work is progressing in each of these areas. </p><p>While there is no doubt that Covid-19 has posed significant challenges, including isolation, bereavement, anxiety and loss of income and work for many, we do not yet fully understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health and subsequent demand on services.  I am acutely aware of how difficult the pandemic has been for young people. Developing enhanced supports for them as requirements evolve remains a priority.  Extensive work has been undertaken to date and this will continue. The Department of Health and the Department of Education has, for example, with assistance from the HSE, produced a mental health support leaflet for young people which has been circulated to around 4,000 schools. This was also made available online for download by those working with young people. It signposted a wide range of mental health services, whether those provided direct by the HSE or by agencies on its behalf, for young people and their parents. Details of these, and more, are also available on www.yourmentalhealth.ie. </p><p>I recently had a very positive meeting with Minister Foley and NEPS where we reviewed the range of mental health and psycho-social supports in place for young people and how these might be enhanced. This included guidance counsellors and NEPS in schools, and the well established links for schools to access HSE Primary Care psychology, the specialist CAMHS service, or the many organisations that provide mental health supports for the Executive. </p><p>Since the pandemic started, mental health services have responded rapidly, continuing to deliver supports for young people in the safest possible way throughout the country. The HSE has a range of proactive responses for any rise in mental health service needs, including online and other telehealth psychosocial supports. The HSE Psychosocial Framework, published in January 2021, builds on a range of supports introduced last year in response to Covid. The Framework provides a cohesive, coordinated, consistent and collaborative whole-of-population approach to the provision of mental health services and supports across five key levels, ranging from mental health promotion to specialist supports. </p><p>Digital mental health initiatives were rapidly enhanced to enable services to meet not only current demand, but new and emerging need. It has enabled us to continue providing much needed supports, including digital responses where  traditional face-to-face service delivery was not possible.  </p><p>These include one-to-one counselling and group and peer supports delivered, for example, through MyMind, Turn2Me and Silvercloud. MyMind provides free online counselling, in 15 languages, to people in communities nationwide and is delivering approximately 4,000 counselling and psychotherapy sessions each month.</p><p>Jigsaw, which provides prevention and early intervention services to young people,  has 13 sites nationally and offers online supports to young people in all communities across the country. It will open a new service in Tipperary next month, which will include a blended approach of face to face supports and online services.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Taoiseach announced additional funding for mental health for proposed cross-governmental and inter-agency initiatives to meet evolving demands for mental health arising from Covid,  including those relating to young people. This will cover, for example, promoting positive mental health, increasing awareness of the wide range of supports available, and improving signposting to these service and supports. The Department of Health is at present progressing the details of this new initiative, including consultation with other relevant stakeholders in the health and education sectors.</p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that I, along with the Government as a whole, remain fully committed to enhancing the provision of mental health services and counselling supports for young people nationally, and that I will keep this matter under close review.</p></reply>

The  Panel provided immediate real-time learnings and recommendations in  light of the expected ongoing impact of COVID-19 over the subsequent  12-18 months. The Panel makes a substantial package of recommendations which also reflect that systematic reform in the way  nursing home care, and health and social care for older persons care  more broadly, is delivered and financed. An interagency Implementation Oversight Team and a stakeholder reference group has been established to support the continued implementation of these recommendations.</p>  <p>  While preliminary scoping work  on the establishment of a commission to examine care and supports for older people has commenced, the ongoing priority focus in 2021 is ensuring the continued implementation of the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel. Many of the short and medium term recommendations have already been implemented. </p>  <p>  The  significant examination undertaken by the Expert Panel provides important learning and a framework for enhancing older persons services  both in the short and long-term and this work is progressing. The longer-term strategic reform recommendations of the Panel will  transition into, as needed, specific multi-annual programmes of work  with the necessary governance structures, with some of the  recommendations, as appropriate, given continued examination in the context of a commission. It is currently envisaged that the  scoping work for a such a commission will be significantly progressed  this year in order that it may be established in 2022.</p></reply>

The proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new NMH at Elm Park were set out in the Mulvey Agreement, which was finalised in 2016 following an extensive mediation process between the NMH and the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, published thereafter and noted by Government in 2017. </p>  <p>  The Mulvey Agreement provides for the establishment of a new company - National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC - which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary, independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.</p>  <p>  The draft legal framework subsequently developed is designed to copperfasten these arrangements. It provides that the new hospital remains in State ownership and that thus, the State&rsquo;s significant investment will be protected.  The clear legal advice provided to the State is that the draft legal framework ensures that all legally permissible medical services will be provided in the new hospital.</p>  <p>  However, we will continue to examine all options carefully as we move forward towards finalisation of the arrangements. I have been very clear that I will not bring anything to Government unless it provides assurances around all legally permissible services being provided in the new NMH. In addition, the safeguarding of the State&rsquo;s investment must also be put beyond doubt.</p>  <p>  In that context, I intend to engage further with both St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and the Religious Sisters of Charity over the coming days and weeks.</p></reply>

Next week, Government will give consideration to whether this further easing can proceed as planned. </p>  <p>  While there has been scope to continue with the easing of public health measures, our approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensure that our progress in controlling the virus is maintained. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. To protect the gains of recent months we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours and to follow public health guidelines.</p></reply>

The strategy provides an integrated public health approach to drug and alcohol use, focused on reducing the harms for individuals, families and communities and promoting rehabilitation and recovery.  The strategy is a dynamic strategy and contains 50 actions which are to be delivered over the period 2017-2020.</p>  <p>  Progress reports are prepared on the activity carried out under the 50 actions contained in the action plan.  The 2020 progress report is being finalised and will be released shortly.  Progress and Planned Activity reports for the periods 2018 and 2019 are available.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Department has commenced a mid-term review of the actions in the strategy, in consultation with stakeholders.  The review provides an opportunity to reflect on progress in implementing the strategy to date, progress achieved under the action plan 20217-2020, to identify any new issues that have arisen including the impact of Covid-19 and to consider the development of new actions to address emerging needs and challenges. </p>  <p>  The National Oversight Committee gives leadership and direction to support the strategy. The committee has membership from statutory, voluntary and community sector and is chaired by me as Minister for State. The committee has received regular updates on the mid-term review and a draft report was presented to a special meeting of the committee on 18 June for its consideration.  </p>  <p>  The review when finalised will be brought to Government for approval. Publication of the review will follow soon thereafter.  This will include progress on all the actions in the Strategy, including those referenced by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I am committed to working with all stakeholders to ensure that the national drugs strategy is relevant and appropriate to address the societal challenges arising from the use of drugs, especially for children and young people and for those at greatest risk of harm.</p></reply>

Emergency Support Instrument (ESI) funding has been leveraged by the Commission to facilitate its negotiations with vaccine manufacturers, including with regard to production costs and securing a reduced per dose cost for Member States.</p>  <p>  This process has provided Ireland with access to vaccines (at a reduced cost) that it would find it difficult to access otherwise within a year after the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO. Four of the vaccines in the EU portfolio have already been awarded Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) by the Commission.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports efforts made by the Commission to safeguard the production and delivery of doses of vaccine in the quantities agreed with vaccine suppliers and to ensure that up-front funding provided through ESI has been properly used.</p>  <p>  Covid 19 vaccines can only be approved and used if they comply with all the requirements of quality, safety and efficacy set out in the EU pharmaceutical legislation. No vaccine will be used until Market authorisation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is obtained and any authorised vaccine will be subject to ongoing monitoring in Ireland by the Health Product Regulatory Authority (HPRA).</p>  <p>  The delivery of vaccines under APAs that the Commission has negotiated on behalf of Member States are predicated upon a CMA being obtained from the Commission (on the basis of a positive recommendation being awarded by the EMA).</p>  <p>  The awarding of a CMA provides a high level of assurance that a vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and has met the requirements of the independent regulatory process as regards demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy.</p>  <p>  Ireland has opted into an APA with CureVac and the EMA has started a rolling review of the CureVac COVID-19 Vaccine but it has not been awarded a CMA to date.</p>  <p>  For more information on COVID-19 Vaccines in development, please see the EMA website for more information:</p>  <p>www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/overview/public-health-threats/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/treatments-vaccines-covid-19</p></reply>

Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme at this time. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, will be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. </p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;114 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Those who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations. </p>  <p>  Tax relief is also available on the cost of medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%, and further information is available at www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020. </p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.). </p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness.</p><p>Further details on the updated allocation strategy are available here: </p><p>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/93f8f-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-irelands-vaccination-prioritisation-list/ </p><p>You may wish to note that vaccine registration for those aged 35 to 39 is now open. </p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. You can find more information on the rollout of the vaccine and the progress of vaccinations here: </p><p>www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/rollout/ </p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. People who are vaccinated need to continue with all the public health measures that have been proven to reduce the risk of infection, i.e., limiting our social contacts, physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoiding non-essential travel until a sufficiently large proportion of the population are immune.</p></reply>

It is not possible at this stage to provide a timeframe for this work.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that following an Irish Government decision in January 1975, the Government granted an ex-gratia sum equivalent to 4 times the German lump-sum and an ex-gratia monthly allowance for life equal to the German monthly allowance, to each of the Irish children found to have thalidomide related injuries.  There are currently 29 Irish people in receipt of ex-gratia monthly payments from my Department.</p>  <p>  The German monthly payments are made by the Contergan Foundation, which is established under German legislation.  From 1 August 2013, the Foundation substantially increased its monthly payments to thalidomide survivors, including Irish survivors.  Both the German payments and the Irish ex-gratia payments made to the survivors are exempt from tax, including DIRT and are not reckonable as means for the purpose of Social Welfare payments.  The rate of payment is related to the survivors' level of thalidomide related injury.</p>  <p>  In addition to the initial lump-sum and monthly payments for life, the supports provided to each Irish survivor include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of mean, provision of appliances, artificial limbs, equipment, housing adaptations and access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services.  There is a designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive who liaises with Irish thalidomide survivors and assists them to access supports towards their ongoing health and personal social service needs.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the German Contergan Foundation has confirmed that since 2013 it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the Foundation for assessment of their disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors.</p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.   </p>  <p>  On 28 May, Government decided to move ahead with the process of lifting restrictions further and a range of measures were eased in June. </p>  <p>  The Government has indicated that a further easing of measures will be considered from 5 July subject to the epidemiological situation at the time and this would include permitting confirmations to take place. Government will give consideration to whether this further easing can proceed as planned next week. </p>  <p>  As outlined on Gov.ie, when confirmations are permitted, any related family gatherings should strictly adhere to the prevailing public health advice on household mixing, including visitors to your home and indoor and outdoor dining and any decision to schedule such ceremonies should take account of the disease situation in the local community (www.gov.ie/en/press-release/7894b-post-cabinet-statement-resilience-and-recovery-the-path-ahead/#what-you-can-do-in-july-subject-to-the-public-health-situation-at-the-time). </p>  <p>  While there has been scope to continue with the easing of public health measures, our approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensure that our progress in controlling the virus is maintained. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. To protect the gains of recent months we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours and to follow public health guidelines.</p></reply>

The Department has issued an average of 90-100 licences for the last five weeks and we expect this week to be similar.  This resulted in May being the second highest month in terms of licences issued this year and we expect June to be the highest month of the year so far. The vast majority of licences issued in recent weeks have been to private landowners and farmers. </p>  <p>We remain committed to issuing 4,500 forestry licences this year, which is an increase of 75% on 2020.  To 18 June, 1,594 licences have issued, with 99 licences issued last week.  As outlined previously, there will be weekly fluctuations within individual months.  However we believe that the second half of the year will be higher than the first half for licences issued and that the 4,500 target will be met by year-end. </p></reply>

Improving the licensing situation is a key priority for me, Minister of State Pippa Hackett who has responsibility for forestry and the Department and no effort is being spared to achieve this. We need to maintain an intense focus on achieving this.  Some early progress is being made with licences up 23% year-on-year and I fully expect this figure to increase as the year goes on, accepting that last year was especially low in terms of output.</p>  <p>  Delays in forestry licensing arose because of a very significant change in procedures in relation to Appropriate Assessment as a result of European Court of Justice judgements and subsequent interpretation by the Irish courts and the Forestry Appeals Committee.  Every effort has been made to address this situation with additional inspectorate, ecology and administrative resources recruited, along with training and guidance for both Departmental staff and registered foresters.  </p>  <p>  The complexity of introducing a completely new assessment procedure inevitably took time to take effect and this has affected output. Having said that, there have been recent gains in productivity, with the 1,594 licences issued to date this year representing a 23% increase on the same period last year.  As regards felling, a volume of just over 3.1 million cubic metres has issued so far this year, which is a 58% increase on the same period last year and represents 76% of the COFORD Roundwood Forecast which predicts a potential harvest of 4.1 million cubic metres in 2021. </p>  <p>  While we moving in the right direction, we are more than aware of the impact of the backlog on the sector and, in order to improve the functioning and delivery of the licensing process, Minister Hackett, launched Project Woodland in February. This puts in place a framework consisting of a Project Board and four Working Groups, chaired by independent chairs and with outside stakeholders as members, which aims at resolving the backlog and introducing more efficient and effective processes. The process improvement exercise will examine, among other things, whether resources may be deployed more effectively and an organisational review of  forestry teams within the Department will consider  the structure, roles and responsibilities of these teams relative to outputs sought.</p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, I remain hopeful that the framework now in place under Project Woodland will address our current difficulties and will result in a licensing system which meets the needs of forest owners and new applicants and the forestry sector as a whole.</p></reply>

This amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery.  The mackerel Policy sets down that the hook and line fishery for vessels under 15m in overall length receive 400t.  This allocation for the fishery has been landed, and indeed exceeded and, on that basis, I had no option but to close this fishery.   </p>  <p>  In order to amend Mackerel Policy, I must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect policy, it would require due process involving an assessment of all issues arising, including full public consultation.  </p>  <p>  There has been for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for access to and a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU/U.K. Trade and Co-operation Agreement provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota by 2026 to the U.K.   This will only increase demands for higher shares of Ireland&rsquo;s quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet.  It is worth noting that the 400t for the hook and line fishery has not been reduced.  Unfortunately the situation is that if there is an increase for any sector, such as the hook and line fishery, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the EU/ U.K. TCA.</p></reply>

Working Group 1 is tasked with looking at the backlog. This Group has examined in detail the cases on hand and is producing specific recommendations for improving output. which will be brought to the Project Board for consideration.  Working Group 4 is concentrating on licensing process improvement. A business analyst has commenced work on an end-to-end process review.  In addition, proposals for a pre-application process and a planning grant  are under development  and will be submitted to the Project Board shortly. The Group is also actively considering how best to conduct a regulatory review of the licensing system.</p>  <p>  Communication is another important aspect of Project Woodland and Working Group 3 is working on a new Customer Charter for forestry, and the development of a communication strategy.  A review of the organisational structure of the forestry division within the Department will also be carried out and the roles and interaction with COFORD, Teagasc and Coillte will be examined.</p>  <p>  Working Group 2 is also developing a public engagement strategy as part of the development of the new Forest Strategy. It is envisaged that all stakeholders in the forestry sector as well as the general public will be included in this process, and this should help identify both opportunities and barriers to afforestation.  Furthermore, Irish Rural Link has been commissioned by Minister Hackett to conduct a study to determine the level  and type of engagement of communities with forestry and to make recommendations for the future.</p>  <p>  The Forestry Policy group is meeting later this week at which a full update on progress to date will be provided to all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Minister Hackett's response to the Committee&rsquo;s report also included the Department&rsquo;s position on other issues raised, specifically questions on Ash Dieback disease and Dutch Elm disease. The Department has since presented to the Committee on its plans for licence delivery for the rest of the year and we will continue to engage with the Committee on its implementation.</p></reply>

The Official Veterinarian carries out a health and welfare check on animals, inspects the vehicle, and monitors loading.</p>  <p>  As you will be aware, additional measures are regularly taken to further enhance and safeguard animal welfare during transport, in line with the principles of EU Regulation 1/2005 and further enhanced by national legislation. This includes specific legislation for approval of dedicated livestock carriers and Ro-Ro vessels carrying livestock, setting down standards for the vessel management and the vessel itself. In 2020, additional measures included increased space in lorries for young calves and a requirement on drivers to retrain every three years instead of 10 years. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Programme for Government contains an undertaking to provide additional funding to support animal welfare in the coming years to which I am fully committed. In this regard, in December 2020, I announced record funding of &euro;3.2 million to 101 animal welfare organisations throughout the country.</p></reply>

In addition, the Broadband Connection Point (BCP) Initiative will connect 300 BCPs, many of whom will offer remote working facilities. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is a specific &euro;5m in funding for 2021 within the Town and Village Renewal Scheme to support a Connected Hubs Call, for which applications have recently closed. The regular Town and Village Renewal Scheme has a &euro;15m allocation for 2021. The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund is also providing support for developing remote working facilities, often in the context of wider economic development projects in rural areas. The most recent tranche of successful category 1 projects demonstrates the level of investment and support for access to remote working. Further information can be found at this address: www.assets.gov.ie/132661/55bc580e-e7ab-486c-909a-b20a9b4ce874.pdf.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that since 2016 my Department has invested more than &euro;50 million in the development of remote working facilities through the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.</p>  <p>  In terms of investment in future years, while the review of the National Development Plan is ongoing, the outcome will be important for sustained investment for remote working in rural areas. The programmes that are currently in place in my Department offer differing scales of investment needed to support different rural areas. I intend to ensure this support continues into the future in order to capitalise on the social and economic benefits that remote working can deliver for towns, villages and rural areas across Ireland.</p></reply>
