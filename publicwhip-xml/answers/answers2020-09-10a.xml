For example,  &euro;1.7bn was spent by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on Disability Allowance payments in 2019. Just over &euro;2.054bn has been allocated in the HSE Service Plan for disability-related expenditure this year.  Funding for special education provision in 2020 will amount to &euro;1.9bn which is equivalent to 20% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training.</p>  <p>   In  respect of compliance with the Convention the Government's approach is one of progressive realisation. Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the Convention's requirements. The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 is the mechanism by which the joined-up working to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to implementing the Convention will be delivered. The NDIS Steering Group, which oversees and monitors the implementation of the Strategy, has an important role in guiding progress in this area. The Group recently carried out a mid-term review of the Strategy which examined how the Strategy is aligned with the articles of the Convention and how the Strategy could be revised and built upon in order to continue progressive realisation of the aims of the Convention. Arising from the midterm review, a commitment was made that my Department  will develop an implementation plan, that will include monitoring structures and metrics as appropriate. </p>  <p>  As this is a function that is due to transfer, it will of course be a matter for my colleague, Mr. Roderic O'Gorman, T.D., the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to bring this matter forward.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-10a.12.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091000050#WRA01100"><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to create new pathways for long-term undocumented people and their dependents meeting specified criteria to regularise their status within 18 months of the formation of the Government, bearing in mind European Union and Common Travel Area commitments. Ireland along with other Member States of the EU, has committed, under the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum (2008), to a case-by-case approach as opposed to mass regularisation.  However, the Government recognises that some of our own citizens face similar challenges abroad and is sympathetic to the situation of people who find themselves in an undocumented position through no fault of their own. </p>  <p>  A policy paper on the matter is being drafted by my Department at the present time. This will include an assessment of international best practices. I recently met with the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland to listen to their proposals for undocumented minors and I am also engaging with other key organisations working with migrants including the International Organization for Migration. </p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department established a scheme to regularise the status of non-EEA nationals who held a student permission during the period 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010, that had expired. Over 3,100 applications were received primarily from former students and their family members and over 2,200 applicants were successful in regularising their immigration status. The Scheme concluded on 20 January 2019, and will be considered, alongside other schemes, in any future policy on undocumented migrant children.</p>  <p>  In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. I would encourage any person who is resident in the State without permission to contact my Department or their local immigration office and to take all appropriate steps to regularise their own and their family's status.   </p>  <p>  It is important to say that my Department does not actively seek information from other Government Departments or agencies relating to the immigration status of people with whom they are dealing. We have actively encouraged undocumented migrants to access health care, social supports or assistance from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at any time and especially during the COVID-19 crisis. I want to take this opportunity to repeat that they have nothing to fear from doing so and they should continue to engage with supports where needed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-10a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091000050#WRA01400"><p>The Government is committed to rapidly implementing the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and in that context to introduce the Policing and Community Safety Bill.  Work on the development of the General Scheme of this Bill is at an advanced stage in my Department.  Following consultations with the Garda Commissioner and the oversight bodies, which are underway at present on the detail of the proposals, I hope to bring the matter before Cabinet in the near future. </p><p>I hope the Deputy will appreciate that this consultative process is underway and the question of approval of the detailed approach will be a matter for Government in the normal way. </p><p>However, it may be helpful that I set out the background and the rationale to the proposals that are currently the subject of consultation. </p><p>As the Deputy will recall the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, chaired by Dr Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole and comprising a group of national and international experts drawn from diverse backgrounds, was established by Government to undertake a fundamental examination of all aspects of policing including all functions undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the bodies that have a role in providing oversight - the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, the Garda Ombudsman Commission, my Department and Government. Its 2018 report followed wide-ranging consultations and intensive deliberations. All of its recommendations were accepted by Government which published the 4 year plan &ldquo;A Policing Service for our Future (2019-2022)&rdquo; to support its implementation and under which, I am pleased to say, much has been achieved.</p><p>The Policing and Community Safety Bill is an important element of that plan. It will, as I have said, provide a new coherent governance and oversight framework for policing. This is in response to the Commission&rsquo;s serious finding that the existing framework is complex and confused and acts to the detriment of accountability on the part of individuals and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself. Such a serious finding cannot be ignored. The new framework, as recommended by the Commission, will clearly delineate between the management of the Garda&iacute; and independent external oversight to ensure that all parts of the system have  clear and distinct roles supporting strong internal governance, clear and effective oversight and accountability and ultimately better policing.  <i></i></p><p>Under the new framework responsibility for running the Garda organisation will be situated where it belongs in any organisation - with the head of the organisation, the Garda Commissioner, who will be accountable to a non-executive Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Board in line with best practice. Robust independent oversight will be provided by a new body merging many of the functions of the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate. That body will continue public scrutiny of policing, which the Authority has done to good effect, and will have the added benefit of an in-house empowered inspection function to support its work.  </p><p>As regards the selection and appointments of senior officers currently undertaken by the Policing Authority, the Commission&rsquo;s strong view was that the Garda Commissioner must be empowered to act as CEO of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and be given the levers to run the organisation and drive reform.Responsibility for appointments is clearly within the remit of the Board and CEO of any large organisation and, should the final decision follow this recommendation, in the context of the proposed new governance and oversight framework, it would be appropriate for the Commissioner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Board to be given responsibility for senior appointments. Such responsibility would, of course, need to be subject to the rigorous standards that characterise recruitment to our public services to ensure that the processes are fair and perceived to be so.</p></reply>

On 30 July 2020, I announced that the residents in Cahersiveen would be transferred to permanent accommodation centres, in line with that policy, and that this process would be completed as soon as possible and by no later than the end of the year. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that we have fulfilled that promise and the final transfer of residents from the Skellig Star was completed last week. There are no remaining residents onsite.  </p>  <p>  Residents have been transferred to a number of centres from across our accommodation portfolio, based on an assessment of the most suitable accommodation available to meet their individual or family needs. </p>  <p>  No new residents will be transferred into the Skellig Star following the completion of this relocation process and my Department has no plans to utilise the premises going forward.</p></reply>

This will be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration to take forward following the Transfer of Functions to his Department. </p>  <p>  Currently, all permanent accommodation centres under contract to my Department are subject to three unannounced inspections per year. Twice by officials of the Immigration Service of my Department and once by an independent company (QTS Limited).  Inspections cover a wide range of issues including fire safety and other health and safety issues. </p>  <p>  Any issue identified during an inspection is communicated in writing to the contractor and the contractor is required to address any issue identified immediately.  Officials from the Immigration Service follow up to ensure that relevant issues have been addressed. </p>  <p>  As a result of health and safety restrictions with respect to the COVID-19 crisis, it had not been possible to date to carry out inspections at this time. I am pleased to say that the independent inspector, QTS Limited, has indicated they are in a position to commence inspections within the next two weeks. It is also intended that the inspections team in my Department will re-commence inspections in the coming weeks. All necessary safeguards for inspectors, residents and staff in accommodation centres will be in place to ensure that the welfare and safety of all continue to be protected.</p></reply>

In addition, the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner, in light of identified operational demands. This includes responsibility for the allocation of Garda vehicles.  As Minister, I have no role in these matters.  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of 31 August 2020, there were 3,015 vehicles attached to the Garda Fleet, including vehicles attached to the national units.  For clarity, this figure does not include the additional 210 vehicles which have been hired by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year, to provide additional capacity during the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>  Significant capital investment is being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including a total of &euro;46 million specifically for the Garda fleet between 2016 and 2021. This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  </p>  <p>  Of this investment, a total of &euro;9 million was made available for purchase and fit-out of additional Garda vehicles in 2020.  I am also informed that in order to protect the ongoing availability of vehicles and in anticipation of the impact of public health restrictions on motor factory or fit-out workplaces, 94 additional vehicles were purchased by the Garda authorities in March 2020 at a cost of &euro;2.4m and fit-out costs of &euro;600,000.  The allocation of these and all other vehicles in the fleet is entirely a matter for the Commissioner and his management team.</p></reply>

This will ensure that a coherent process is in place for both the health and non-health aspects required in formalised assessments. </p>  <p>  To assist in determining how best we can meet the health and related needs of applicants, the HSE National Office for Social Inclusion has recently commissioned research to explore the concept of vulnerability with a view to further improving our existing processes and I look forward to the outcome of this research.</p>  <p>  I expect that the Advisory Group on Supports including Accommodation to Persons in the International Protection Process, chaired by Catherine Day will report by the end of this month</p>  <p>  In June 2018, Ireland opted into the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive. This Directive lays down the standards for the reception of international protection applicants. The Directive requires Member States to take into account the specific situation of vulnerable persons and to assess their special reception needs. </p>  <p>  A whole-of-Government approach to the provision of services to applicants for International Protection means that several Government Departments and agencies work closely together to ensure the necessary supports and services are provided to residents accommodated by my Department.</p>  <p>  If a protection applicant chooses to accept an offer of accommodation from my Department, they will, in normal circumstances, be first brought to the National Reception Centre in Balseskin, Dublin. At Balseskin, they will be offered a health assessment by the on-site HSE team, which comprises a nurse, nurse specialist, area medical officer, general practitioners, social worker and psychologist. This ensures that applicants can be assessed for any special reception needs that they may have before they are designated an accommodation centre. </p>  <p>  Safetynet, a primary care health service, carries out health screening, on behalf of the HSE, in a number of the temporary accommodation locations currently in use by the Department. The International Protection Accommodation Service work closely with the HSE screening team and with Safetynet to ensure that protection applicants are moved to locations where their medical needs can be met. We also work collaboratively to ensure that any special accommodation arrangements are in place as required. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made to ensure that residents' specific needs are met. My Department officials routinely identify vulnerabilities and assess applicants for any special reception needs to meet their accommodation requirements. This is especially the case for families with young children and for applicants with a disability. During the COVID pandemic, assessments have also been made for our older residents to ensure that their cocooning needs are met. Where more intensive healthcare needs are required, such cases are referred directly to the HSE.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to introducing, within 12 months, legislation to address those who target victims because of their association with a particular identity characteristic, and to revise and update the Incitement to Hatred Act and I can assure Deputies that my Department is working to prepare this legislation on hate crime and hate speech as a priority. </p>  <p>  As part of this work a comprehensive public consultation has been carried out which included a public survey and an opportunity for stakeholders to make formal submissions. This consultation was conducted to ensure that the Department fully understands the lived experience of those impacted by hate speech and hate crime as well as the views of professionals and other stakeholders in the field. This is necessary to ensure the laws developed are robust, clearly understood and effective in dealing with unacceptable incidents. </p>  <p>  I am pleased with the high level of engagement by the public with this important topic and can inform the Deputy that my Department received in the region of 3,800 written responses to the consultation, including approximately 175 detailed written submissions.</p>  <p>  In addition to this comprehensive consultation and in order to ensure that the final legislation can be that is effective, my Department also carried out comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation.  This research is currently being finalised and I expect to publish it in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  My officials are continuing to analyse all of the materials gathered, as well as other relevant legal and policy information, to ensure that the legislative proposals presented are evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting freedom of expression. There will be a further opportunity for stakeholders to share their views when the legislative proposals on this important issue are published for discussion. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the approach taken to the reform of our legislation in this area - including through the research conducted and providing the opportunity for experts and members of the public to provide their views through consultation - will ensure that the legislation we develop plays a significant part in delivering a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone, now as well as into the future. This is the mission of my Department and as Minister I am fully committed to the combatting racism and prejudice as a key part of this.</p></reply>

This modernisation includes the introduction of a new Family Court Bill and the development of a dedicated family court system.  The development of sensible, comprehensive and sensitive family law procedures particularly for vulnerable families, will be central to the new system.  </p>  <p>  The Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee of the Reform of Family Law System which was published towards the end of last year made almost 40 recommendations across the area of family justice.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the recommendations are extensive and merit a considered and careful response. </p>  <p>  One of the key recommendations of the committee is the establishment of a dedicated and integrated family court within existing court structures. As the Deputy notes, the enactment of legislation on the establishment of a family court is a commitment in the Programme for Government and my Department is currently preparing the general scheme of a Family Court Bill which I will be bringing to Government for approval to draft shortly.  The proposals in this scheme are a result of a broad consideration as to the best means of providing access to various family law mechanisms available to those families involved in private family law cases.</p>  <p>  A Family Justice Oversight Group has recently been established within my Department which, in addition to departmental officials, includes representation from the judiciary, the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Consideration of the recommendations contained in the committee&rsquo;s report will be integrated into the work of that group.</p>  <p>  Pending approval by Government, it would not be appropriate for me to go into too much detail as to the content of the Scheme.  However, I can say that the Family Court Bill will:</p>  <p>  - Streamline family law court processes to make them more efficient and more user-friendly, while encouraging greater use of alternative dispute resolution to assist in more timely settlement of family law cases.</p>  <p>  - Clarify jurisdictional issues so that cases can be dealt with by the most appropriate court notwithstanding the value of assets.</p>  <p>  - Provide for a set of Guiding Principles applicable to all of the parties which could help ensure that the court would operate in a user-friendly and efficient manner.</p></reply>

As Minister for Justice, I have no role in the coordination of this. My Department provides support for the public health regulations by consulting and advising on issues relating to Garda enforcement of the public health measures and through consultation and coordination with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any other relevant agencies. </p>  <p>  Under the recently inserted section 31A of the Health Act 1947, the Minister for Health, when making Covid-19 regulations, specifies which of those regulations are penal provisions.  Non-compliance with a penal provision, or in the first instance, a Garda direction to come into compliance with a penal provision, is an offence.  In making such regulations, the Minister for Health consults with relevant Ministers. Throughout this consultation process, my Department engaged with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to enforcement of those provisions.</p>  <p>  In supporting the public health regulations, the Garda Commissioner and his senior team have implemented a carefully graduated policing response, based on its strong tradition of policing by consent.  Garda members engage, explain and encourage members of the public to comply and, only as a last resort, make use of their enforcement powers under these regulations.  These principles have been central to the policing operation over the last six months.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the policing of these public health restrictions is carried out in an appropriate, proportionate and human rights compliant manner, the Policing Authority were requested to review the policing performance of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to provide reports to myself as Minister.  These reports have been published throughout on my Department's website.  I am glad to note that the Authority has consistently found the performance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be of a consistently high standard in supporting the public health guidelines.  </p>  <p>  In that context, I am informed that under Operation Navigation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has conducted thousands of checks on licensed premises, and continue to find widespread compliance with the public health guidelines. There is, however, a small cohort of premises that are not complying with the public health measures where enforcement becomes necessary.</p></reply>

This is also the case for parents and guardians of children living with them in accommodation provided by the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department. </p>  <p>  Children residing in accommodation centres are educated within the mainstream education system. This means that the children of applicants for International Protection access free primary and post-Primary education in the same manner as the general population.  </p>  <p>  The Roadmap for the Full Return to Schools sets out how the public health advice provided to the Department of Education and Skills on the safe return to school can be implemented at individual school level. The Government approved over &euro;375 million in additional funding necessary to support its implementation. To date, the payments made to schools exceed &euro;160 million. This includes payments for minor works to support school reconfiguration, funding for additional cleaning in schools to support improved hygiene, funding for additional supervision at post primary level to support maintaining of physical distancing as well as significant funding for all schools for appropriate PPE and hand sanitising. </p>  <p>  I can assure you that my officials and all centre staff adhere to local public health advice in relation to children returning to school. </p>  <p>  As recommended by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), a comprehensive programme of COVID-19 testing carried out by the HSE is planned across all accommodation centres housing asylum seekers and refugees in the State for all residents and staff, including children aged 5 years or older.  Testing is voluntary and free and I encourage all residents to avail of the test in order to help protect themselves and their children. However, it is important to say that neither a refusal to participate nor a positive result will affect a person&rsquo;s status or application for international protection in any way.  </p>  <p>  Periodically, some students may be required to self-isolate for a short time on foot of medical advice.  In the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, each accommodation centre was asked to set aside rooms to facilitate self-isolation.  These facilities are still available if required. </p>  <p>  I understand that schools will endeavour to support these students to catch up with their learning on their return to school.  In some instances, where adapted education provision is already being provided by teachers to very high risk students in a school, it may be possible for students who are self-isolating to avail of that adapted provision.</p></reply>

I understand there can be concerns on the part of communities when it comes to the issue of rehabilitation of sex offenders and protection of public safety. </p><p>First it is important to note that there are already provisions in existing law in relation to the management of sex offenders after they have been released from prison.  </p><p>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides that a Court can impose conditions on a convicted sex offender as part of their post-release supervision. Further, where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believe that a convicted offender poses a serious risk to the public, an application can be made to the courts for a Sex Offender Order under s.16 of the 2001 Act.

I can assure Deputies that my Department is working to prepare this legislation on hate crime and hate speech as a priority. </p>  <p>  As part of this work a comprehensive public consultation has been carried out which included a public survey and an opportunity for stakeholders to make formal submissions. This consultation was conducted to ensure that the Department fully understands the lived experience of those impacted by hate speech and hate crime as well as the views of professionals and other stakeholders in the field. This is necessary to ensure the laws developed are robust, clearly understood and effective in dealing with unacceptable incidents. </p>  <p>  I was delighted with the high level of engagement by the public with this topic and can inform the Deputy that my Department received in the region of 3,800 written responses to the consultation, including approximately 175 detailed written submissions.</p>  <p>  In addition to this widespread public consultation and in order to ensure we draft legislation that is effective, my Department carried out comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation.  This research is currently being finalised and I expect it will be published in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  My officials are continuing to analyse all of the materials gathered, as well as other relevant legal and policy information, to ensure that the legislative proposals presented are evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting freedom of expression. There will be a further opportunity for stakeholders to share their views when the legislative proposals on this important issue are published for discussion </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 already prohibits threatening, abusive or insulting conduct that is intended or likely to stir up hatred against a group of persons on account of their sexual orientation, race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, or membership of the travelling community.  In addition, a hate motive may be considered by sentencing judges as an aggravating factor increasing the sentence imposed, where a person has been found guilty of a crime such as assault.   </p>  <p>  I am confident that the approach taken to the reform of our legislation in this area - including through the research conducted and providing the opportunity for experts and members of the public to provide their views through consultation - will ensure that the legislation we develop plays a significant part in delivering a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone, now as well as into the future. This is the mission of my Department and as Minister I am fully committed to the fight against racism and prejudice as a key part of this.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the horrific attacks referred to by the Deputy which happened in separate incidents in both Cork and Dublin last month. These were truly shocking and I condemn the perpetrators of any violent attack. However, as the incidents are the subject of ongoing Garda investigations, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment further, to avoid prejudicing the investigations or any subsequent prosecutions.  </p>  <p>  That said, it is worth noting that work on reforming our legislation in this area is complementary to other cross-Government initiatives to tackle racism in Ireland, including the Migrant Integration Strategy 2017-2020 and the recent establishment of the Anti-Racism Committee. </p>  <p>  The Committee, chaired by Professor Caroline Fennell of UCC, is tasked with reviewing current evidence and practice and making recommendations to Government on how best to strengthen its approach to tackling racism in all its forms, and provide a draft anti-racism strategy, containing a clear action plan within a year.  It is to produce an interim report within three months of first meeting and I look forward to receiving this in due course.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller,and</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006. The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country.</p><p>Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. To date, 29 applications have been approved under the scheme, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;689,000. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, last year the grant aid scheme was extended to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p><p>However in all cases, grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner. </p><p>I am advised by my officials that my Department currently has no applications on hand from the locations referred to by the Deputy. We will of course give immediate attention to applications when they are submitted.</p><p>If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-10a.67.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091000051#WRB02200"><p>I understand the concerns that people have in relation to the purchase for delivery of alcohol products and am very conscious of the detrimental effects of alcohol dependency on families and society. </p>  <p>  In terms of assessing whether a review of legislation is required in relation to the delivery of alcohol, however, it is essential that there is a clear understanding of what the current regulations are under existing legislation. </p>  <p>  There is no dedicated licence for online sales of intoxicating liquor but licensees of licensed premises may engage in online sales subject to certain restrictive conditions.</p>  <p>  As matters stand, under existing legislation where alcohol is purchased online, the same restrictions on the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor apply, including the restrictions in relation to hours of trading and the provisions in relation to the sale and supply of intoxicating liquor to young persons. </p>  <p>  Under section 17(3) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, it is an offence for a licensee, with intent to evade the conditions of the licence, to take intoxicating liquor from the licensed premises for the purpose of its being sold on the account or for the benefit or profit of the licensee, or to permit any other person to do so. The penalty on conviction is a fine of up to &euro;1,500 for a first offence and up to &euro;2,000 for a second or subsequent offence.   </p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, as amended, makes provision for offences relating to the sale and delivery of alcohol products to persons under the age of 18 years. It is an offence under section 31(2) for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol products to any person for consumption off his or her licensed premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission.  On conviction for a first offence, a mandatory closure order of between two and seven days will be imposed by the court, together with a fine of up to &euro;3,000. The penalties for a second or subsequent offence is a closure order of between 7 and 30 days and a fine of up to &euro;5,000. In addition, the licence holder is required to continue to pay staff for the duration of the closure period.</p>  <p>  With technology that facilitates video calls being commonplace in the conduct of business in a broad spectrum of contexts, there do not appear to be any practical impediments to vendors verifying the age of purchasers who purchase alcohol from their homes.   The purchase must be completed from their home in advance of delivery.</p>  <p>  The Government Alcohol Advisory Group considered specific issues relating to 'distance sales' of intoxicating liquor in its 2008 report.  It took the view that sales of alcohol products which have been ordered by telephone or text messaging and which are paid for on delivery do not comply with licensing law requirements and are, therefore, illegal. The Group recommended that the Garda&iacute; target &ldquo;dial-a-can&rdquo; and similar delivery services with a view to prosecuting the offending licensees. Any information concerning transactions of this nature which are contrary to the provisions of the licensing acts should, therefore, be brought to the attention of the Garda&iacute; for investigation and possible prosecution.  </p>  <p>  In conclusion, there is substantial existing legislation to regulate the delivery of alcohol services in Ireland and, as matters currently stand, I do not propose to introduce new legislation in this area.  However, I do appreciate that, with the Covid-19 outbreak, habits of consumers have been affected and the share of purchases online has increased substantially. These changes may be temporary or they may be the beginning of longer term trends. It is perhaps too early to tell what impacts these changes may have and whether increased online sales and delivery of alcohol will, on balance, provide increased convenience and choice to consumers and new revenue streams for small rural pubs or have negative impacts on society that require further regulation.  It is in that context that I remain open to reviewing the situation should compelling objective evidence emerge indicating that a further examination of the legislation regulating these matters is warranted.</p></reply>

Tackling and preventing fraud is of crucial importance to Ireland and to the wider international community. The Deputy may also wish to note that white collar crime is highlighted as an action area in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Combating and preventing fraud and related cybercrime falls under the remit of several Departments and Agencies, and my Department cooperates closely with colleagues across the whole of Government on this issue.   It is vital however, that companies and individuals report any incidents of fraud to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda National Cybercrime Bureau (GNCB) is involved in tackling cyber-enabled crimes in collaboration with other Garda units such as the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  A review of Ireland&rsquo;s anti-fraud and anti-corruption structures, chaired by the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr James Hamilton, is currently examining the effectiveness of the State&rsquo;s procedural, legislative and resourcing frameworks for the investigation, prosecution and prevention of fraud and corruption offences.  I am advised that the Hamilton Review Group is currently finalising the draft report with a view to its publication in the coming weeks.  I look forward to receiving the group&rsquo;s recommendations, which will inform future changes in the State bodies and structures that combat fraud and protect the public.</p>  <p>  With regard to legislative changes, Ireland signed the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Convention on Cybercrime (the Budapest Convention) on the 28 February 2002.  As outlined in the 2nd National Cyber Security Strategy, ratification of the Budapest Convention is aimed to be completed by the second quarter of 2021. The majority of the provisions contained in the Budapest Convention are already provided for in Irish law.  My Department has been working to provide the remaining provisions required to enable ratification. </p>  <p>  With regard to the retrieval of fraudulently obtained funds, these are operational matters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau, and as Minister I have no operational role.  I would note however the existing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and financial institutions with regard to recovering funds.  I note a recent instance where thanks to the prompt action of the business concerned and the relevant financial institution, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were able to recover over &euro;2 million obtained via invoice redirect fraud, in cooperation with international partners. I would echo the advice given by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for all members of the public and all businesses to be wary during this pandemic, and to bring any concerns they have about such fraudulent behaviour to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The CSO produces these statistics using data recorded on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s PULSE system and makes regular releases under reservation in relation to various crime statistics, including recorded and detected crime.  The CSO also continues to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address quality issues in the underlying sources used to compile the statistics.  </p>  <p>   Therefore the official statistics are those which will in due course be published by the CSO.   </p>  <p>  However the Garda authorities have provided my Department with initial, provisional, operational data which shows that : </p>  <p>  - domestic abuse related calls have increased by approximately 24% in the year to date (while reflecting a worrying increase, I should make the point that this figure also reflects increased Garda protective activity and call backs to victims):</p>  <p>  - breaches of Domestic Violence Order Incidents have increased by 10% in comparison to the same time period last year.  </p>  <p>  - Formal notifications to Tusla in the same time period have increased by 18%. </p>  <p>  We have witnessed a rise in the rate of domestic abuse calls recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and incidents during the Covid-19 pandemic and while this is very troubling, it was not unexpected. In view of this, at an early stage in the Covid-19 pandemic, my Department developed an inter-agency action plan to help support those at risk of domestic abuse during the pandemic. The plan which recognises the added risk of domestic abuse which some people face during this period, has been kept under active review and is currently being updated.</p>  <p>  As part of this inter-agency plan and in addition to the funding already allocated for 2020, my Department to date has provided an additional &euro;285,000 to a number of organisations working in the sector, to support and extend the existing services they offer during the period of the Covid-19 pandemic. Other actions under the plan are aimed at ensuring that domestic abuse and sexual violence continue to receive the highest priority from the civil and criminal justice system. This includes priority by the Legal Aid Board and Courts Service for domestic abuse cases and availability of a Legal Aid Board helpline to ensure that persons experiencing domestic violence issues get prompt legal advice and legal representation in court where needed.   </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to attach the highest priority to domestic abuse incidents during the pandemic, including through &lsquo;Operation Faoiseamh&rsquo;, a proactive initiative designed to ensure victims of domestic abuse are supported and protected throughout the period. </p>  <p>  In addition to these actions my Department is also leading a public awareness campaign on domestic abuse during the Covid-19 pandemic, in partnership with frontline services in the community and voluntary sector. This campaign is known as &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo; and it aims to get the message to those experiencing domestic abuse and sexual violence that support services from State agencies and the voluntary sector are still available and accessible to support victims during the Covid-19 pandemic. Further information on the organisations involved in this initiative as well as services and supports for victims is available on the website www.stillhere.ie. </p>  <p>  I also understand that Tusla has put a range of practical supports in place including funding, identification of additional accommodation capacity, and provision of additional ICT resources during the Covid pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that rent supplements are being made available by the Department of Social Protection on a short-term basis to victims of domestic abuse referred via Tusla-funded domestic abuse service providers, with these arrangements to be reviewed after six months of operation. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently leading efforts to identify lessons which can be learned from the inter-agency plan put in place to address domestic abuse, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  This process includes input from the community and voluntary sector working in this area.  The draft Programme for Government contains a commitment to conduct an audit of statutory responsibilities in this area. This audit will be undertaken in conjunction with NGOs and service providers. </p>  <p>  In relation to the questions on services, primary responsibility for funding frontline services including refuges for victims of domestic abuse rests with Tusla.  Tusla has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual or gender based violence, and is providing &euro;25.3 million in funding for these services in 2020.  I have asked that my colleague, Minister O'Gorman, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs address elements in relation to funding frontline services. </p></reply>

To assist in addressing this demand, a new online system for the renewal of Registrations in the Dublin area was developed and launched on 20 July, enabling applicants to safely engage with the Registration Office without the need to attend in person at Burgh Quay.</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the new online renewal system, my Department has received over 22,000 applications from people who would otherwise have had to attend the Registration Office in person. The volume of applications, together with the reduced capacity of the Registration Office due to social distancing requirements, has resulted in longer than anticipated processing times.  However, my officials have already completed approximately 7,000 of these cases.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the difficulties that delays may cause for applicants and it is providing additional resources to the Registration Office to increase its capacity to handle current demand. Where an applicant urgently needs their passport for travel or other such reasons, they should email the Registration Office at burghquayregoffice@justice.ie and set out the circumstances involved.   </p>  <p>  Similarly, it is the case that Irish Embassies and Visa Offices abroad would always have a large number of visa applicants&rsquo; passports on hand, while their visa applications are being processed. Normally if a person requires their passport back while their application is still being processed, they may contact the embassy or visa office that is processing their application to ask for the passport to be released to them. They must then make arrangements for it to be collected, and, if their application is approved, they would send it back to the embassy/visa office to have the visa added.</p>  <p>  A limited resumption of visa services commenced from 22 June 2020. During this initial resumption phase, my Department is only accepting Long Stay &ldquo;D&rdquo; visa applications, including Study, as well as those identified under our current criteria as Emergency/Priority visas.

The National Standards<i></i>apply to the living conditions and services provided to residents within accommodation centres. They apply to all service providers contracted by the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department to operate and manage accommodation and reception centres (also known as contractors). </p><p>The National Standards were developed through an Advisory Group that included representatives from Government Departments, state agencies, UNHCR Ireland and the NGO sector. The Standards are due to come into force in January 2021 and will address a range of themes including accommodation; food and catering; individual, community and family life; health and wellbeing; governance; and meeting the special reception needs of applicants.  These reforms aim to build on the improvements arising from recommendations in the McMahon Report and meet the requirements of the EU Recast Reception Conditions Directive (Directive 2013/33/EU) which we voluntarily opted into in June 2018. </p><p>While my Department currently holds responsibility for the implementation of standards and reception conditions, this responsibility will shortly transfer to my colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration once the Transfer of Functions is completed.</p><p>A White Paper considering the totality of the international protection process, including the provision of accommodation, is due to be published by the end of this year. It will be a matter for Minister O&rsquo;Gorman to decide on how the National Standards will be implemented as part of this process. </p></reply>

All member states were requested to consider whether they supported this proposal and to indicate whether they would opt for permanent summer time or winter time, initially with a 2019 deadline which was later revised to 2021.</p>  <p>  Following a Government decision in October 2018, an Interdepartmental Steering Group was established by the Department of Justice and Equality to oversee a public consultation process and report the findings to Government. The result of this consultation showed that while a majority of respondents were in favour of discontinuing seasonal clock changes, with a preference for remaining at summer time, the overwhelming majority would not be in favour of any change that would result in two time zones on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Discussions with member states on the proposal are ongoing via the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy (TTE) Council.  I share the concern of a number of member states that the proposal may result in a &lsquo;patchwork&rsquo; of time zones across the EU, causing unnecessary confusion and disruption to the single market. I also support the view that a full impact assessment of the proposal should be carried out. </p>  <p>  The Government has made the Commission aware of the difficulties the proposed directive would cause in Ireland if it were to result in two time zones on this island, and we have opposed the introduction of the proposed directive on this basis.</p></reply>

To assist in addressing this demand, a new online system for the renewal of Registrations in the Dublin area was developed and launched on 20 July, enabling applicants to safely engage with the Registration Office without the need to attend in person at Burgh Quay. However</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the new online renewal system, my Department has received over 22,000 applications from people who would otherwise have had to attend the Registration Office in person. The volume of applications, together with the reduced capacity of the Registration Office due to social distancing requirements, has resulted in longer than anticipated processing times.  However, my officials have completed approximately 7,000 cases already.</p>  <p>  I, along with the officials in my Department recognise the difficulties that delays may cause for applicants and are committed to providing additional resources to the Registration Office to increase its capacity to handle current demand.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that there are currently no backlogs associated with first time Stamp 4 registrations which are carried out in person.</p>  <p>  Regarding Citizenship applications, the Deputy may be aware of a challenge taken in the High Court last year by an applicant who was refused a certificate of naturalisation due to his absences from the State during the last year continuous prior to the date of his application. The outcome of this ruling &ndash; which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal &ndash; resulted in significant delays to the processing of naturalisation applications last year.</p>  <p>  In addition, the restrictions attendant to the current COVID-19 pandemic have regrettably resulted in significant challenges to the delivery of normal services. Currently there are approximately 21,000 applications on hand, at various stages within the system, ranging from those just received by the Division to those where a decision has been made but it is not possible to issue an invitation to a ceremony. All applicants 18 years and older must attend at a citizenship ceremony in order to make a declaration of fealty to the State, administered by a Presiding Officer, normally a retired member of the Judiciary. </p>  <p>  As a result of these restrictions, the   Citizenship Division of Immigration Service Delivery is experiencing significant disruption in delivering its core functions. Working within these restrictions, public safety and the wellbeing of staff are of course both urgent priorities.</p>  <p>  The pilot virtual Citizenship Ceremony that took place on 10 July 2020, involved 21 applicants.  As I indicated at that time, a review was underway and consideration of that review is now in its final stages.  </p>  <p>  As I have said previously, a critical consideration is the protection of the welfare and safety of the participants and the general public.  It is also essential that any arrangements put in place ensure that the event is held with an appropriate degree of dignity and solemnity, as befits an event of such importance in the lives of our newest citizens.  At this same time, it is not desirable for extended delays to become a feature of the system, while having regard to the practical aspects of the citizenship process. As a consequence, a critical aspect of the review concerns the ability to provide a scalable solution. The ceremony model will need to be able to meet the requirements of applicants and my Department for an as yet indeterminate period of time.  My intention is to make a decision as to how to proceed shortly. </p>  <p>  It remains my intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow.</p></reply>

Further, the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda estate currently includes 569 Garda Stations. I am further informed that there are no plans to close any of these stations at present.</p>  <p>  Under the Garda Station Rationalisation Programme of 2012 and 2013, one hundred and thirty-nine (139) Garda Stations were closed nationwide.</p>  <p>  This included Kilmihil Garda Station, Clare which was closed on the 31 January 2013 as part of the Garda Station Rationalisation Programme 2013. However, following a further review of stations in the Clare Division, Kilmihil Garda Station reopened on 2 March 2015 and Lissycasey Garda Station was closed in its place.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 2016 contained a commitment to reopen six Garda Stations on a pilot basis. This Programme committed the Government to &ldquo;launch a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda Stations both urban and rural to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  A report was prepared by Assistant Commissioner Special Crime Operations and accepted by the Commissioner, which identified Rush Garda Station, Co. Dublin; Stepaside Garda Station, Co. Dublin; Bawnboy Garda Station, Co. Cavan; Donard Garda Station, Co. Wicklow; Leighlinbridge Garda Station, Co. Carlow; and Ballinspittle Garda Station, Co. Cork as the six stations to be reopened under the Pilot Programme.</p>  <p>  To date, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with the OPW has successfully completed the refurbishment of four of the six Garda Stations to be reopened under the Pilot Programme, i.e. Donard Garda Station, Co. Wicklow; Ballinspittle Garda Station, Co. Cork; Stepaside Garda Station, Co. Dublin; and Rush Garda Station, Co. Dublin.</p>  <p>  There are two Garda Stations remaining which will require refurbishment in order to enable them to reopen as part of the Pilot Programme; Bawnboy, Co. Cavan and Leighlinbridge, Co.

There is also a range of legislative provisions in place for dealing with child welfare particularly regarding the relationship between a child and his/her parents or guardians, providing the framework for a legal response to a wide spectrum of child welfare issues. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on Reform of the Family Law System, which was published late last year, considered the issue of parental alienation among a broad range of issues in the area of family law.

I understand there can be concerns on the part of communities when it comes to the issue of rehabilitation of sex offenders and protection of public safety. </p><p>First it is important to note that there are already provisions in existing law in relation to the management of sex offenders after they have been released from prison.  </p><p>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 provides that a Court can impose conditions on a convicted sex offender as part of their post-release supervision. Further, where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believe that a convicted offender poses a serious risk to the public, an application can be made to the courts for a Sex Offender Order under s.16 of the 2001 Act.  A Sex Offender Order can prohibit the offender from doing anything the Court considers necessary, in order to ensure that the public is protected from serious harm.</p><p>In terms of legislative reform, I can confirm that the General Scheme of the Sex Offenders (Amendment) Bill was developed by my Department following a comprehensive review of current law and administrative practice. The General Scheme was approved by Government<b></b>in June 2018 and it is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The Bill is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. My officials and that Office are working together to finalise the draft with a view to publication of the Bill as soon as possible. </p><p>The purpose of the Bill is to enhance current systems for assessment and management of convicted sex offenders and to put those systems on a statutory footing.  While the drafting process is not yet complete, the main provisions are expected to include:</p><p>- Stricter notification requirements including requiring offenders to notify Garda&iacute; of their address upon release from custody, or any subsequent change of address, within 3 days as opposed to the existing 7 days.</p><p>- Provision to allow for fingerprinting and photographing the offender, where necessary to confirm their identity.</p><p>- Enhanced supervision of high-risk offenders, including, in limited circumstances, the electronic monitoring of offenders subject to post-release supervision orders.</p><p>- The placing on a legislative footing of assessment teams to assess and manage the risk posed by sex offenders.</p><p>- Provisions whereby a court can prohibit a sex offender from working with children.</p><p>- Provision for a statutory basis for the necessary disclosure of information relating to a high-risk offender on the &lsquo;sex offenders register&rsquo;. The information in relation to an offender which may be disclosed include the name, address and threat posed by the offender. It is intended that the disclosure would only be made to the minimum number of people necessary to avert a serious risk to safety.</p></reply>

This opinion is shared by my colleagues across Government, and our commitment to implementation is reflected in the new Programme for Government - Our Shared Future.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in September 2018, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland published its final report,outlining a clear vision and roadmap for strengthening An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the broader national framework for policing, security and community safety.</p><p>There is already an extensive implementation framework in place with respect to CoFPI.  In December 2018, Government published A Policing Service for our Future &ndash;the 4-year Plan (2019-2022) to implement the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. The Plan was developed in cooperation with stakeholders from across the public service, in particular, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The Policing Reform Implementation Programme Office (PRIPO) &ndash; which is based in the Department of the Taoiseach &ndash; monitors progress on the actions contained in APSFF, supporting the work of the Implementation Group on Policing Reform (IGPR), and keeping the High Level Steering Board on Policing Reform and Government apprised of the progress being made. </p><p>In 2020, the third phase of the implementation of APSFF &ndash; the Scaling Phase &ndash; is scheduled to commence. This is the critical phase of the programme of reform, during which the programme gains momentum. The delivery of the majority of the actions will be started or executed during the Scaling Phase. The Scaling Phase builds on the progress achieved under the Building Blocks and Launchingphases which set and implemented the foundations for the success of the Plan.</p><p>Progress in 2020 has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I have been encouraged to see the responsiveness and flexibility shown by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with the demands of this unprecedented situation. IGPR is continuing to work with key stakeholders to identify priority actions for implementation and is actively engaged in ensuring continued momentum on the key reforms in so far as possible under the current circumstances.</p><p>That being said, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that much has already been achieved under APSFF.For example, the roll-out of a new Operating Model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has commenced. This model is designed to streamline Garda administration and to provide a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide.</p><p>In 2019, approximately 600 new Garda recruits attested and were assigned to frontline policing duties nationwide. In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recruited almost 750 Garda Staff. This has allowed approximately 600 Garda&iacute; to be reassigned from administrative to frontline operational policing duties where their training and expertise can be used to best effect. </p><p>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2019 has been enacted which gives Garda&iacute; access to the Workplace Relations Commission for the first time and provides for a modern industrial relations framework within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established and strengthened resourcing of a Human Rights Unit and re-established the Strategic Human Rights Advisory Committee. Also, the National Security Analysis Centre (NSAC) has been established, and the Director of NSAC has been appointed;</p><p>Furthermore, there is ongoing progress on legislative reform. For example, the Government hasgiven approval for legislation to be drafted to underpin the use of recording devices (including body worn cameras) and for the codification of legislation defining police powers of arrest, search and detention. </p><p>Work is also well advanced on the development of the General Scheme of the Policing and Community Safety Bill to give legislative effect to the recommendations of the CoFPI Report.  It will redefine policing to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable and place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the broader issue of community safety. It will provide for a new coherent governance and oversight framework to empower the Garda Commissioner to act as CEO supported and held to account by a non-executive Board, while ensuring both strong internal governance and robust, transparent external oversight as well as effective accountability which will ultimately lead to a better run organisation and more effective policing.  Following consultations with the Garda Commissioner and the oversight bodies which are underway at present on the detail of the proposals, I hope to bring the matter before Cabinet in the near future.</p><p>These measures and achievements represent only some of the wide range of actions being progressed under APSFF.

The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups.  Its work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. It also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners.  </p>   <p>The Deputy will be familiar with the National Drugs Strategy, "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025  ".  The Strategy is unique among national drugs strategies across EU Member States in recognising the need to address drug-related debt intimidation at a community level. </p>  <p>  The Strategy includes an action (4.1.42) which specifically relates to strengthening the effectiveness of the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme. The programme, which was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in partnership with the National Family Support Network (NFSN) to respond to the needs of drug users and family members who may be subject to the threat of drug related intimidation, has been implemented on a national level since 2013.</p>  <p>  Funding for the programme is provided by the Department of Health via the Family Support Networks / Drugs Task Forces. My Department continues to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Department of Health in relation to public information about the programme. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regard drug-related intimidation as a hugely serious issue which impacts significantly on communities throughout Ireland. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na advise people to seek help and support from their local Garda&iacute; even where a person has felt compelled to pay money to those who engage in drug related intimidation.</p>  <p>  Cases are dealt with in a confidential and secure manner and, insofar as is possible, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides practical personal security and safety information and advice in relation to particular threats or instances of intimidation, along with information on appropriate drug support services for any member of a family who is accruing drug debts, while also providing information regarding the process involved in making a formal complaint relating to alleged intimidation. </p>  <p>  In line with the Strategy, the GNDOCB has briefed senior Garda managers throughout the country in relation to the most effective handling of suspected incidents of drug-related intimidation and, in particular, the potential role of the programme in this regard.</p>  <p>  Seminars are delivered by the GNDOCB and the NFSN to the Garda Inspectors assigned in each division to ensure appropriate implementation of the programme. Attendees at these seminars also include members of Drugs &amp;amp; Alcohol Task Forces as well as Garda&iacute; in local drugs units.  </p>  <p>  Awareness of the programme is also promoted to all Garda&iacute; and regional management through the GNDOCB and - with the assistance of the NFSN, relevant agencies, Regional and Local Drug &amp;amp; Alcohol Task Forces and community groups - in communities throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Information in relation to the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme and a list of the nominated Inspectors countrywide is available on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Website, www.garda.ie, the National Family Support Network website and the www.Drugs.ie website.</p></reply>

The announced inspection was to facilitate a research project by public health, DAFM and HSA in a particular plant.</p><p>The general policy of the HSA for workplace inspections is that all inspections should be unannounced, however, there can be circumstances where this is not possible. Such circumstances could include the need to speak to a specific person in a workplace or attend a workplace with an external expert and the inspector may need to give advance notice. Furthermore, some inspections might require an audit type approach to best assess the safety management system in place and arrangements to meet with the appropriate responsible persons onsite will require announced inspection.</p><p>In relation to the inspection of meat plants the Health and Safety Authority is supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) which has a permanent presence at 49 of the 149 DAFM approved meat premises and which carries out inspections related to the national Return to Work Safely Protocol under an MOU with the Health and Safety Authority.</p></reply>

I know that employers, employees and the self-employed in this sector want to get back to work as quickly as possible and I support them in that ambition.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, in recent weeks there have been multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 across workplaces, households and in sports clubs with the result that it has not yet been  possible for the  Government to relax the restrictions on the number of people who may gather at indoor events. Instead, the Government, in light of public health advice,  agreed to put in place a number of measures until September 13 in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. Such action was necessary to protect the vulnerable in our communities, enable schools to reopen and support the resumption of health services.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the July Stimulus package was introduced to help businesses to open, to help those that are already open to stay open, to get staff back to work and for those who cannot go back to their old jobs, there are new opportunities. These new measures are in addition to those already announced since the onset of the Global Pandemic.  Significantly to support viable businesses and jobs, including new hires, we have extended the wage subsidy scheme, which run until the end of March 2021 and will be open to firms that do not currently participate and open to workers like seasonal workers who were not previously included. We are also giving companies extra assistance to reopen and stay open through an enhanced Restart grant available to more firms and more generous. We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. We have also announced a six month reduction in the VAT, going down from 23% to 21%, together with a range of additional measures designed to stimulate domestic demand.  Businesses affected by Covid-19 will able e to delay payment of their PAYE and VAT debts in part of in full for a set period with no interest or penalties</p>  <p>  Further information on these, along with the full list of actions within the July Stimulus and how to avail of them, can be found at www.gov.ie/jobsstimulus.</p>  <p>  Representatives of the trade fair and events industry have submitted proposals to my colleague Minister of State Troy which outline how trade fairs and exhibitions could be conducted safely. These proposals have been shared with the Minister for Health and will be considered by the Government in the context of lifting restrictions into the future, as we seek to balance public health, economic and social aspects of living with COVID-19 in the short to medium term and try to bring some greater certainty so that society and business can plan forward.</p></reply>

In 2020, an additional &euro;10m exchequer funding was provided for broadcasting of which RT&Eacute; will receive &euro;9.3m. TG4 was allocated current expenditure of &euro;34.233m and capital expenditure of &euro;3m in 2020.

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. According to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s latest projections published earlier this year, our 2020 emissions could be 2 to 4% below 2005 levels, and we will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Covid-19 will undoubtedly impact our 2020 emissions, and this is not reflected in these projections.   Pre-Covid estimates of the additional costs of this compliance requirement were in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of credits required. The Department is currently in discussion with the NTMA in relation to purchasing additional carbon credits from the market to make up this expected shortfall.</p>  <p>  The EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. This represented a 12.9% increase on Ireland's reference starting point of 3.1% in 2005, and is the third highest increase assigned to any of the 28 Member States of the European Union. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to achieving this target and while good progress has been made to date it is accepted that Ireland will not meet the 16% target and the projected overall shortfall is between 1.7 and 3.7 percentage points by end 2020. It should be noted that reduced energy demand in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 may mean that this shortfall is slightly lower. Contingency planning has also commenced to explore the potential extent, mechanisms and cost of addressing our renewable energy 2020 target through statistical transfers with other Member States within the framework of the Renewable Energy Directive.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out our commitment to further increase our ambition, and halve our national carbon emissions over the course of the coming decade. As Minister for Climate Action, I will lead on delivering our shared commitment to achieve an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The 2050 target will be set in law in the Climate Action Bill, which I will introduce in the D&aacute;il within the first 100 days of government.</p></reply>

This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The current deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p>  <p>  Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 20 counties and steady progress is being made with over 89,000 premises surveyed to date. This survey work is feeding into detailed designs for each deployment area and laying fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year. While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible.</p>  <p>  The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.  </p></reply>

I would like to thank both public and commercial operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times. A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services during the pandemic, including enhanced cleaning regimes and social distancing measures across the network. </p><p>Over the course of the COVID-19 crisis, my Department has been working closely with the National Transport Authority (NTA) to ensure public transport services continue and to plan for the provision of enhanced public transport services in line with the Government Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. In this context, the NTA is engaging directly with both PSO and commercial transport operators.  </p><p>With the commencement of Phase 3 of the <i>Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business</i>on 29 June 2020, changes to the existing public transport social distancing restrictions were agreed, allowing a move from 2 metres social distancing to utilising 50% of the passenger-carrying capacity of fleet. This will help to underpin public transport services during these unprecedented times, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity.  Alongside this change, it was also decided that the wearing of a face covering when using public transport would be made mandatory.  The Regulations for the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport were introduced under Health legislation on 10 July and came into effect on Monday 13 July. Public health advice tells us that face coverings are an important safety measure, especially in interior spaces, but that they are not suitable for every individual, particularly those who cannot do so for health reasons or due to young age. </p><p>Further, there is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and therefore should only be used for essential travel, with only those who absolutely have to travel at peak times doing so and encouraging staggered retail and office opening hours. People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical, and organisations are encouraged to continue to facilitate working from home.</p><p>As part of new restrictions announced by Government on the 18th August, people have been asked to avoid public transport where possible. This advice along with other measures (such as continuing to work from home where possible) is aimed at suppressing the spread of Covid-19 in Ireland. The advice is also aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, including frontline workers and students.</p><p>The new measures were introduced following recommendations made to Government by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).</p></reply>

The tax credit is worth a maximum of &euro;125, or &euro;250 for a jointly assessed couple. </p>  <p>  The scheme is a tax-based measure administered by Revenue and is one of a number of initiatives introduced by the Government as part of the July Stimulus Package with the aim of supporting employment.</p>  <p>  It is the case that those on low incomes who have been removed from the tax system through Budgetary policy over the years, and therefore pay no income tax or USC, will not be in a position to benefit from this initiative. </p>  <p>  Within the tax system, the normal position is that a tax credit can only benefit a person who has an income tax liability. In the present instance, however, special arrangements have being made to extend the potential benefit as widely as possible so that, even where a person does not have an income tax liability, he or she may still benefit by virtue of having a USC liability.</p>  <p>  In terms of those on lower incomes, the position is that a full-time minimum wage worker will be able to absorb fully the Stay and Spend Tax Credit in either 2020 or 2021.   </p>  <p>  Indeed a person who earns 75% of the minimum wage in the year, for example a person working part-time for just over 29 hours per week on the minimum wage, will also be able to fully absorb the credit in either 2020 or 2021. In this case, the person will not have an income tax liability, but, by virtue of the fact that the tax credit may be set against a USC liability, the person will be able to fully benefit.</p>  <p>  The credit will be off-set against the claimant&rsquo;s income tax liability in the year of assessment, after other allowances, deductions or reliefs have been given to the claimant. If the credit available to a claimant is higher than their income tax liability in the year of assessment, any excess credit may be off-set against their liability to USC in that same year. This credit can be used to reduce a claimant&rsquo;s liability to income tax and USC in the year of assessment to nil.</p></reply>

In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation in April 2015. </p><p>The number of samples of Marked Gas Oil drawn and the consequential detections of misused fuel for the period 2018 through 31 August 2020 are set out below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Samples Drawn</th>       <th>Misuse Detections</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>27,875</td>       <td>835</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>33,984</td>       <td>867</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 (to 31 August 2020)</td>       <td>6,843</td>       <td>215</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition, Revenue conducted random National Sampling Programmes in the years 2016 to 2019 to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The programmes involved nearly one in ten of some 2,500 holders of auto fuel trader licences. Tests of diesel samples taken from the randomly selected traders found no evidence of the marker in any of them. The results of this sampling are a clear indication that Revenue&rsquo;s actions have resulted in the near elimination of the selling of laundered products at retail level. The 2018 sampling programme was expanded to include hauliers and other businesses in the transport sector. A very small number of samples from this programme tested positive. The results of the 2019 sampling programme were broadly in line with previous years. The 2020 programme analysis has yet to be completed. </p><p>The results represent confirmation of the effectiveness of the various measures introduced by Revenue in recent years to enhance compliance in the fuel trade and among users of diesel. The random sampling programme results do not signify the complete elimination of the illicit trade in fuel. However, they do demonstrate that systematic selling of illicit fuel through retail outlets and its use in the transport sector is negligible. </p><p>Despite the success in combatting the misuse of fuel I am assured by Revenue that combatting such criminality continues to be a priority. Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against cross-border fuel crime and also co-operate with their counterparts in Northern Ireland under the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups who operate across jurisdictions and are responsible for much of this criminality.</p></reply>

Retirement ages in the public service are provided for in primary legislation and summary details are set out in the following paragraphs and in tabular form below.  Retirement arrangements in the private sector are a matter for the individual employer and employee.  </p><p>- Minimum pension age is the earliest age at which a public servant may retire and receive their pension benefits without actuarial reduction.  Most public servants have a minimum pension age of 60, 65 or the age of eligibility for the State Pension (currently 66), depending on their date of recruitment, as set out in the table below.</p><p>- Public servants who wish to retire before reaching minimum pension age may avail of &ldquo;cost neutral early retirement&rdquo; (CNER) from age 50 or 55, as set out in the table below.  This means that they can retire at age 50 or 55 with immediate payment of pension benefits but their pension and lump sum are actuarially reduced to take account of the earlier payment. </p><p>- Compulsory retirement age is the age at which a public servant must retire.  Most public servants recruited between 1 April 2004 and 31 December 2012 have no compulsory retirement age.  Most other public servants have a compulsory retirement age of 70, as set out in the table below.  Public servants are not obliged to remain in employment until they reach their compulsory retirement age.</p><p>The only significant exception to the retirement conditions outlined above relates to the group of employees in the public service who, due to the nature of their work, are required to retire early.  This group is made up of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of the Permanent Defence Force, Firefighters and Prison Officers.  Members of these groups have lower minimum pension ages and lower compulsory retirement ages than other public servants.  Details for these groups are not included in the table below.</p><p>Retirement ages in the public service have been reviewed as recently as 2017.  I have no plans at present to undertake a further review in this area.</p><p><i>Table</i></p><p><i>Retirement Ages in the Public Service</i> <table>    <tr>       <th>Recruitment Date</th>       <th>Relevant Legislation</th>       <th>Age eligible for CNER</th>       <th>Minimum Pension Age</th>       <th>Compulsory Retirement Age</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pre 1 April 2004</td>       <td>Public Service Superannuation   (Age of Retirement) Act 2018</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>70</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 April 2004 to 31 Dec 2012</td>       <td>Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004</td>       <td>55</td>       <td>65</td>       <td>None</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>On or after 1 Jan 2013</td>       <td>Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012</td>       <td>55</td>       <td>Consistent with State Pension Age (currently 66)</td>       <td>70</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The minimum reckonable income for eligibility under the scheme is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with the detailed provisions of the Ministerial Direction issued under Sections 24(3) and (4) of the 2014 Act. In the determination of the minimum reckonable income, local authorities can include income from a number of different sources and classes, such as from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments, including pensions, where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  In determining reckonable income, the income of all tenants of the house, including adult children that are joint tenants, is included, as is the income of the spouse, civil partner or other partner/co-habitant of a tenant who lives in the house with them, thus ensuring the appropriate level of discount is applied to the purchase price.</p>  <p>  The minimum income criterion was introduced in order to ensuring the sustainability of the scheme.  Applicants must demonstrate that they have an income that is long-term and sustainable in nature. This ensures that the tenant purchasing the house is in a financial position, as the owner, to maintain and insure the property for the duration of the charged period, in compliance with the conditions of the order transferring the ownership of, and responsibility for, the house from the local authority to the tenant.</p>  <p>  The financing of any house sold under the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme is a separate matter from the eligibility criteria for the scheme.  If the tenant is deemed eligible under the scheme, he or she may fund the purchase of a house from one, or a combination, of his / her own resources or a mortgage provided by a financial institution or a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  A review of the first 12 months of the Scheme&rsquo;s operation has been undertaken. In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda. I expect to be in a position to publish the review and finalise changes to the Scheme once the work on these reform measures is complete.</p></reply>

The measure applies across the public service, including the Defence Forces. However, it does not apply in relation to employment with the commercial state bodies or where public service pensioners are employed outside the public service.  </p><p>Pension abatement operates to ensure that pensions payable to public servants do not have the effect of making a pensioner's earnings from their current public service job, plus their existing public service retirement pension, exceed the current equivalent of pensionable salary from their old public service job. The pension payable is reduced as appropriate, that is, abated, to stay within the overall limit. However, the actual impact (if any) from the measure on a person&rsquo;s public service pension will vary from person to person and in some cases there may be no abatement.  </p><p>I should point out that prior to 1 November 2012, this abatement measure already operated as a standard feature of public service pension schemes generally.  However, this was only within individual sectors and bodies where a public service pensioner resumed working in his or her former occupation, e.g. a soldier rejoining the Defence Forces, a civil servant rejoining the Civil Service etc. The 2012 Act extends the measure across and between all public service sectors generally, thereby restoring the arrangements that were in place until 1965.</p><p>I should also state that a public service pensioner already in public service employment<b></b>immediately before 1 November 2012 is not affected by the change while he or she remains in that post or position. However, if their employment status changes after that date, for example, where they secure a new post through promotion with their current public service employer or where they move to a different post or public service body on transfer or promotion, their pension is subject to abatement in accordance with the legislation. </p><p>The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012 comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the question of any changes to that Act would therefore be a matter for him in the first instance.</p></reply>

The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. Funding has been provided to private transport providers who are contracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department to operate the School Transport Scheme services in order to meet these requirements. </p>  <p>Updated health advice was received from NPHET on 18 August, which impacts on the operation of post-primary school transport services.  This advice stated that for secondary school students on school transport, strict distancing should be ensured in line with that on public transport along with the wearing of face coverings. </p>  <p>  The Department is engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of these plans, in order to implement measures so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50% capacity will do so and over the coming period all other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing. </p>  <p>  Commercial contractors who provide transport for schools on a private hire or commercial basis but who are not contracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann to operate on the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme do not fall under the remit of the Department of Education.

The sourcing agreement also includes 4 suppliers who can meet the needs of the schools for alcohol free solutions where the need arises. </p><p>The arrangement allows each school to select the products that meet their specific requirements from suppliers who have been ranked through a stringent evaluation process to ensure they meet the best in quality and delivery timelines. This allows schools to make a local decision within the framework to get the highest standard of PPE available from the market place at the best price from the preferred supplier for a particular school within the value for money and safety standards of the framework.&rdquo;</p><p>An information pack has been emailed directly to all schools, including a User Guide, which sets out the steps schools should follow when purchasing goods from suppliers under the Supply Arrangement. Further guidance documents for Primary School/Special Schools and Post Primary School on on PPE, Consumables and Equipment was also published on the www.gov.ie/backtoschools on August 7th 2020.  This included guidance to schools in identifying the potential volumes of PPE and consumables which they may require in line with their COVID-19 Response Plan.</p><p>More than &euro;30 million of capitation supports has been made available to primary and post primary schools to fund its PPE/Hand Sanitiser requirements up to the end of the year.</p><p>This capitation grant rate up to the end of 2020, reflects the fact that there are a number of once off type costs which schools face in implementing COVID-19 Response Plans (i.e. installation of sanitiser units, signage/posters etc.) which will be incurred upfront.  The COVID-19 Capitation Grant for 2021 up to the remainder of the school year, will be confirmed in December following review/monitor of usage in schools in the period up to the end of the year.  It is important to note that the COVID-19 Capitation Grant is specifically provided to support schools in minimising the risk of spread of infection of COVID-19. This COVID-19 Capitation Grant for PPE, Consumables and Equipment is ring-fenced funding provided to schools for the purchase of appropriate PPE, consumables and equipment required by schools in minimising the risk of spread of infection of COVID-19 in line with the Roadmap, public health advice, Return to Work Safely Protocol and their COVID-19 Response Plan and should only be used for that purpose. This includes PPE and consumables which may have been purchased by schools from sources outside of the Supply Arrangement established by the Department</p><p>By way of context in advance of school&rsquo;s reopening, over 4,500 deliveries of PPE orders were made to schools over a 2 week period by suppliers under the Multi-Supplier arrangements.  A small number of schools have highlighted difficulties directly to the Department through the reopening school helpline of delayed deliveries or products not meeting their expectations in a very small number of cases. Such matters are raised directly with the suppliers in question to ensure such concerns are addressed in the continued provision of PPE/hand sanitiser directly to schools on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

While clear guidance was provided to schools during the process of estimating marks for their students, it is inevitable that some schools will have been overly harsh in their estimations while others will have been overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated percentage mark. </p><p>The standardisation process seeks to bring schools into line with each other across a national standard. This results in some estimated marks being reduced while others will have increased. </p><p>The Leaving Certificate results from any one year are considered equivalent to the results from any other year. In the Leaving Certificate examinations, standardisation is implemented though the script marking process. This year, the national standardisation process combines the school estimates and other data to ensure the Calculated Grades reflect standards that are properly aligned across schools.  </p><p>On 1 September, I announced details in relation to the Calculated Grades model following approval of proposals made to Government. The change proposed removed the use of school-by-school historical data in the standardisation model.</p><p>The change made placed a greater emphasis on the estimated marks provided by schools to individual students. The process, through the examination and adjustment of estimated percentage marks from schools, still fulfilled its key role of ensuring that the calculated grades iron out the unfairness that could arise when different schools applied various standards when judging the performance of students.</p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the results and are available .  To issue the technical detail of the modelling process in advance of the release of grades would risk detracting from the core principle of providing the most fair and equitable set of results for each candidate.</p></reply>

Late applicants and/or families who pay late are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2020/2021 school year.</p><p>In addition, payments for Post-Primary seats completed or made after 4<sup>th</sup>August 2020 can only be considered when 50% capacity, required by new Covid19 public health guidelines, is achieved on each route.</p><p>In the event of not securing a ticket where no capacity exists, or on cancellation, a full refund will be issued.</p></reply>

Supports towards the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items may take longer as it is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes becomes known.  The longer term supports can cover remedial works such as plastering, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring and painting and it can take several months before this stage of the response is completed.</p>  <p>  The scheme is available to provide support to householders following the recent flooding events in West Cork.  The Community Welfare Service has been engaging with a small number of households that have sought assistance. </p>  <p>  If any homeowner affected by the recent flooding needs to access these supports, they should make contact with the Community Welfare Service at 028-21047 or corkswa2020@welfare.ie.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

According to the records of my Department, they have a total of 260 paid full-rate Irish social insurance contributions.  They had not provided details of employment in any other country.  Since their contributions fell short of the requisite 520 paid full-rate contributions, they did not qualify for standard State pension (contributory) based on their Irish social insurance record. They were notified in writing of this decision on 19 August 2019. </p>  <p>  Under European Union regulations, the insurance records of other Member States can be combined to satisfy the 520-contribution condition and give entitlement to a proportional or pro rata pension.  The person re-applied for State pension (contributory) on 20 September 2019 and provided details of employment in Poland.  </p>  <p>  The person advised that they had also applied for State pension (non-contributory) and wished to be paid whichever pension would be more financially beneficial to them. On 5 November 2019, the person concerned notified my Department that they no longer wished to proceed with their application for State pension (non-contributory).  The Deciding Officer issued a letter to them on 7 November 2019 confirming that their application had been withdrawn.  On 15 January 2020, the person concerned re-applied for State pension non-contributory, which was awarded with effect from 17 January 2020, in accordance with legislation.  They were notified of this decision on 9 March 2020 and afforded right of appeal. </p>  <p>  The person&rsquo;s Irish and Polish social insurance contributions were combined to establish their entitlement to an EU pro rata State pension (contributory).  They have 1,122 contributions and credits, composed of 260 Irish paid full-rate contributions, 9 Irish credited contributions, and 853 EU contributions.</p>  <p>  The person concerned qualified for an EU pro rata State pension (contributory) at the current weekly rate of &euro;50.70.  However, since they were in receipt of a higher rate of State pension (non-contributory), their State pension (contributory) claim was withdrawn as both cannot be paid concurrently.  They were notified in writing of this decision on 17 August 2020.  </p>  <p>  There are no arrears of State pension (contributory) due as Supplementary Welfare Allowance was in payment prior to award of State pension (non-contributory). </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This year, the Department received over fifty detailed submissions from the organisations attending, as well as from those who were unable to attend on the day. </p>  <p>  The submissions raised issues and outlined priorities across a broad range of areas which affect pensioners, lone parents, people with disabilities, carers, jobseekers and more.

The proposed defined benefit pension provisions were of a very technical nature and involved complex policy and legal issues.  In an effort to achieve a resilient solution, extensive consultation were undertaken with, and numerous legal advices were obtained from, the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of this policy.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Bill lapsed with the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and Seanad in January 2020.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;, commits to progressing a number of pension related matters as a priority.  Officials in my Department are actively working to draft legislation to set out how the planned increase in the State pension age next year will be deferred and it will remain at 66 years pending the report of the Commission on Pensions which the Government is establishing.   </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also proposes an &ldquo;Early Retirement Allowance or Pension&rdquo; for 65 year olds paid at the same rate as Jobseekers Benefit without a requirement to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.  The new payment will be introduced as early as possible for those who are retired from employment.  Officials in my Department are currently considering the design of the scheme and assessing the necessary legislation, ICT system requirements and administrative processes required for the introduction of this payment.   </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Pensions Authority, is also continuing to actively monitor the defined benefit regulatory regime to ensure it appropriately balances fairness between all generations of scheme members with the need to help sponsoring employers, employees and scheme trustees maintain the sustainability of their pension schemes.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, a number of changes were introduced to the eligibility criteria for CE in 2017 to broaden access to the CE programme to a greater number of people on the Live Register and to standardise the conditions around the length of time a person can remain on a scheme.</p>  <p>  In general, participation in CE for those aged between 21 and 55 years is for 1 year. Where a CE participant is working towards a QQI major award or working towards a recognised industry standard, their time on CE may be extended by up 2 years to complete this training. In addition, those over 55 years of age can remain on CE for 3 years. </p>  <p>  An overall lifetime limit of 6 years applies to all CE participants (7 years for those from a disability payment). A person may re-qualify for CE after 12 months of being in receipt of a qualifying payment, provided they have not reached their lifetime limit. </p>  <p>  Placements on CE are temporary and are subject to time limits to safeguard the availability of opportunities for employment on CE schemes for other candidates.  I am mindful of ensuring that there is capacity on the CE scheme, within the financial allocation available to my Department, to enable other long-term jobseekers access to the work experience and training opportunities available through CE.  Unfortunately, this is particularly relevant in the current environment with the rise in Live Register numbers following the Covid-19 emergency.</p>  <p>  The Department is increasing its case management activity on all of its employment support schemes to ensure that jobseekers continue to have the necessary access to the opportunities available.   CE candidates should not be constrained by existing CE participants remaining on their CE schemes beyond agreed end-dates.  My officials are working closely with CE sponsoring authorities to ensure they receive the necessary referrals for vacancies arising on their CE schemes.</p></reply>

The scheme is due to close for new applications on 17th September.  Changes have also been announced to the rate  of the pandemic unemployment payment to make it more sustainable given the extension period and to ensure that it is targeted at people who are most in need of the support.</p><p>From 17 September 2020 the pandemic unemployment payment will be paid at three rates.  People who previously earned over &euro;300 per week will receive &euro;300 per week.  A new rate of &euro;250 will apply to people who earned &euro;200 to &euro;300 and the rate of &euro;203 remains unchanged if they earned less than &euro;200. </p><p>In determining the appropriate rate of Pandemic Unemployment Payment in the case of self-employed individuals, my Department will take 2019 earnings into consideration where a person files their returns to Revenue.  Prior to this, the information used for the self-employed referred to that of 2018, which is the last tax year for which complete verifiable data on self-employed income is available.  This change may provide for an increased rate of payment depending on an individual&rsquo;s particular circumstances. Reviews can be submitted to PUPRerate@welfare.ie and should be accompanied by supporting documentation.  The Department will process applications for review as quickly as possible.</p><p>In order to give every opportunity to employed and self-employed workers to receive the highest possible rate of pandemic unemployment payment, my Department will undertake five distinct calculations and base the individual&rsquo;s rate on the one that is most financially advantageous to each customer.  This will be achieved by undertaking an individual calculation of each customer&rsquo;s rate based on their earnings from employment, self-employment and from a combination of both. </p><p>The functionality to facilitate this calculation is currently being developed and will be in place for the re-rating of the pandemic unemployment payment on the 17<sup>th</sup>of September.  At that point anyone who is on the reduced rate of Pandemic Unemployment Payment since June and would be better off under this calculation will receive the benefit of the new calculation backdated to the rate change introduced in June.</p><p>A self-employed person must have suffered a reduction in their trading income to the extent that they are available to take up other full-time work.  This allows some limited scope for a self-employed person to engage in once-off or emergency work and still retain eligibility for the pandemic unemployment payment.  This is essentially occasional, irregular or isolated events and where there is a clear divergence from previous employment patterns.  Where a self-employed individual has regular employment or it generates significant income, then they should close their Pandemic Unemployment Payment as they do not satisfy the conditions for the payment.  In cases of doubt, an individual should contact their local Intreo Centre for clarification on the matter. </p><p>The pandemic unemployment payment is closed for new applications from 17<sup>th</sup>September.  Where a person loses employment after the 17th September they may be eligible for support under the jobseekers schemes depending on their circumstances. </p><p>Jobseekers Benefit is a social insurance based income support for people who have suffered a substantial loss of employment and satisfy the other conditions of the scheme.  If a person does not qualify for Jobseekers Benefit they may be eligible for means tested Jobseekers Allowance.  Jobseekers Benefit Self- employed is available for self- employed people who are no longer trading.  A person in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment may take up employment but they must be unemployed for at least 4 days in 7 consecutive days to be eligible for a payment and continue to satisfy the other qualifying conditions of the schemes.  The maximum weekly rate for the jobseekers schemes is &euro;203 and increases may also be paid for any qualifying adults and children.</p><p>Any person who is experiencing financial hardship may access assistance under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme including Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments.  Information on the supports available under this scheme is available at <i>www.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>On 14 August I announced that applications have opened for the Enterprise Support Grant.  The Enterprise Support Grant previously supported entrepreneurs who were setting up new enterprises but has now been revamped to specifically provide once-off supports for self-employed people who have been severely impacted and have had to cease operations as a result of the Pandemic.  The grant of up to &euro;1000 is designed to help the self- employed small business owners who transition from the Pandemic Unemployment Payment to re-open their business.  It will be payable to self-employed micro enterprises that are not eligible for support from the COVID 19 Business Restart Grant or other similar business reopening grants.  A person must apply for the Enterprise Support Grant within 4 weeks of closing their Pandemic Unemployment Payment claim.  Details on the application process to access this grant is available on www.gov.ie. </p><p>I note that the Minister for Transport will reply directly to you regarding the specific transport issues mentioned.  Matters in relation to loan repayments, debt write off and taxation should be referred to the Minister for Finance. </p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Piloting Baby Boxes is one of many initiatives under First 5.  Others include supports for parents to balance working and caring, developments in early learning and care and health initiatives.</p>  <p>  Baby Boxes are packages of items and information to assist with the transition to parenthood including safety items, baby clothes, small toys, baby toothbrushes, and books to support early development. The intention behind Baby Boxes is to welcome a new arrival to a family, acknowledging this very significant moment for parents. It is envisaged that Baby Boxes will be distributed on a universal basis.  This reflects an important equality principle that each child, regardless of their circumstances, including immigration status, is given something of equal value.</p>  <p>  The project will pilot and test the design, items for inclusion, registration and distribution of Baby Boxes in a selected geographic area.  An evaluation will inform any plans about wider roll-out.</p>  <p>  Owing to COVID-19, work on this project has been delayed. However, an oversight group will be established later this year to oversee this development. </p>  <p>  An initial task of this Group will be to finalise the scope of this project and agree a detailed project plan. Key initial considerations will include the identification of the pilot geographic area, agreement on the optimal timing for (pre- or post- natal), and channel of, distribution of the baby box and the likely contents.  A researcher will be appointed to oversee focus groups and/or consultations with new and expectant parents to inform the identification of items for inclusion. </p>  <p>  Following this initial scoping phase, which should conclude by end Q1 2021, the Oversight Group will oversee a competitive procurement process to appoint suitable tenderers to a) develop and distribute the baby boxes and b) undertake a full evaluation of the pilot. Given the likely value of these contracts, the procurement process will take several months. It is therefore envisaged that distribution of the baby boxes will commence in end Q3 2021 / early Q4 2021.</p></reply>

It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years.</p><p>For the 2020 CAO system to proceed to pave the way for entry to higher education for the majority of applicants within the current timelines, and in a manner than can be properly upheld, 2020 results and the results of leaving certificate examinations from previous years must be treated equally in the CAO system.  </p><p>In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system, I have announced the creation of an additional 1,250 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. These places are provided in order to help ease anxiety and reduce uncertainty among students awaiting a CAO offer. Active engagement is currently underway with a view to providing further additional places in light of issues such as those raised by the Deputy.</p><p>Nonetheless, there will be fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year, which will depend on the volume of applications, the number of applicants who meet the entry requirements, the number of places available and the grades received by applicants. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more uncertainty than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland.</p><p>The first indications regarding movements of CAO points will not be clear until the completion of the first round process on Friday 11 September. The full picture, taking account of all supply and demand variables, will not be known until all places are filled at the end of the CAO process.<b></b>My Department will continue to monitor developments closely in collaboration with the higher education sector and the Department of Education.</p></reply>

The distance to be measured is the shortest non-tolled most direct route from the student&rsquo;s residence to the institution attended. The adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in the case of students whose normal residence is 45km or less from the approved institution which he or she is attending. The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant is payable in all other cases.</p><p>The measurement of the distances relating to the award of adjacent or non-adjacent rates of student grant is a matter for SUSI, the grant awarding authority. The distance measurement for student grant rates is governed by Article 27(3)(a) and (b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2020. This provides that the relevant distance will be measured in line with agreed guidelines. </p><p>The guidelines require that the shortest most direct route between the applicant's normal residence and the institution being attended should apply. In determining the shortest most direct route, the awarding authority shall establish:</p><p>-  the method for measuring a route; and</p><p>-  the factors to be taken into account in establishing and measuring a route. </p><p>SUSI has progressively introduced a number of measures that are intended to make the Student Grant Scheme more efficient for students. One of these measures was the introduction of Eircode which has helped to reduce processing times for applicants.</p><p>The distance is always measured from the student's normal residence to the campus the student is attending and never the reverse. The distance is always measured avoiding tolls. The 'depart at' time is set to 1am to ensure consistency by measuring each SUSI Applicant's adjacency at the same time</p><p>The decision on eligibility for student grant assistance is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. </p><p>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe. Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie.  </p><p>My officials advised that the student in question has engaged fully in the statutory appeals process and that on 1<sup>st</sup>September 2020 the independent Student Grant Appeals Board upheld the decisions of the grant awarding authority and the Appeals Officer and determined that the distance from the student&rsquo;s residence to the relevant third level institution was under 45km and the adjacent rate of grant was the correct rate of grant to be awarded.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

Prospective applicants on higher incomes may not have applied for support as their income was above the relevant threshold. As such, it is not possible to accurately cost the number of additional students who may qualify for support, if the thresholds are increased.   Allowing for the limitations regarding the accuracy of the costings, it is estimated that a 1% increase in the income thresholds would cost in the region of &euro;2m and a 10% increase would cost in the region of &euro;20m</p>  <p>  The above figures do not include any changes to the income thresholds for the special rate of maintenance grants which are linked to long-term social welfare payments nor do they include any changes to the post-graduate income thresholds. </p></reply>

The modular courses will be accredited in such a way as to provide building blocks to a full qualification should the student so wish.  Each module will also be stand-alone so that participants can acquire skills and put them into practice immediately in the workplace.  It is expected to fill c2,500 Full Time Equivalent (FTE)  places under this initiative. </p>  <p>  Over 15,000 places are also available as part of Springboard+ 2020 and the graduate conversion courses under HCI Pillar 1. Places are available on courses in a wide range of skills areas, including artificial intelligence, smart factory technology, sustainable energy, medical device technology and cybersecurity. Courses begin from autumn 2020 through to early 2021.</p>  <p>  Springboard+ courses provide opportunities to up and reskill to people who are unemployed, those looking to return to the workforce after a period away and those in employment. Courses are offered across the National Qualification Framework from Level 6 to 9 and are delivered by public and private higher education providers across the country.

To be eligible for grant assistance, students must be attending an approved full-time course at an approved institution. The Regulations prescribe that an approved course is a full-time course leading to a major higher education and training award which takes a minimum of two years to complete in an approved institution. </p>  <p>  Courses that are part-time or that are less than two years in duration or leading to a special purpose/minor award rather than a major award are not approved for the purposes of the Student Grant Scheme. Distance Learning Courses are regarded as part-time courses and, as such, do not qualify for grant assistance under the Student Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  Under Article 15(1) of the Student Grant Scheme, a grant can only be awarded for the normal duration of an approved course, and cannot be paid for any period of study that extends the normal course duration. </p>  <p>  In the context of limited public funding and competing priorities, student support funding is currently targeted at full-time students in approved institutions. The potential for reviewing options for existing access funding initiatives to part-time studies in higher education could only be considered in the context of the overall priorities and financial resources for access to higher education, and in the wider higher education funding context. There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the Student Grant Scheme to part-time (online/distance learning) courses. </p>  <p>  In terms of policy, planning for models of blended learning is taking place against a backdrop of an evolving public health environment. Changes to courses normally delivered on campus are in response to the evolving Covid-19 pandemic and are a temporary, evolving situation. </p>  <p>   In terms of supports for students with disabilities each HEI has an access and disability service in place to support students with disabilities. Students who feel that they may require supports from their institution should contact the access or disability service who will carry out a needs assessment in collaboration with the student. These supports will continue to be provided, as appropriate, where any online or blended learning takes place. </p>  <p>   The Fund Students with Disabilities (FSD) provides funding to higher and further education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can access, fully participate in and successfully complete their chosen course of study. This supports the overall goals of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education. In 2019 funding of &euro;9.6m was allocated to the FSD (covering both the higher education and further education sectors as well as Irish students studying in the UK and EU). The type of supports covered include:</p>  <p>  -  Assistive technology;</p>  <p>  -  Non-medical helpers;</p>  <p>  -  Academic/learning support;</p>  <p>  -  Deaf supports;</p>  <p>  -  Transport supports.</p>  <p>   Further Education and Training (FET) Institutions are planning a phased reopening for learners by 29 September and will aim to maximize learner onsite experience and endeavour to provide maximum possible face to face interaction taking into consideration all the risk factors and the requirements of the high-risk learner groups. Learning experience will be enhanced through onsite streaming facilities and blended learning.</p>  <p>   The Once-Off COVID-19 Grant (&euro;15m) to support disadvantaged students in accessing ICT devices is part of the package of COVID-19 supports for higher and further education institutions funded by my Department.  </p>  <p>  The devices will be distributed by the relevant Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and Education and Training Boards (ETBs) via appropriate lending schemes.  The education institutions are best placed to determine which individual students should be prioritised to receive a device on a needs basis and within the terms and conditions of the scheme.  In determining distribution of the devices, HEIs are required to have regard to the target groups, including students with disabilities, identified in the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 </p>  <p>  HEIs and ETBs must be satisfied that students who receive a device under this grant have demonstrated a verifiable need for such a device e.g. they or their family do not have the means to purchase such a device themselves. Students should contact their HEI access office for further information.</p></reply>

This dedicated funding is additional to the &euro;31 million in Exchequer funding invested in TU development and progression to date.</p><p>Under the statutory framework provided in the Technological Universities Act 2018, two or more IoTs may jointly seek TU designation through a prescribed legislative process. Section 29 of the 2018 Act provides for the application jointly by two or more applicant institutes to the Minister of Education and Skills for an order seeking designation as a TU subject to their jointly meeting specified eligibility criteria.  Section 38 of the 2018 Act provides that an applicant institute and an established technological university may apply to the Minister for an order. </p><p>As autonomous higher education institutes established under statute, it remains a matter for the governing body of an IoT to set the institute&rsquo;s  particular strategic direction within the higher education landscape, including whether or not to seek TU designation through the prescribed legal processes.</p><p>In June 2020, Dundalk Institute of Technology (DKIT) launched a new three-year strategic plan which articulates it&rsquo;s mission to be a leader for higher education and craft apprenticeships, and the engine for growth and social cohesion in North Leinster-South Ulster through the achievement of TU status and strengthened cross-border alliances. In this context the Department understands that DKIT has been in discussions with a number of TU development consortia.</p><p>The HEA is currently involved in a process with eligible higher education institutions to ascertain funding requirements under the new TU Transformation Fund towards 2023. In this context the HEA has indicated its willingness to work with and support DKIT to facilitate a process to place the institute on a trajectory in line with their stated ambition to pursue TU status.  Formal submissions under the fund were made to the HEA at the end of August 2020. The HEA is currently reviewing these and considering future funding allocations, with a view to making allocations in October.</p></reply>

The amount of ASC charged to apprentices is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time spent in the institution during the academic year. In cases where training is delivered in an Education and Training Board there is no contribution made by the apprentice. </p>  <p>  For craft apprenticeships, the ASC charged is pro-rated to the &euro;3,000 ASC paid by students attending for the full academic year and so amounts to approximately &euro;1,000 per apprentice per period spent in the IoT/TU Dublin.  Craft apprentices typically spend two blocks of time (Phase 4 &amp;amp; 6) in a HEI. In the case of the new consortia led apprenticeships the contribution varies for each programme as their off-the-job training has a more flexible structure.   </p>  <p>  The removal of the ASC for apprentices in full would result in an estimated cost of &euro;4.8 million per annum to the State.

They provide a basis for the 16 Education and Training Boards to contract with community bodies to provide a service initiative in a locality where there are identified community needs. Training provision is intended to be sufficiently flexible to address the identified need for the initiative and is typically six to twelve months in duration. Training provision organised through this programme is not intended to be permanent and it is this aspect that gives Education and Training Boards the flexibility to use resources in the community in response to emerging needs.  </p><p>LTI progammes enable local communities to carry out valuable and necessary projects of benefit to their communities, while training participants in areas related to the project work so that they can go on to gain employment or progress to further training. The LTI programme is focused on addressing the training needs of unemployed learners who are economically, socially, geographically or educationally disadvantaged.  Learners are primarily between 18 and 35 years of age, with no formal qualifications or incomplete secondary level qualifications.  LTIs provide participants with specific vocational skills, as well as broader general and ICT skills and work experience.  The context of training delivery is focused on the progression of projects run by local community groups and for the benefit of the local community, which provides the opportunity for learners to apply their newly developed vocational skills in a work based context.</p><p>My Department is committed to the continuing development of Local Training Initiatives and the important services that they provide to learners within communities. I enclose attached details of locations relating to Local Training Initiatives delivered in 2018, 2019 and planned for 2020. In addition, the attached also contains details of the LTI reported number of beneficiaries for 2018, 2019 and the projected number for 2020.</p></reply>

Students pay a student contribution of &euro;3,000 per annum which can be paid in instalments.  </p>  <p>  The state pays the contribution in full or part for an estimated 44 per cent of all students eligible for free fees funding through SUSI. The estimated cost was in the order of &euro;180million for 2019/2020. </p>  <p>  Student contribution funded by the state is in addition to over &euro;340million paid for student tuition fees in 2019/20 through our free fees initiative.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to develop a long-term sustainable funding model for higher level education.  In addition I intend to specifically examine student supports to ensure all students have access to educational opportunities and supports that will help them to fulfil their potential. </p>  <p>  While the balance of costs and benefits of Higher Education will be considered as part of the broader strategic reform of higher education funding, the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on students and families has been the subject of immediate attention.  </p>  <p>  In July I announced &euro;168 million in funding to support the sector and students including a &euro;15million fund for technology supports, a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund and &euro;5 million for mental health supports.</p>  <p>  The pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on younger workers and those in lower paid occupations. In the July Stimulus Package we provided &euro;100m in funding for the tertiary education and training sector to help support upskilling and reskilling, which will fund over 35,000 places in 2020. </p>  <p>  Covid-19 requirements mean that the delivery of third level education costs more, not less. As a consequence the Government has provided a major increase in funding to meet those costs but also to significantly enhance the range of supports available to students particularly those with the least financial  resources.</p></reply>

This is being actioned through:</p>  <p>  -  Delivery of a training module twice a year to frontline Garda&iacute;; and</p>  <p>  - Development and dissemination of an Information Guide for all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The latest Report of the Monitoring Committee for the Strategy notes that this action is meeting the targets as set out in the Strategy. </p>  <p>  Action 61 of the Migrant Integration Strategy, sets out the State&rsquo;s obligation across Departments to provide intercultural awareness training to staff where it is appropriate to their role.  For frontline staff such as medical and Garda&iacute;, this is particularly important as they may be the first point of contact with at-risk women and girls. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed under Action 63 of the Migrant Integration Strategy to continue to implement a victim-centred policy and good investigative practices in racial or other similar crimes.</p>  <p>  I note that the first conviction under that legislation was secured in the courts in November of last year and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na took the opportunity to highlight through the national media the dangers and the illegal nature of the practice. </p></reply>

It specifies that a person to whom this section applies may be arrested by an immigration officer or a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and detained in a prescribed place of detention for the purpose of facilitating their removal from the State, which must be as soon as is practicable. </p><p>It is the general practice to remove persons from the State on the next available flight or ship. </p><p>The numbers of persons refused leave to land by the Border Management Unit (BMU) of my Department at Dublin Airport since 27 March 2020 are as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Month</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>27/03/2020 &ndash; 31/03/2020</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June</td>       <td>34</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July</td>       <td>188</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>August</td>       <td>246</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01/09/2020 &ndash; 08/09/2020</td>       <td>60</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>586</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The BMU has responsibility for frontline immigration services at Dublin Airport only and other ports of entry are the responsibility of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).</p><p>I have asked An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to compile the necessary information from the individual districts. It has not been possible in the time available to provide these details and I will communicate the information to the Deputy once it is available from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Should any person who has been refused leave to land in the State seek entry to the State at a future point, their application will be assessed on its own merits taking all relevant information into consideration at that time. Their prior immigration history is a matter of record but it does not preclude them from seeking permission to enter the State in the future. </p></reply>

This work meant the Department was in a position to respond earlier to issues that were arising online, when most of its workforce was working remotely. </p>  <p>  It also enabled my Department to respond to, or investigate issues, that were being raised on social media platforms that were not being raised directly with the Department, its service providers, or through the various helplines or supports put in place for various agencies. Understanding the conversations that were happening online also assisted my Department in responding to queries raised by national and regional journalists on behalf of the public. This initial response to the pandemic is not now required and has been discontinued. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that my Department has not engaged any external bodies or companies as part of the social media evaluation reports being prepared.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  -  be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  -  have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  -  have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded and these key legal requirements have not changed since 2006. The option to establish a Community CCTV scheme is available to groups that meet these legal requirements, anywhere in the country.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. To date, 29 applications have been approved under the scheme, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;689,000. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, last year the grant aid scheme was extended to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p>  <p>  However in all cases, grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner. </p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie.</p></reply>

For example, Property Crime has reduced by 16%, Burglary (non-aggravated) has reduced by 15% and Crimes Against The Person have reduced by 17%.  The circumstances surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic are considered to have been a factor in such significant reductions.  I can inform the Deputy that the official crime statistics from the CSO for the second quarter of 2020 are due to be released later this month and I look forward to reviewing these statistics when they are available. The statistics for Q2 of this year will be of particular benefit in terms of assessing the impact of Covid-19 on crime trends.</p><p>The CSO crime statistics for Q1 2020 showed that while there have been increases in the Meath division in some crimes, such as theft, compared to the same period in 2017, there have been welcome decreases over this time period of 28% in recorded burglary and related offences and 26% in public order offences in Meath. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, Census 2016 results show that Meath is one of the fastest growing counties in the country with the population growing by 5.9 per cent between 2011 and 2016 to 195,044.  This population growth rate is the second fastest growth rate recorded in the State (after Fingal).  The Meath Garda Division contains four Districts - Navan, Ashbourne, Trim and Kells - and 16 Garda Stations. The Garda strength of Meath Division at 31 July 2020, the latest date for which figures are available, is 335 members and 43 Garda Staff.  There have been several allocations of Trainees to the Division over recent years which has resulted in an increase in personnel, mainly in Navan and Ashbourne Districts.</p><p>That said, I am very conscious of how the impact of anti-social behaviour affects the quality of life for local communities. Preventing children getting involved in and diverting children away from criminality when they have already become involved is a key priority for me as Minister for Justice and the Programme for Government contains a number of commitments with regard to tackling anti-social behaviour. </p><p>Some of the measures either currently underway or due to be progressed in line with the Programme for Government include: </p><p>- A commitment to set up a special expert forum on antisocial behaviour, to consider the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders. </p><p>- New legislation, implementing the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which will, among other elements, redefine policing to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable. This approach will mandate multi-agency collaboration, in conjunction with impacted communities, to address in a holistic way the range of social problems including those exploited by criminals to involve young people;</p><p>- The Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC) programme has had success managing prolific offenders and the Programme for Government includes a commitment to extend the pilot scheme of the programme to more areas to target prolific repeat and vulnerable offenders aged 16-21; </p><p>- The Garda Youth Diversion Programme and over 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects operate nationwide. Funding for these projects has increased every year since 2015. &euro;15.3 million was provided in 2019 and at least &euro;15.6 million has been committed for 2020;</p><p>- Development of a Youth Justice Strategy 2020-2026 is currently underway. This includes consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, including early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release. </p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders; for example, the Community Alert Programme and the Garda Text Alert Scheme.</p><p>These projects are being progressed in parallel with record investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. &euro;1.88 billion has been allocated to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2020 along with &euro;116m in capital investment.  This investment is aiding the sustained growth of the organisation and there are now more approximately 14,700 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff. </p><p>Extensive information is available on my Department&rsquo;s website in relation to the numbers of Garda members and their assignment nationwide at the following link: </p><p>This information is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Details in relation to the number of Garda staff nationwide are also available on my Department's website at the following link: </p></reply>

The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process.  In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  </p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the Immigration Service of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

While it ensures that these basic needs are met, the intervening years have shown that people claiming international protection need a system that is responsive to their individual needs and that fully respects their right to privacy and family life.</p>  <p>  A number of important reforms have been introduced in recent years under my predecessors, most notably the roll-out of cooking facilities across centres to support independent living; the introduction of labour market access to foster greater economic independence; and the agreement of National Standards to promote consistency in services and standards across centres. Currently we impress upon all our service providers to upgrade their facilities to independent living in line with the National Standards. The Department commenced  a tender process in late 2018 to source suitable premises for the provision of accommodation services. As a result, a number of regional tender competitions have been  advertised, assessed and awarded. The competitions were held for the South East, Midlands, Mid-West, South-West, Mid-East, West, Dublin and the Border Regions. Any new contract awarded will be required to meet these new national standards. Discussions are ongoing with the OPW in relation to State centres and the requirement that they meet the these new National Standards.</p>  <p>  More needs to be done. The Government has committed to ending the current system of Direct Provision within the lifetime of the Government and to replacing it with a new international protection accommodation policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach.   </p>  <p>  Responsibility for the accommodation system is transferring from my Department to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and officials from both Departments are making the necessary arrangements to facilitate the transfer of functions as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Last year, Dr. Catherine Day was asked to bring together an expert group with representation from asylum seekers and NGOs to examine best practice in other European States in the provision of services to international protection applicants, to examine likely longer term trends and to set out recommendations and solutions. Any new system for the provision of accommodation and additional supports to international protection applicants will be informed by the Report of this Expert Group, which is expected by the end of this month.</p>  <p>  The intention is to publish a White Paper by the end of this year, informed by the recommendations of the Expert Group, which will set out how a replacement to the Direct Provision system will be structured and the steps to achieving it. It will be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration, to progress the matter following the transfer of this function to his Department.</p></reply>

Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.</p><p>The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.  It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated. </p><p>CAB have been central to many recent significant operations to combat organised criminal activity.  The Deputy may be aware that as part of Operation Coronation, on 17 June last, in excess of 170 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from Limerick, Clare and Tipperary Divisions supported by the Criminal Assets Bureau carried out 67 searches at dwellings, businesses and land in Counties Limerick, Clare and Tipperary. Garda&iacute; arrested 14 people and seized approximately &euro;220,000 in euros and foreign currency as wells as deeds to overseas property and &euro;100,000 in jewellery and luxury watches. Two bank accounts have also been frozen containing sums in excess of &euro;119,000.  Significant evidence to support the investigation including financial accounts and property documentation was also recovered as well as &euro;23,500 of suspected drugs and two cocaine presses.</p><p>The Criminal Assets Bureau, under the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996-2016, has frozen assets to the value of &euro;231,918,179, GBP &pound;21,864,840 and USD $12,935,685 under Section 2 and Section 3 for the years 1996 &ndash; 2019.</p><p>The investigations conducted by the Criminal Assets Bureau and the consequential proceedings and actions resulted in &euro;194,518,433.05 returned to the Exchequer as a whole for the years 1996 &ndash; 2019, a breakdown of which is below:</p><p>Proceeds of Crime legislation: &euro;30,519,179</p><p>Revenue legislation:&euro;159,284,028</p><p>Social Welfare legislation:&euro;4,715,226</p><p><b>Total Returned to Exchequer:&euro;194,518,433</b></p><p>The Deputy will be aware that CAB published its Strategic Plan for 2020 to 2023 in July of this year.  The strategic plan describes the structure of CAB and its key programmes of activity to deliver its remit. CAB has trained a nationwide network of asset profilers to identify assets acquired from the proceeds of criminal conduct. The Bureau continues to develop specialist expertise and technology to trace and investigate these assets. It also continues to work closely with international crime investigation agencies, and has successfully targeted proceeds of foreign criminality from countries such as the US and the UK.</p></reply>

The 1941 and 1945 Acts provide compensation in respect of death or injury which is maliciously inflicted upon a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while on duty or in connection with their duties. </p><p>The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) was approached, with the assistance of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and agreed involvement in the proposed new compensation arrangements.  The PIAB will, under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, assess quantum in Garda compensation cases. </p><p>I understand that, during the preparation of the new General Scheme, a copy of same was circulated to the Garda Commissioner and to the Garda Representative Associations. The General Scheme was amended to reflect their key concerns. In addition, the views of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the State Claims Agency, and the PIAB were taken into account in developing the Scheme. </p><p>Following approval by Government, the General Scheme was submitted to the Office of the Attorney General for drafting. Work is ongoing and officials from my Department will engage with stakeholders, including the Garda Representative Associations.</p><p>The Scheme is intended to operate along the following broad lines&mdash;</p><p>- The member will, within 6 months of the injury, submit an application for compensation to the Garda Commissioner,</p><p>- the Commissioner will arrange for the preparation of a report confirming that the injury was inflicted as a result of a malicious incident as defined in the legislation,</p><p>- if the report is to the effect that the injury was inflicted as a result of a malicious incident, the member is entitled to compensation,</p><p>- if the report is to the effect that the injury was not inflicted as a result of a malicious incident, the member will be able to seek a review by the review officer,</p><p>- if the review officer determines that the injury was inflicted as a result of a malicious incident, the member is entitled to compensation and the claim proceeds,</p><p>- where the report determines that the injury was inflicted as a result of a malicious incident, the report together with the application and accompanying documentation is to be sent directly to PIAB and the State Claims Agency by the Commissioner or review officer, as the case may be,</p><p>- PIAB will process the application in accordance with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 and make an assessment of quantum,</p><p>- applicant and respondent (State Claims Agency on behalf of Commissioner) will be notified of the assessment and have an opportunity to accept or reject the assessment,</p><p>- if either or both reject, PIAB will authorise applicant to proceed to court, the State Claims Agency will manage the court proceedings on behalf of the State.</p></reply>

This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation. There are now almost 14,700 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff and these numbers are continuing to grow.

With regard to recruitment plans for 2020, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have confirmed that they still intend to run a sworn member recruitment plan this year.  </p><p>I am informed that approximately 150 new recruits commenced training under a revised delivery method, in light of the current circumstances.

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters, however I fully support the Commissioner and his management team in their efforts to strengthen and diversify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in all areas.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that the total number of women in all ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as of the 31 August 2020, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 4,003 or approximately  27 % of the total strength of 14,628. This compares favourably with 3,130 or 21.7% of the total strength on 31 December 2008.  While this is broadly in line with other police services in England and Wales, there is clearly plenty of scope for improvement.  At the critical leadership rank of Assistant Commissioner I welcome the fact that 44% are women with the recent promotion of two women to this rank.</p><p>The Report of Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland recommended that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to develop its recruitment strategies to reach a more diverse intake of students</p><p>In addition, the report also recommended that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should reflect the diversity of Irish society, not only in gender and ethnicity, but also in terms of socio-economic, educational and geographical backgrounds and that they would need to develop recruitment strategies which reach a more diverse intake. The Report also recommended the reform of the current roster system to support the wellbeing of all Garda Members and introducing greater flexibility in work practices to enhance the attractiveness and job satisfaction of policing as a career.  </p><p>In this regard, I am advised that work is well advanced on the development of an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy for the Garda workforce and I look forward to engaging with the Garda Commissioner on its implementation.</p><p>For the Deputy's information I have attached below in tabular form, the Garda strength by gender and rank on the 31 August 2020, the latest date for which figures are currently available, as supplied by the Commissioner. <table>    <tr>       <th>Rank</th>       <th>Male </th>       <th>Female</th>       <th>Female as % of total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Commissioner. </td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Deputy Commissioner.</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Commissioner. </td>       <td>5</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>44%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Chief Superintendent. </td>       <td>37</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>21%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Superintendent. </td>       <td>149</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>10%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Inspector. </td>       <td>307</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>19%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sergeant. </td>       <td>1,630</td>       <td>471</td>       <td>22%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Garda.</td>       <td>8,495</td>       <td>3,431</td>       <td>29%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>10,625</td>       <td>4,003</td>       <td>27%</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

As Minister I have no direct role in these matters. I am assured by the Commissioner that the allocation of resources is kept under constant review to respond to emerging crime trends. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are of course continuing in their duties to prevent and investigate crime in addition to their specific role in supporting public health restrictions during the Covid-19 emergency.  As such, long-standing legislation for offences such as public order, assault, road traffic, and drugs continue to be used.  For example, while conducting Covid-19 patrols or checkpoints, Garda&iacute; have had a number of significant seizures of drugs and other illicit items, including firearms, and have made arrests in that regard.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner, on 13 March 2020, when announcing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s measures to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted that resources assigned to specialist units, including drugs units, were not affected by these measures. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had commenced a process to establish/re-invigorate Drugs Units in each Garda Division. The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (NDOCB) leads in tackling all forms of drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs in Ireland. It is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs in Ireland, as well as organised crime groups. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also remains committed to tackling the supply of drugs by supporting local communities through various preventative and detection initiatives and engagement with Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces; the Garda Youth Diversion Programme and Projects; the Garda Schools Programme; the Joint Policing Committees and Community Policing Fora.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Divisional Drug Units are now established in every Garda Division. The uninterrupted policing of organised crime at a national level and considerable increase in the size of Divisional Drugs Units at a local level, during the policing of the COVID-19 pandemic, has contributed to this success in seizing controlled drugs and in the apprehension of those involved in the sale and supply of the substances involved.</p>  <p>  In addition, the significant increase in the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na circulating in communities and engaged in checkpoints throughout the State, has also presented an obstacle to the movement of criminals.</p>  <p>  It is important that communities work together with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this task. Reporting by the public of illegal activity, including drug dealing or intimidation, is important to assist in this work and there are a range of channels to do so, including through the Garda Confidential Line 1800 666 111; as well as the &ldquo;Dial to Stop Drug Dealing&rdquo; campaign run in partnership with Crimestoppers at 1800 25 00 25.</p></reply>

Residential settings are people&rsquo;s homes as well as places where health and social care are provided. The introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. I am very much aware of how difficult the restrictions on visits to LTRCs are for residents and their families. </p><p>However, NPHET has advised that LTRC settings gradually reintroduce usual activities while taking public health precautions. Families are encouraged to talk to the support staff at the person&rsquo;s residence, to make arrangements for visits and other activities that can be facilitated within the current public health guidance. This guidance will continue to be reviewed in line with the disease progression and guidelines will be updated.  The most recent guidance is available here: <i></i></p><p>It is important to recall that people living in LTRC  facilities are particularly vulnerable populations in the context of Covid-19 and have been identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be at a higher risk of being susceptible to infection from this disease and for subsequent adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, it is important that the rights of residents to have visitors is balanced with the need to ensure that visitations do not compromise overall resident care or adherence to requisite infection control procedures. The guidance above is clear that LTRC service providers and / or the Person in Charge should facilitate visits as part of the return to the normal activity of the setting. </p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to an individual case, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

The charge would be reduced by &euro;0.50c to &euro;1 per item for the over 70s and by &euro;0.50c to &euro;1.50 for persons under70. The maximum monthly charge would also be reduced to &euro;10 and &euro;15 espectively.</p><p>- The monthly threshold of &euro;124 for the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS) would be reduced by &euro;10 to &euro;114 per household.</p><p>The funding of these measures was predicated on the achievement of corresponding savings in the health budget in 2020. It has not been possible to achieve these savings to date and therefore I am not in a position at present to progress the changes to prescription charges. I will keep this matter under review in the light of the funding available to the health service in 2020 and 2021.</p></reply>

This Act provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under. The initial stage of this phased expansion will be the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged between 6 and 8.</p>  <p>  The appropriate date for commencing the expansion remains under consideration in light of COVID-19 and the additional pressures the expansion might place on general practice in that context and in anticipation of the usual increase in demand for healthcare services over the winter period. This date will be determined in consultation with the IMO. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 8th July 2020. </p><p>In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.</p><p>The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.</p><p>Day services began to gradually resume during the month of August and will continue to do so throughout early September. Service providers are working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.</p><p>The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: <i>www.hse.ie/newdirections</i>. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, and the latest update, a video message from the Head of Strategy and Planning HSE Disability Services, is available at the above link.  </p><p>An information portal that contains the dates on which the 966 disability day service locations will reopen around the country is now available. Service users and families can access this information on <i>www.hse.ie/newdirections</i></p><p>It has been recognised that additional costs may arise for service providers in providing safe services. To date, Government has approved COVID 19 Pandemic Health service funding of &euro;2bn. The aim of this funding is to support investment necessary to address COVID 19, to mitigate risk of the spread of COVID 19 and to facilitate the provision of health and social care services against the backdrop of COVID 19. The HSE is in the process of reviewing and validating business cases from disability services providers for additional funding to support the reopening of services.</p><p>As the Deputy's question also pertains to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to reply to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy is being overseen by the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which comprises key Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group. </p>  <p>Under the Strategy  ,  the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport and is committed to the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  Recent developments which will impact on policy options regarding the provision of transport supports for people with a disability include the following: </p>  <p>- The ongoing progress by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in providing accessible public transport nationally   and that Department's public consultation launched on 14 November last, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport;  </p>  <p>- The Cost of Disability Study   currently underway which was commissioned by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as part of Budget 2019.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs; and </p>  <p>- The Working Group established under Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy by the Department of Justice and Equality which states that:- 'We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo;    </p>  <p>  Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners; the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p>  <p>  By way of background, two schemes, the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant, were put in place in 1979 and 1968 respectively, for operation by the Health Service Executive (HSE) at a time when there was limited availability of accessible public transport.  The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013, on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts.  The recommendations of the 2013 Project  Group which was established to review how to meet the transport needs of people with disabilities, informed the considerations of the 2013 Inter-Departmental Group chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly Mobility Allowance on an interim basis, to those who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the Scheme closed.  Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there were 3,831 people in receipt of the interim payments at July 2019.</p></reply>

Funding for a further 40 adult critical care beds, and two paediatric critical care beds, was provided as part of the response to Covid-19 in March 2020.

The report illustrates the significant progress made by providers since HIQA commenced independent regulation of designated residential centres for adults and children with disabilities in Ireland in 2013.  It also demonstrates that HIQA, as the independent regulatory authority charged with ensuring high quality and safe care for people using our health and social care services, has had a recognised positive impact on the lives of people with a disability who avail of our residential services.  In 2018, all disability residential services were approved as designated centres, meaning that each of these centres has met the required standards for registration.</p>  <p>It is heartening to note that most residents told HIQA inspectors that they were happy in their homes, but we know that there is more to do to ensure that people with a disability can live 'ordinary lives in ordinary places' in line with the Transforming Lives disability reform programme.  To this end, the Government is committed to continuing with the successful de-congregation programme and completing a further move of more people with disabilities from congregated settings to homes in the community, with the necessary supports, as outlined in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and made considerable improvements to access for patients waiting for high volume procedures including cataracts. At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. As of the end of July 2020, there were 5,525 patients waiting for a cataract procedure. Of these, 1,107 are waiting over 9 months which represents a reduction of 74% when compared to July 2017, when there were 4,249 waiting over 9 months.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. </p><p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause most elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p><p>NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the pausing of all non-urgent health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.</p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.</p><p>As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy concerning the waiting times for cataract surgery in each hospital in which such surgery takes place, is outlined in the link provided below, provided to my Department by the NTPF.</p><p>">Waiting list report</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine. </p>  <p>  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for the following reasons:</p>  <p>  - vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;</p>  <p>  - boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p></reply>

The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013, on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts.  </p>  <p>  In 2013, the Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly Mobility Allowance on an interim basis, to those who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the Scheme closed.  Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there were 3,831 people in receipt of the interim payments at July 2019. </p>  <p>  Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners; the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p>  <p>At the whole of Government level, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  Monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy   is being overseen by the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which comprises key Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group. </p>  <p>Under the Strategy  ,  the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport and is committed to the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  Recent developments which will impact on policy options regarding the provision of transport supports for people with a disability include the following:</p>  <p>- The ongoing progress by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in providing accessible public transport nationally   and that Department's public consultation launched on 14 November last, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport;   </p>  <p>- The Cost of Disability Study   currently underway which was commissioned by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as part of Budget 2019.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs; and </p>  <p>- The Working Group established under Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy by the Department of Justice and Equality which states that:-   'We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo;</p></reply>

It confers no guarantee that the individual with a 'not detected' result is not incubating the infection or the level of virus is below detectable levels at the time of the test. It is for this reason that testing of close contacts of a confirmed case is carried out on two separate occasions, when they are first identified and again 7 days after their last contact with the person.</p>  <p>  Success in detecting Covid-19 is affected by the timing of sampling, the type and quality of the sample and the test used to analyse the sample. However, no single test is 100% sensitive or 100% specific. Extensive validations have been carried out in our laboratories, with national collation of data, to ensure that the tests used show high sensitivity.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. </p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.  Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

There is a range of supports in place, including specific agri-taxation measures to incentivise this generational change. These agri-taxation measures specifically aimed at young farmers include 100% stock relief on income tax for certain young trained farmers and stamp duty exemption on transfers of land to young trained farmers. </p>  <p>  Under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme, there is also an enhanced capital investment scheme for young trained farmers under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes. This Scheme provides them with grant aid at a rate of 60% of the cost of the investment, compared to the standard grant rate of 40%, and I believe it is an important support and encouragement to young farmers starting in agriculture for the first time.</p>  <p>  Generational renewal continues to be a priority for my Department and will form an important part of the CAP post-2020. My Department and I are actively engaging with other Member States and the EU on these issues during the current negotiations on new CAP proposals. We can then consider in more detail when we have the final EU Regulations as part of the wider consideration of all proposals for the next CAP.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-10a.717.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020091000061#WRM05500"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 318 of 2020) was signed into force on 26 August 2020 and fully meet the requirement of the relevant EU regulations insofar as sea fishing boat licence holders are concerned.  </p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Fisheries Control Regulation 1224//2009 and EU Commission Implementing Regulation 404/2011 introduced points systems for serious infringements of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy committed by the licence holder of a fishing vessel and also separately the master. These are intended to complement sanctions and promote compliance and were required to be in place on 1st of January 2012.    </p>  <p>  Both of these EU regulations went through the ordinary legislative procedures at EU level which would have included widespread consultation with interested parties including the Member States, Advisory Councils, NGOs and the fishing industry.  The matter has also been discussed at industry liaison meetings over the years.  It should also be noted that the EU regulations are highly prescriptive in relation to licence holders, leaving little room for further amendment. </p>  <p>  These new regulations are a requirement of EU law and have been since 2012.  All other coastal member States have implemented this EU points system.  Ireland is in breach of its EU legal obligations  as a result of its failure to implement them up to now. </p>  <p>  As a result, the EU Commission under Infringement proceedings issued a Reasoned Opinion to Ireland in July 2020 and has given Ireland three months to respond. The implementation of these regulations was already overdue, but their urgency has been amplified by the Reasoned Opinion. </p>  <p>  In addition, the European Commission has formally suspended payment to Ireland of EU co-funding payments under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Operational Programme. This suspension will continue indefinitely until Ireland puts in place the necessary legislation and administrative systems to comply with the EU Points System.   Unless the regulatory lacuna is addressed immediately, we face an increasing financial cost to taxpayers.  EU funds for control and enforcement available to Ireland under the EMFF are &euro;37.2m over the course of the Programme. As of September 2020, approximately &euro;13.5m in payments due were withheld. These will likely rise to approximately &euro;24.5m in 2020 and a total of &euro;37.2m is at risk for the full period of the Programme. </p>  <p>  The new S.I. takes on board in full the findings of the related 2017 Supreme Court judgement that the procedures followed are fair and in accordance with best practices.  It involves a Determination panel comprising of 3 independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General and offers a licence holder the option of an oral hearing for the purposes of the determination.   In addition, a decision may be appealed to an independent Appeals Officer nominated by the Attorney General and the licence holder has the option of seeking an oral hearing also at this stage.   </p>  <p>  The new SI includes a number of, but not all, amendments sought as a result of consultations with the industry. I am satisfied that the new arrangements are the minimum required to meet the tests of proportionality, effectiveness and dissuasiveness required under EU law.  The adoption of this new SI is also in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.   </p>  <p>  I am confident that the new enhanced points system will play a vital role in delivering on the Common Fisheries Policy objective of ensuring proportionate, effective and dissuasive penalties for serious infringements, and contribute to a level-playing field in fisheries control across Member States. The points system is necessary as an effective measure against the small number &ndash; either foreign or Irish - who break the rules. It is necessary to protect the vast majority of our law abiding fishermen from the small few who would incur repeated serious infringements and put in jeopardy the fish stocks for all of our law abiding fishermen and for future generations.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the concerns that have been raised by the sector and will meet representatives in due course and to listen to and discuss the rationale for this Statutory Instrument.</p></reply>

His document, Review of Approval Processes for Afforestation in Ireland, was published in November 2019 and included 22 &ldquo;Ways Forward&rdquo; for the Department and industry stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to implement these recommendations and my colleague, Minister Pippa Hackett, is considering the appointment of an independent chair to oversee the implementation of the actions in the Report.  Furthermore, the Forestry Programme Implementation Group (FRIG), which comprises of relevant stakeholders, will monitor that implementation.   A review of the FPIG is underway to ensure that it is balanced and representative and it is hoped that those invited to be members will fully engage with the work of the Group.</p>  <p>  I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that there have been delays in issuing licences.  It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place. A majority of my Department's licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee which gives confidence in these revised procedures. </p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required. </p>  <p>  The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritises files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.  </p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, is overseeing and monitoring delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.  While much of the success of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it.  This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit only applications which have a realistic chance of being planted, to ensure all applications are of the required standard and quality, and to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided.</p>  <p>  There is also  a commitment under the Programme for Government to review the forestry appeals process to ensure that it is aligned with other comparable appeals processes. That is why a draft amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 is being introduced.  The public consultation period for the draft Bill recently closed, with almost 9,000 submissions received.  These submissions will inform the updated version of the Bill  which will be presented to the Oireachtas.  The introduction of these amendments will be accompanied by an on-line portal on which forestry licence applications and site details will be easily accessible to any interested party</p>  <p>  I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p></reply>

This pilot was very well received and every year since, a new FKTG scheme has been opened, including this year.  </p><p>The aim of the KTG scheme is to increase the level of forest management activity amongst participating forest owners. The target group are those forest owners that require additional knowledge to help them undertake one or more management activities in their forests.  KTGs will provide the mechanism for gaining this expertise and empower them to manage their own forest over its rotation.  By filling this knowledge gap, a potential barrier to the mobilisation of timber and biomass can be removed. </p><p>Groups are managed by an organiser, who may also be the group facilitators.  Groups comprise 20 participants, who meet over seven events, both indoor and outdoor.  Outdoor events may comprise visits to forests to demonstrate management activities or to sawmills.Peer-to-peer learning is the key tool, with participants setting their own learning agenda, with the facilitator structuring and guiding the discussion.  </p><p>The scheme comprises mandatory and optional topics.  The mandatory topics cover <i>inter alia</i>, obligations in respect of the Water Framework, Habitats and Birds Directives; health and safety; felling decision support tool; and, sustainable forestry methods and technologies.  There is a range of 28 optional subjects including reforestation, woodland improvement and non-timber benefits of forestry. The delivery of this year's programme will, of course,  be in accordance with, and conditional on, Covid-19 guidelines.</p><p>I am very pleased to note that participation in these schemes has increased year-on-year, as outlined in the following table:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>No. of Groups</th>       <th>No. of participants</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>605</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>614</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>840</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>
