    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-17a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061700075#WRA00600"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for the opportunity to clarify the role of the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles (SPSVs), sometimes known as the Taxi Advisory Committee. </p>  <p>  The Committee was established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 to provide both the Minister and the NTA with advice in relation to small public service vehicles and their drivers. Neither the NTA nor the Minister are bound by any advice provided. To ensure that the Committee can provide an informed view on relevant policy and regulatory matters, its composition is prescribed by legislation to ensure that it represents a broad range of interests and, insofar as is practicable, ensures an equitable gender balance between men and women, and equitable representation from both urban and rural areas. There is currently one vacancy on the Committee.</p>  <p>  Drivers are an important part of the Committee&rsquo;s membership and four positions on the Committee are reserved for members who can represent driver interests. All four of these positions are filled by licenced SPSV drivers from across the country and I am satisfied that this ensures the Committee&rsquo;s advice is informed by the perspective of drivers. The Committee also features dispatch operators, passenger representatives, including members representing the interests of disabled passengers and older passengers, members from the tourist industry, local government and from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am of the view that one of the strengths of the Committee is this broad and diverse representation and I regard the perspective of passengers to be of particular importance when considering SPSV policy issues.</p>  <p>  Members of the Committee are appointed by the Minister. Although the legislation prescribes the composition of the Advisory Committee, it does not provide for a specific method for filling vacancies on the Committee and, accordingly, the approach taken over the years has varied. The unpaid nature of positions on the Committee has, at times, posed a challenge in recruiting suitable candidates through open competition. Most of the current membership was appointed following an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service in June 2019, however, this competition failed to attract enough suitable candidates and two vacancies remained unfilled for a period. Three further vacancies arose since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  COVID-19 has had a profound effect on the SPSV sector and I was keen to ensure that drivers were represented on the Committee during this difficult time. In view of difficulties encountered in the previous PAS competition in filling all of the vacancies, and given the additional challenges associated with running a formal competition in the present climate, the NTA was asked to engage with taxi representative groups to identify suitable candidates with due regard to gender balance and the need to balance urban and rural representation.</p>  <p>  As some representative groups were reluctant to join the Committee, I decided to leave one vacancy on the Committee for the time being. I respect the prerogative of those representative groups not to be part of the Committee. Nevertheless, I hope that they reconsider their position in time. Although I will meet these representative groups from time to time on identified issues, the Advisory Committee will continue to be the focus of my engagement with the SPSV sector during this pandemic.</p></reply>

In addition to the announced lay offs for the period, the airline also reported that they will be seeking a number of redundancies. The airline has indicated that such immediate actions and wider structural changes are to address the impact that COVID-19 has had on its operations.</p>  <p>  Both Minister Naughton and I met with their CEO soon after their announcement, and they did confirm that there is no strategic intent to reduce connectivity at Cork Airport, but that the restoration of air services would depend on market conditions. It is clear from my ongoing discussions with Aer Lingus and other aviation stakleholders, that the prority for the industry is clarity around the re-opening of international travel. </p>  <p>  On 28 May, the Government set out its plan for the resumption of non-essential international air travel, scheduled to begin on 19 July. This plan is built around EU Digital COVID Certificates and other proofs of vaccination, pre-departure PCR testing and mandatory quarantine that will allow international travel to operate safely. An &ldquo;emergency brake&rdquo; mechanism will also allow us to respond to the potential emergence of variants of concern.</p>  <p>  On 1 June, Government launched its Economic Recovery Plan 2021 with the goal of achieving rapid job creation and economic growth after the pandemic. This plan sets out new measures for businesses and affected sectors as the economy reopens, and details for existing emergency pandemic financial supports including the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), giving certainty to employers, workers, and for those who need it most.</p>  <p>  While it may take some time for our aviation sector to regain the strong economic position it had at the start of the pandemic, Government has committed to ensuring that there will be no &ldquo;cliff-edge&rdquo; to the COVID-19 related business supports that are currently available, and relevant Departments continue to work on the necessary implementation measures to ensure a safe re-opening of international travel next month.</p></reply>

This Programme, with an available budget of &euro;32.1m, is providing both capital and operational supports to Cork Airport in 2021. </p>  <p>  An application for funding in respect of a significant runway overlay project at Cork Airport is currently being assessed by my Department.  Pending a satisfactory evaluation, I expect this project will be approved for funding in the coming weeks - with an allocation of approximately &euro;10 million.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the capital funding, Cork Airport will also be invited to apply for operational supports, under this Programme, later in the year.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 24 February 2021, my Department secured European Commission approval for a &euro;26 million funding scheme for Irish Airports.  As part of this scheme, a &euro;20m damages measure has been established to support State airports, including Cork.  My Department is currently assessing applications for funding under this measure and aid will be disbursed shortly. </p>  <p>  These direct supports are in addition to the broad range of supports put in place by Government to help mitigate the effects of the crisis.  Cork airport is also availing of the horizontal supports provided by Government including the wage subsidy scheme and commercial rates waiver. </p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to supporting the aviation sector, and we recognise the importance of providing clarity on the extent and duration of supports beyond 2021.  In this context, Government will consider what further supports may be needed to help all regional airports, including Cork and Shannon, as part of the upcoming Estimates process.</p></reply>

TII ultimately delivers the National Roads Programme in line with Project Ireland 2040, the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the NDP.  </p><p>Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the NPF.  This provides the strategic and financial framework for the National Roads Programme for the period 2018 - 2027. </p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to bring forward the review of the NDP and use the review to set out an updated Plan for the period out to 2030. The review of the NDP will be aligned with the NPF and Project Ireland 2040. Accordingly, work is underway within my Department, in conjunction with TII, to contribute to this review. </p><p><b>Developing a series of Bypasses</b></p><p>A comprehensive analysis of the status of all national road projects listed in the current NDP, and new ones proposed by TII to 2030, will be carried out to consider whether changes could feasibly be made to alter the project scope/delivery and projected cost. The strategic transport issues, including those for national roads, are being considered in the context of the ongoing review of the NDP. </p><p>As part of this review, I am focused on prioritising the relief of traffic congestion within towns, facilitating compact growth, decarbonisation and the provision of a robust secondary network of roads between 2021 and 2030. Towns such as Tipperary Town will be considered in this light.</p><p>It should be noted that all projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision to the NDP, require statutory approval and compliance with the Public Spending Code.</p><p><b>N24 - Tipperary Town Bypass</b></p><p>The proposed N24 Cahir to Limerick Junction Improvement Scheme, which would include a bypass of Tipperary Town, is currently at early Planning and Design stage.  </p><p>Tipperary County Council, in association with Limerick City and County Council, has worked to procure the services of Technical Advisors who are now appointed and in-place and working on advancing the scheme. Phase 1 activities (Concept and Feasibility) are complete and the proposed N24 scheme is currently at Phase 2 activities (Option Selection).  </p><p>A Public Consultation on Constraints (obstacles or barriers) to possible routes took place in Quarter 1 2021 informing the Options Selection stage, with the shortlisted transport corridors expected to be unveiled in June 2021. Tipperary County Council has advised TII that the scheme will be going to public consultation on 25th June for a six-week period ending on 6th August 2021.</p></reply>

This Act gives effect to the 1989 International Convention on Salvage of which Ireland is a signatory state and sets out the roles and responsibilities of a number of bodies.  </p>  <p>  Section 40 of the Act provides that the Minister for Transport has the &ldquo;general superintendence&rdquo; of matters relating to wrecked or stranded vessels. The Act also sets out the responsibilities from an operational perspective for other bodies. </p>  <p>  Sections 51 and 52 are of particular note with regard to the duty of the owner and appropriate authorities.</p>  <p>  Section 51 places the initial responsibility for removing a wreck on the owner of the vessel. However, if the appropriate authority, in this case Cork County Council, considers the wreck is or is likely to become an obstruction or danger to navigation or a threat of harm to the marine environment, it shall proceed to raise and remove the wreck or otherwise render it harmless.</p>  <p>  While the Act does allow for the removal of a wreck, it does not contain provisions in relation to the costs associated with the removal of a wreck where the sale of that wreck is not possible, and the owners of the vessel cannot be located. It is understood that no evidence of ownership or insurance has come to light yet in the case referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  As the appropriate authority under the Act, Cork County Council has taken the lead in dealing with the case in question and has taken a number of steps to date in their duties under the Act. </p>  <p>  I understand that my Department received two initial queries from interested parties regarding the removal of the wreck and the parties were advised that they may wish to contact the appropriate authority, in this instance Cork County Council, to discuss the issue.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have met with Cork County Council to discuss the matter and will continue to be available to support relevant authorities in the exercise of their functions as set out in the legislation in question.</p></reply>

Issues in relation toCI&Eacute; pension schemes are primarily a matter for the trustees of the schemes, the CI&Eacute; Group and their employees. </p>  <p>  In relation to the RWS, CI&Eacute; has prepared and submitted draft Statutory Instruments (SIs) to give effect to the proposed changes to the scheme, and these drafts are now being considered by my Department in conjunction with NewERA. </p>  <p>  Concerning the 1951 pension scheme, it is my understanding that this scheme does not currently meet the Minimum Funding Standard (MFS) as required by the Pensions Authority. The MFS is the method the Pensions Authority use to measure whether a scheme has enough assests to cover its obligations with a margin for risk to allow for adverse future experience relating to the scheme's assets and/or liabilities. </p>  <p>  Members of the scheme were recently balloted regarding a Labour Court Recommendation which emerged on 23rd November 2020 and seeks to address the MFS deficit, with a majority of the members voting to accept the proposals. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's question on the reported level of funding of the 1951 scheme, I have been advised by CI&Eacute; that the previously reported figure of 92.3% was released in error. This figure was an estimate which was derived from a high level investment monitoring model and has since been determined to be incorrect. CI&Eacute; have confirmed that the figure of 93.8% for 01/05/2021 is correct. </p>  <p>  I further wish to advise that CI&Eacute; wrote to me on the 26th of May advising that they intend to commence the process of amending the Statutory Instruments to implement the Labour Court Recommendation in relation to the 1951 scheme. I also understand that CI&Eacute; has advised the Pensions Authority and the &lsquo;1951&rsquo; Pension Scheme Trustees and Committee of this development.</p></reply>

As part of this package, the Taskforce recommended that the State should directly provide the airports with a common fixed sum per passenger which will be used by the airports to stimulate traffic by reducing airport charges for airlines and restoring and growing passenger numbers to the regions. </p>  <p>  In response to this and other recommendations of the Taskforce, Government put in place an &euro;80m aviation support package which was announced on 10 November.  This package includes &euro;32.1 million for a new COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme for Shannon (and Cork) Airports.  Under this Programme, Shannon Airport will have access to capital and operational supports in 2021.  In relation to multi-annual CAPEX supports, the Government provided Shannon Airport with &euro;6.1m in emergency capital funding last year and a further &euro;6.3 million in 2021 under  the COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme to date this year.</p>  <p>  Following consultation with the EU Commission, a State aid approved Irish aid Scheme worth &euro;26 million to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was also established. These schemes include compensation for State airports (Dublin, Cork and Shannon) of approximately &euro;20 million, in light of COVID-19 impacts in 2020. This funding will provide State airports, including Shannon Airport, with the flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.  The Department is currently assessing applications for this funding and would hope to be in a position to disburse this compensation in the coming weeks.  In order to ensure parity of treatment, funding will be allocated to airports proportionate to the damage caused.  In this regard, funding will be allocated proportionately in line with 2019 passenger numbers at the airports.   </p>  <p>  Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, the Government has made significant funding available to the Irish aviation industry, including Shannon Airport, through a range of business supports.  The bulk of the support available is through the TWSS/EWSS wage subsidy schemes which were specifically designed to maintain the link between employers and employees. It is estimated that by end-June 2021, the sector will have received approximately &euro;300 million in such supports.</p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan published by Government on 1 June, recognises that additional support may be required to support the aviation sector&rsquo;s recovery as it opens up. </p>  <p>  Finally, any fund administered by Tourism Ireland would be under the remit of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. The transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall carbon emissions, must play a central role in the national decarbonisation effort. The national car and van (LGV) fleet accounts for almost 60% of all land transport emissions, and so a transition to low emissions vehicles, including EVs, is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions.</p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 <i>Climate Action Plan</i>, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years. The Government, supported by the work of the <i>Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce</i>, has worked to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices. A comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base. </p><p>The number of electric cars registered per year is set out in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Type</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021 (to end May)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Battery Electric</td>       <td>1233</td>       <td>3444</td>       <td>4013</td>       <td>3946</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Petrol   PHEV</td>       <td>729</td>       <td>1343</td>       <td>2459</td>       <td>3792</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Diesel   PHEV</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>33</td>       <td>97</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>1972</td>       <td>4790</td>       <td>6505</td>       <td>7835</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department has convened the <i>Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group</i>to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The <i>EVPP Working Group </i>comprises senior officials and has considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales. The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group are being considered at senior level and will be brought to Government shortly.</p></reply>

TII ultimately delivers the National Roads Programme in line with Project Ireland 2040, the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the NDP.</p><p>In that context, TII provides my Department with regular updates on its delivery of the National Roads Programme. The following information is the most up to-date information available to me on TII&rsquo;s delivery of projects on the N26.</p><p><b>Background</b></p><p>Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the NPF.  This provides the strategic and financial framework for the National Roads Programme for the period from 2018 to 2027. The focus of TII's activities is, accordingly, being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes that are included in the NDP, along with the maintenance of the existing national road network.</p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to bring forward the review of the NDP from 2022 and to use the review to set out an updated NDP for the period out to 2030. The review of the NDP will be aligned with the NPF and Project Ireland 2040. Work is underway within my Department to contribute to this review. </p><p>I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight that all projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision to the NDP, require statutory approval and compliance with the Public Spending Code.</p><p><b>Enhanced Regional Accessibility under the NDP</b></p><p>A core priority under the NPF is the essential requirement to enhance and upgrade accessibility between urban centres of population and their regions, in parallel with the initiation of compact growth of urban centres. This has a crucial role to play in maximising the growth potential of the regional urban centres and the economy as a whole. Substantial progress has been made since the year 2000 in improving the road linkages between Dublin and most of the other urban areas and regions. Under the NDP, the objective is to complete those linkages so that every region and all the major urban areas, particularly those in the North-West, are linked to Dublin by a high-quality road network.</p><p>In 2020, there was significant progress in developing new transport links through the appraisal, planning and procurement stages. As set out in Project Ireland 2040, improving access to the north-west is a strategic aim to support balanced national development. The N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin project in Sligo received Government approval on 29 January 2019, with construction ongoing and expected to be complete in late 2021. The N5 Westport to Turlough project in Mayo received Government approval on 15 October 2019 and construction is ongoing. The N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge project received Government approval on 9 June 2021 and is due to commence construction later this summer.</p><p><b>N26 Road Projects</b></p><p>While there are currently no specific projects on the N26 included in the NDP, there is a general commitment for targeted improvements to address bottlenecks and enhance safety on this route. The following are a number of projects that are ongoing on the route to achieve these targeted improvements.</p><p>The construction contract for the Cloongullane Bridge Scheme was awarded in October 2020, and TII provided an allocation of &euro;2.5 million in 2020 and a further allocation of &euro;7 million in 2021 to Mayo County Council to progress this project through construction. </p><p>An allocation of &euro;50,000 was provided to the Council in 2020 for the preparation of a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for the proposed link road between the N26 and N59. The SAR was approved by my Department in March 2021 and TII have provided an allocation of &euro;100,000 in 2021 to progress this minor safety scheme through the early planning and design phases.</p></reply>

This investment will help support the planned delivery of almost 1,000 kilometres of improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025 as well as additional investment in Greenways.</p>  <p>  The year 2021 has therefore seen a significant increase in my Department's funding for cycling and walking, in line with the Government&rsquo;s prioritisation of Active Travel and Greenways. As well as an increased allocation of &euro;240 million administered through the National Transport Authority (NTA) to Active Travel projects in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area and the four regional cities and over &euro;50 million to the Department's Greenways programme, I was delighted to announce earlier this year an additional &euro;72.8 million to projects in the 19 remaining local authorities. </p>  <p>  This funding stream constitutes the first ever major Active Travel investment programme for rural Ireland, and amounts to more than the entire Active Travel budget for 2019. A full list of programmes being funded can be found on the NTA website. The overall increase in funding across urban and rural Ireland will not only support the construction and improvement of safe and connected walking and cycling infrastructure but also the deployment of almost 250 dedicated Active Travel staff in local authorities around the country.</p>  <p>  In addition to the increased funding for walking and cycling infrastructure, a number of smaller-scale initiatives are being progressed by my Department to support and promote efforts to increase safe Active Travel across the country. The Department of Transport funds the delivery of CycleRight training through Cycling Ireland, which delivers cycling training to school-children around the country and equips them with the skills to cycle safely. </p>  <p>  In partnership with the Department of Education we also launched the Safe Routes to Schools Programme earlier this year, which aims to accelerate the delivery of safe walking, scooting and cycling infrastructure on key access routes to schools. It has had a great response, with applications received from schools in every county in Ireland, and I expect to be in a position to announce the first round of funding under this programme before the end of this month.  </p>  <p>  The step-change in funding committed in Budget 2021 and the introduction of various innovative measures to encourage safe and connected Active Travel is proof of the Government's commitment to this area, and I look forward to the delivery of the numerous projects and programmes around the country, including in rural areas.</p></reply>

The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the Free Travel Scheme.  In Budget 2020, and prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, a total of &euro;304 million was provided for PSO and Local Link rural regular services.  Due to the impact of Covid-19, which resulted in the collapse of fare revenue on public transport, a further &euro;370 million was allocated to enable the continued operation of public transport services in 2020.

Pursuant to this key requirement, Article 4 of the Regulation specifies that a Transport Manager designated by a road transport operator must: </p><p>- Effectively and continuously manage the transport activities of the undertaking;</p><p>- Have a genuine link to the licensed undertaking or otherwise be entitled under contract to carry out duties as Transport Manager on behalf of the undertaking;</p><p>- Be of good repute;</p><p>- Be resident in the Community</p><p>- Hold a Transport Manager Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) issued by a competent authority of the EU.</p><p>As outlined by the European Commission (see the notification available at ), following the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020 a Transport Manager CPC issued by a competent authority in the UK, including Northern Ireland, is no longer valid in the EU.  This means that a Transport Manager holding a UK-issued CPC can no longer act as Transport Manager for an EU-based road transport operator. </p><p>My Department received clarification in late November 2020 from the European Commission that holders of a UK Transport Manager CPC could request a corresponding certificate from the competent authority in the Member State where they live or where the road transport operator employing them is established, as long as the request was submitted before the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020.  My Department wrote to all UK (including Northern Ireland) Transport Manager CPC holders working for Irish road transport operators to inform them of this position, urging them to apply for a corresponding Irish (EU) certificate. </p><p>As the deadline has now passed for applying for a corresponding Irish Transport Manager CPC, any persons who wish to act as Transport Manager for an Irish/EU operator must obtain a Transport Manager CPC issued by an EU Member State. Obtaining an Irish Transport Manager CPC requires passing the examination administered by the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) on behalf of my Department. </p><p>Candidates who already hold a UK-issued Transport Manager CPC will not be required to undertake the training course of 100 hours that is normally mandatory before taking the examination.  The next dates for the CILT Transport Manager CPC examination are 30 June and 24 November and candidates can register online with CILT for the examination (contact info@cilt.ie). </p><p>Alternatively, a licensed operator whose current Transport Manager holds a UK-issued Transport Manager CPC may contract a suitably qualified person as a designated replacement in the role of Transport Manager.</p><p>Affected road transport operators have been granted a period of six months under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 in which to take appropriate remedial action.  </p><p>The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include provision for mutual recognition of the Transport Manager CPC.  It should be noted that the Transport Manager CPC qualification affords access to the wider single market. </p><p>Persons wishing to act as Transport Manager for a road transport operator established in an EU Member State, including in Ireland, must be resident in the EU in line with Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009.  Given the particular situation on the island of Ireland, my Department sought clarification on this residency requirement from the European Commission, and it has been confirmed that the requirement stands.</p></reply>

This Code is being  developed by a working group of stakeholders including representatives of the farming representative bodies. It is dealing with issues such as agreeing the consultation process, the factors to be considered when choosing a route, appropriate types of accommodation works, appropriate levels of payment for land, suitable types of access both for landowners and the public, ways of minimising severance, the range of possible mitigation and accommodation works and mechanisms to minimise disruption and to ensure the smooth and timely delivery of Greenway projects.

Private vehicles are the biggest emitting segment; as such, providing meaningful alternatives to everyday car journeys, especially in our cities, is fundamental to achieving our climate objectives.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the <i>Climate Action Plan </i>(<i>CAP</i>) <i>2021</i>is currently being developed; as part of this process my Department has carried out analytical and modelling work to identify the various measures required to achieve a 51% reduction in transport emissions by 2030. <i>CAP 2021</i>will be published later this summer and will contain several key actions to decarbonise the transport sector, including those related to modal shift and managing demand for private car use. Regarding modal shift targets, the <i>CAP 2019</i>aimed for an additional 500,000 sustainable journeys in the transport system by 2035, I expect that under <i>CAP 2021</i>this ambition level will be raised further. </p><p>For this reason, continued and enhanced investment in sustainable mobility options is needed. The implementation of major public transport projects such as BusConnects, Connecting Ireland, the expansion of rail services and infrastructure, as well as a significant increase in our cycling and walking spending will be pivotal in fostering more sustainable trips. Achieving modal shift will be supported through the new 10-year <i>Sustainable Mobility Policy</i>which will be published later this year.  The new <i>Policy</i>will include actions in the areas of behaviour change, demand management, and transport-led development, including multi-modal transport hubs to deliver modal shift and greater use of sustainable modes of transport. </p><p>In tandem, to promoting more sustainable travel modes we need to lessen car kilometres driven if we are to achieve the required 51% reduction in transport emissions. This is not about cancelling trips, but rather it is about reducing the need for and length of certain trips. Planning policy will continue to work to address low density/suburban sprawl, which increases the distance people must travel and ultimately can lock in car-dependent patterns of behaviour. Reducing car journeys offers many co-benefits in terms of citizen health, reducing congestion, and facilitating more accessible and vibrant communities. </p><p>In this regard, I am fully committed to exploring every means possible to shift towards low-carbon, affordable, and accessible mobility.</p></reply>

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to support continuation of PSO services during the Covid situation in 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the situation of the licenced bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.</p>  <p>  Therefore, last June the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  The Expressway business operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the many commercial operations of licenced public transport services that have been able to avail of this new, temporary, Covid-related support.</p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department, entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.  </p>  <p>  As it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on 26 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter.

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys. </p>  <p>  In order to support the continued operation of public transport services throughout the crisis, despite the reduced demand and the restricted capacity owing to the Covid-19 situation, the Government is spending considerable additional Exchequer funds on the public transport sector. Government support for all public transport services in 2020 amounted to over &euro;620m.  By comparison, the level of PSO and Local Link funding provided in 2019 was in the region of &euro;300m. The 2021 Exchequer allocation for PSO is just below &euro;659m.</p>  <p>  Further, last June the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  The Expressway business operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the many commercial operations of licenced public transport services that have been able to avail of this new, temporary, Covid-related support.</p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department, entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.  </p>  <p>  As it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on 26 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. The NTA, following consultation with operators, has recently finalised a review of the scheme and as a result some changes to services have been implemented. </p>  <p>  As transport accounts for a little over 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions, there can be no doubt that the sector has a vital role to play in our national decarbonisation efforts. Providing meaningful alternatives to everyday car journeys, especially in our cities, is fundamental to achieving our climate objectives. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan (CAP) 2021 will be published later this summer and will contain several key transport decarbonisation actions relating to modal shift and managing demand for private car use. Regarding modal shift targets, the CAP 2019 aimed for an additional 500,000 sustainable journeys in the transport system by 2035, and I expect that under CAP 2021 this ambition level will be raised further. </p>  <p>  The current Programme for Government (PfG) sets out an ambitious and wide-ranging set of commitments in relation to public transport investment. These commitments will provide viable alternatives to car transport to reduce congestion and emissions, and enable the transport sector to cater for the demands associated with longer-term population and employment growth in a sustainable manner.</p>  <p>  The implementation of major public transport projects such as BusConnects, Connecting Ireland, the expansion of rail services and infrastructure, as well as a significant increase in our cycling and walking spending will be pivotal in fostering more sustainable trips. </p>  <p>  An important element of Ireland&rsquo;s climate action is the move toward low-emission vehicles. Under the National Development Plan (NDP), the NTA committed to no longer purchasing diesel-only urban buses from July 2019. To date, a total of 280 diesel-electric hybrid buses have been ordered, of which 100 should be operational by May 2021, with the remainder to be delivered before year end. The NTA is also tendering for both single and double-deck full electric town buses and piloting electric vehicles in rural areas under the Local Link programme.</p>  <p>  Achieving modal shift will be supported through the new 10-year Sustainable Mobility Policy, which will be published later this year.  The new Policy will include actions in the areas of behaviour change, demand management, and transport-led development, including multi-modal transport hubs to deliver modal shift and greater use of sustainable modes of transport.</p>  <p>  In tandem to promoting more sustainable travel modes, we need to lessen car kilometres driven if we are to achieve the required 51% reduction in transport emissions. This is not about cancelling trips, but rather it is about reducing the need for and length of certain trips. Planning policy will continue to work to address low-density/suburban sprawl, which increases the distance people must travel and ultimately can lock in car-dependent patterns of behaviour. Increasing sustainable and active journeys offers many co-benefits in terms of citizen health, reducing congestion, and facilitating more accessible and vibrant communities.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I am fully committed to exploring every means possible to shift towards low-carbon, affordable, and accessible mobility.</p></reply>

However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport.</p>  <p>  On January 29, I met with a local community organisation, the North Tipperary Community Rail Partnership (NTCRP), to discuss a number of issues which it wished to raise in relation to services on the Ballybrophy line. Following that meeting, NTA representatives attended a meeting of Nenagh Municipal District on 18 February, at which representatives of NTCRP presented the case for improved infrastructure and additional services for the Ballybrophy rail line. </p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann also held a meeting with the NTCRP on March 9 in relation to the Ballybrophy line. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann stated that its priority at this time was the restoration of services to pre-COVID-19 levels. </p>  <p>  My Department has been advised by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that, following the completion of the relaying of 5 miles of continuous welded rail on the line, it will run an empty train Limerick-Ballybrophy-Limerick on Sunday in preparation for all services to return to normal on Monday morning 21st June as planned.  In addition, I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are to reschedule a recently postponed meeting with the NTCRP at a time that suits all concerned. I understand the issues of concern to NTCRP and referred to by the Deputy will again form part of those discussions.</p>  <p>  In relation to the X8 bus route - both the National Transport Authority (NTA) and my Department have been engaging directly with commercial bus operators throughout the Covid-19 Emergency. The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to support continuation of PSO services during the Covid situation in 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the situation of the licenced bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.</p>  <p>  Therefore, last June the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  The Expressway business operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the many commercial operations of licenced public transport services that have been able to avail of this new, temporary, Covid-related support.</p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.

This evidence based, plan-led transport planning will, I believe, allow the regional cities to grow in a sustainable and compact manner, as informed by the National Planning Framework and the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies.</p>  <p>  There has already been substantial progress in relation to rail in the regional cities.  A feasibility study has been undertaken in Galway in relation to proposed improvements along the Athenry to Galway corridor and investment announced under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) to support infrastructure works at Oranmore station and improvement at Ceannt Station.  URDF funding has also been announced to support the movement of Waterford&rsquo;s Plunkett Station to the North Quays.  In Limerick, options are being considered for the enhancement of rail services in the city region as part of the development of its metropolitan area transport strategy, while in Cork, the start of a major investment in the metropolitan rail network for the city was recently announced as part of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan.</p>  <p>  I believe our policy for the regional cities must be to encourage transport-led development along high-capacity public transport corridors, including our commuter rail networks.  This can allow for the development of sustainable and well-connected communities where active travel becomes the preferred mode of travel for many localised journeys and good quality public transport is available to facilitate longer journeys into the major urban centres.</p></reply>

It was clear from my discussions that the priority for Aer Lingus, and for all aviation stakeholders, is clarity on plans for re-opening international travel.</p><p>On 28 May, the Government  set out its plan for the resumption of non-essential international air travel, with effect from 19 July. This plan is built around EU Digital COVID Certificates and other proofs of vaccination, pre-departure PCR testing and mandatory quarantine that will allow international travel to operate safely. An &ldquo;emergency brake&rdquo; mechanism will also allow us to respond to the potential emergence of variants of concern. The plan includes a framework for the safe return of air travel from US and other third country routes.</p><p>On 1 June, Government launched its Economic Recovery Plan 2021 with the goal of achieving rapid job creation and economic growth after the pandemic. This plan sets out new measures for businesses and affected sectors as the economy reopens, and details for existing emergency pandemic financial supports including the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), giving certainty to employers, workers, and for those who need it most.</p><p>My officials and I have maintained regular contact with key stakeholders throughout this crisis, and Government has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including the aviation sector. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the SBCI Working Capital Scheme. It is estimated that, by the end of June this year, our airlines and airports will have received at least &euro;300 million from several available supports. Liquidity funding is also available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund for medium and large enterprises. </p><p>While it may take some time for our aviation sector to regain the strong economic position it had at the start of the pandemic, Government has committed to ensuring that there will be no &ldquo;cliff-edge&rdquo; to the COVID-19 related business supports that are currently available.</p><p>As regards the Heathrow slots, Aer Lingus entered into certain commitments at the time of its acquisition by IAG in 2015 in relation to the operation of its London Heathrow slots. These commitments are, however, subject to certain <i>force majeure </i>provisions,  which are defined to include an &quot;epidemic or pandemic&quot;. The reduction in Aer Lingus frequencies to London Heathrow is therefore in accordance with these provisions.</p></reply>

This move toward evidence based, plan-led transport planning for our major cities is to be welcomed and allows for consideration of all relevant issues and the potential role all modes of transport can play in addressing those issues. I would also note that providing this type of long-term investment framework represents international best practice in the area of transport planning. </p>  <p>  I would also point out that the National Transpoirt Authority (NTA) works collaboratively with local authorities outside the Galway Metropolitan Area on a regular basis. It has worked successfully on an administrative, non-statutory basis to assist several local authorities across the North Western region in preparing transport related strategies or implementing transport related projects.</p>  <p>  I am eager to see progress on the delivery of the Galway Transport Strategy and welcome the non-statutory consultations held last year on two of the key Galway BusConnects corridors. I look forward to the delivery of much improved active travel infrastructure in the next few years as well as improvements to the commuter rail network, such as the proposals in relation to Ceannt Station, Oranmore Station and indeed the Athenry to Galway rail corridor generally. I note that as it is now six years since the publication of the Galway Transport Strategy a review is likely warranted and I believe that such a review could commence next year. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is undertaking a Strategic Rail Review.  This Review, for which my Department in consultation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland and relevant Stakeholders such as Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Translink and the National Transport Authority developed the terms of reference, will be on an all-island rail network basis.</p>  <p>  The Review will consider all issues in relation to inter-urban and inter-regional rail connectivity, including the potential for high-/higher speed(s), rail freight and, the Deputy may wish to note, improved connectivity to the North-West.  This will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and will provide a framework to develop a much-improved rail network in the years ahead.  </p>  <p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, work in the Review should commence in the summer and while the ultimate duration of the review will be determined by the work programmes submitted by tenderers, it is a requirement of the published request for tender that the work take no longer than 12 months in total.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP), which is currently being reviewed, sets out the current funding provision and the priorities for development. The NDP names the major projects that are to be progressed within the period of the plan and TII delivers on these projects with its local authority partners in so far as funding, resources, processes and procedure allows.</p>  <p>  Projects are also delivered under the requirements of the public spending code and project business cases are assessed at the relevant decision gates, based on the scheme objectives, including regional development and connectivity, amongst other objectives.  </p>  <p>On the smaller projects, such as pavement and safety, these projects are selected based on national reviews and on a needs basis.</p></reply>

Accounting for a little over one fifth of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, there can be no question but that transport must feature strongly in contributing towards the national decarbonisation effort. As such, I welcome the recent report from the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action on reducing emissions in the transport sector by 51% by 2030. Indeed, the publication is very timely given that both the <i>Climate Action Plan </i>and <i>National Development Plan </i>are currently undergoing review. The Committee&rsquo;s report provides a strong evidence base to assist in the development of these two key <i>Plans.</i></p><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that a transformational change is required to achieve a carbon free transport sector by 2050 and more imminently to halve emissions over the next decade. In preparation for the<i>Climate Action Plan</i>, my Department has conducted significant analytical and modelling work to help identify the nature and scale of measures required to achieve the step-up in emissions reduction. Preliminary findings of this analysis align closely with the conclusions of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, particularly in relation to promoting more sustainable trips, managing travel demand, achieving greater EV penetration as well as needing to decarbonise the hard-to-abate freight sector.</p><p>I am committed to giving due consideration to all 47 recommendations from the Committee&rsquo;s Report, including those relating to public transport fare structures, to chart an informed course to reduce transport emissions in line with our <i>Programme for Government</i>commitment. The Deputy should note that as the National Transport Authority has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services, any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for them in the first instance.  I have, therefore, forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

This will require significant investment in our infrastructure and services and the <i>Programme for Government - Our Shared Future</i>commits toward such a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland and I look forward to seeing the change occur in the coming years. </p><p>I am also clear that within our sustainable mobility sector, or more particularly within public transport, we need to transition toward low-emission and zero-emission fleets in line with available technologies. </p><p>In rail, the key focus has been to expand electrification through the DART+ programme of investment which, once completed, will mean around 70% of passenger journeys across the rail network will be on electrified services.  This will represent a significant shift from the position of today. The scope to electrify rail services in the other cities has been, or is being, considered their metropolitan area transport strategies are developed.</p><p>In terms of inter-urban rail, which is a much smaller component of total annual passenger journeys as compared to that covered by the DART+ programme, I have stated my commitment to conduct a <i>Strategic Rail Review </i>and it is my intention that one of the issues that Review will consider will be future decarbonisation of the inter-city / inter-regional networks. I would note that there is no settled perspective on this matter in a European context, as evidenced by the EU&rsquo;s recently published <i>Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy </i>which references the requirement for further electrification but also notes that electrification may not be viable in all cases.

For this reason, our aviation policy places a priority on international connectivity. The sector is experiencing the most challenging crisis in its history, with many analysts predicting that it will take several years for it to return to 2019 levels of activity.</p>  <p>  All service providers in the sector, apart from those substantially or exclusively dedicated to air cargo, have had no option but to radically address their cost base and seek to safeguard liquidity. Alongside rationalisation measures, the major service providers are shoring up their finances through increased borrowings or raising new capital.</p>  <p>  Several public health measures have been introduced in relation to international travel, which have developed and evolved as the pandemic has progressed, with the objective of both limiting the spread of COVID-19 and limiting the presence of its variants of concern in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The main requirement of all aviation stakeholders has been clarity from Government on a plan to permit the resumption of non-essential international air travel, and the Government outlined such a plan on 28 May, which is scheduled to begin on 19 July. This plan brings together the EU Digital COVID Certificates, pre-departure PCR testing, mandatory quarantine, and our public health measures so that international travel can operate safely. An &ldquo;emergency brake&rdquo; mechanism will also allow us to respond to the potential emergence of variants of concern.</p>  <p>  While it may take some time for our aviation sector to regain the strong economic position it had at the start of the pandemic, Government has committed to ensuring that there will be no &ldquo;cliff-edge&rdquo; to the COVID-19 related business supports that are currently available. On 1 June, Government launched its Economic Recovery Plan 2021 with the goal of achieving rapid job creation and economic growth after the pandemic. This plan sets out new measures for businesses and affected sectors as the economy reopens, and details for existing emergency pandemic financial supports including the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), giving certainty to employers, workers, and for those who need it most. Importantly, this plan also recognised that additional support may be required for the recovery of the aviation sector.</p>  <p>  With our vaccination programme progressing, a plan for the resumption of non-essential international travel ready and significant levels of business supports available, aviation is now positioned to begin to recover.</p></reply>

In this context the Department held a public consultation process between November 2019 and February 2020, and included a stakeholder event in the course of that consultation. Over 250 submissions were received as part of this public consultation process and I published a report of the public consultation.</p>  <p>  I intend to develop a new policy framework for the next 10 years that can provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the sustainable mobility programme. The new policy statement will be informed by the review of the previous policy framework (known as Smarter Travel), submissions received during my Department's consultation process and the views and recommendations of other relevant stakeholders. It will provide a platform to advance the ambitions of the Programme for Government in the area of sustainable mobility.</p>  <p>  Our committments in both the Programme for Government and "Our Rural Future" in relation to public transport in rural areas will be progressed in the context of that new policy statement. Among the measures we will prioritise is a Sustainable Rural Mobility Plan to ensure settlements over a certain size can connect to the national public transport system, expanding the Local Link rural transport service and prioritising public transport projects that enhance regional and rural connectivity. </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.  The NTA also has responsibility for local and rural transport, including the management of Rural Transport Programme (RTP) which operates under the Local Link brand.  </p>  <p>  The NTA has undertaken a nationwide study to inform its approach to rolling out improved public transport across the country (excluding the GDA, Regional Cities and Large Towns) by providing better connections between villages and towns by linking them with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide.</p>  <p>  Arising from this study, I am advised that the NTA has now completed the first phase of consultation on its proposals, titled 'Connecting Ireland', with all Local Authorities and is now engaging with Regional Authorities and other key stakeholders. This will be followed by a wider public consultation in Q3 2021 prior to finalisation of the proposals by the NTA and submission to my Department.</p></reply>

The <i>Strategy </i>adopts the multi-modal approach to transport planning that has proven successful in many city regions internationally; it provides the necessary evidence-based, and plan-led framework that can guide investment in Cork over the short, medium and longer term. This type of approach is exactly the type of long-term planning needed to ensure effective transport access.</p><p>The <i>CMATS</i>has a number of significant public transport proposals across bus, commuter rail and light rail together with the proposed transformation of active travel infrastructure in the city region. I am glad to say there are a number of important steps already in progress in this regard.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the <i>CMATS</i>involves the delivery of a BusConnects Cork programme of improved bus and active travel infrastructure and a redesigned network of bus services. </p><p>Complementing this investment, it is also proposed to develop a light rail service running on an east to west corridor across the city and, in advance of its introduction, BusConnects Cork will deliver a high-capacity, high-frequency bus corridor along the route. </p><p>Route options analysis has started on both the BusConnects infrastructure project and the light rail proposal, while work has also started on the BusConnects network redesign.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that a &euro;185 million investment in Cork&rsquo;s commuter rail network project was recently announced as part of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP).  The transport component of the NRRP comprises an investment in Cork's rail network to support the longer-term objective to provide electrified rail services in the Cork metropolitan area, as set out in the <i>CMATS</i>. This is the largest single project proposed for inclusion in the NRRP and consists of the following works:</p><p>- Construction of a new &lsquo;through&rsquo; platform within Kent Station to create a suburban rail network between Mallow, Midleton and Cobh;</p><p>- Re-signalling of the suburban rail network (62km of track); and</p><p>- Double-tracking of current single track between Glounthaune and Midleton (approximately 6 - 8km).</p><p>In line with the requirements set by the European Union for inclusion within recovery and resilience plans all works should be completed by end 2026, while it is expected that the works at Kent Station should be completed by end 2024.</p><p>I hope the Deputy can see that we are progressing with implementation of the <i>CMATS </i>and expanding sustainable mobility options in Cork city.</p></reply>

I can advise the Deputy that the Department of Health in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach are continuing the work to ensure Ireland is in a position to comply with the EUDCC as required.</p><p>From 19 July, subject to the prevailing public health situation, Ireland will implement new arrangements for travel to ireland based on the EU Digital COVID Certificate (DCC).  A DCC will show if a passenger is vaccinated against COVID-19; has recovered from COVID-19; or has a negative test result.</p><p>Passengers arriving into Ireland from an EU/EEA Member State with a DCC will not have to undergo quarantine. However, passengers with a DCC based on a non-PCR test (for example, an antigen test), or those arriving without a DCC, will require proof of a negative RT-PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before arrival.</p><p>Children aged between 7 and 18 who have not been vaccinated must also have a negative RT-PCR test.</p><p>A passenger who has been in a non-EU/EEA country in the 14 days prior to arrival into Ireland will be subject to the rules applying to travel from that country which, in some cases, may require quarantine at a designated hotel.</p><p>All passengers will be advised to observe public health restrictions and to present for post-arrival testing if they develop symptoms of COVID-19.</p><p>It is important to note that the EU DCC is not a travel document. The possession of an EU DCC will not be a precondition to travel.  Individual Member States will determine how the DCC will be used as part of national public health measures.</p><p>Furthermore, from 19 July, Ireland will also broadly align itself to the EU approach to non-essential travel into the EU from third countries (outside EU/EEA). </p><p>To protect its citizens against the importation of variants, an &lsquo;emergency brake&rsquo; mechanism will be coordinated at EU level to react swiftly to the emergence of a variant of concern or variant of interest.</p></reply>

Since the impacts of the crisis on international travel became apparent in March last year, particularly on sectors such as aviation and the outbound travel trade, officials from my Department have liaised closely with the Irish Travel Agents Association, which represents about half of the licensed travel agents in the country. My officials have also maintained close contact with travel counsellors and some of the larger tour operators in Ireland during this period. I attended a video conference with the ITAA last summer, and more recently I joined Minister Ryan at a meeting with them in February. </p>  <p>  The Government has provided an unprecedented package of supports to businesses during the crisis most of which have been available to the licensed travel agents and tour operators. The sector has availed of some of those central Government supports such as the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme, which has undoubtedly helped sustain employment in the sector.  Travel agents and tour operators have also qualified for the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) or the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) which fall under the remit of my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment respectively. </p>  <p>  In addition, in June 2020 my Department, in close consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, introduced the Refund Credit Note (RCN) Scheme.  This scheme was devised in full consultation between my officals and those representing the T&aacute;naiste's Department, with the industry as represented by the ITAA. The Scheme is in line with the EU Commission recommendations of May 2020 in assisting the liquidity positions of licensed travel agents and tour operators by ensuring that refund vouchers are protected in the event of insolvency. The Scheme has undoubtedly assisted in preserving cash within the sector, To date Notes to the value of &euro;17m have been issued. This is money that otherwise would have had to be paid by the sector to cover customer refunds.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, following representations from the travel trade my Department has recently liaised with merchant service providers in the context of their approach to risk profiling and requirements for security from the travel industry. The key concerns of the service providers were addressed with the cooperation of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, the body that licenses Irish travel trade firms and I am assured that the service providers have responded positively to this development.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the pandemic I have maintained contact with relevant Government colleagues in respect to the needs of this sector, in particular from a small business perspective about the eligibility criteria for certain COVID related business support schemes. I welcomed the T&aacute;naiste's recent announcement that eligibility for the SBASC would be extended to include travel counsellors, a cohort of travel agents that work from home. </p>  <p>  Under the Government's Resilience and Recovery: The Path Ahead Plan, non-essential international travel will be possible from 19 July. This plan is built around the EU Digital COVID Certificates and other proofs of vaccination, pre-departure PCR testing and mandatory quarantine that will allow international travel to operate safely while an &ldquo;emergency brake&rdquo; mechanism will also allow us to respond to the potential emergence of variants of concern.</p>  <p>  Whilst there will be a certain level of pent-up demand, it is recognised that it may take some time for consumer confidence to return and for the sector to see a meaningful return to trade.</p>  <p>  On 1 June, Government launched its Economic Recovery Plan 2021 with the goal of achieving rapid job creation and economic growth after the pandemic. This plan sets out new measures for businesses and affected sectors as the economy reopens, and details for continuing existing emergency pandemic financial supports including the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), giving certainty to employers and employees. Importantly, this plan also recognises that additional support may be required for the recovery of certain sectors such as aviation and travel trade. As the travel trade is part of the wider aviation and travel ecosystem, the needs of this particular sector will continue to be considered and I and my Department will maintain contact with the industry in the weeks ahead, as we get more clarity on the trajectory of the recovery of the economy which is, of course, now finding its feet again as we start to reopen for business.</p></reply>

In recognition of these impacts Government put in place a range of horizontal economy wide supports which Shannon Group is availing of as appropriate. These include both wage supports and the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) which have recently been extended by Government.</p>  <p>  In addition, on 10 November 2020, in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the aviation sector, the Government announced an &euro;80 million funding package for Irish aviation in 2021.  Shannon Airport will receive support under both the &euro;32.1m Covid-19 Regional State Airports Programme 2021 and the &euro;26m Covid-19 Supplementary Supports Schemes. These schemes include compensation for State Airports including Shannon Airport and will provide State airports with flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.  My Department is currently assessing applications for this funding under this Scheme and would hope to be in a position to disburse this compensation in the coming weeks.  In order to ensure parity of treatment, funding will be allocated to airports proportionate to the damage caused.  In this regard, funding will be allocated proportionately in line with 2019 passenger numbers at the airports.  </p>  <p>  On 19th April 2021, the allocation of over &euro;11 million in Exchequer funding was announced under the Covid-19 Regional State Airports Programme, of which &euro;6.3m was allocated to Shannon Airport.  These aviation specific supports follow the Government's approval of &euro;6.1m to Shannon Airport in 2020 to ensure completion of the Airport's Hold Baggage Screening project.  </p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic, Shannon Group was delivering on its commercial mandate, improving profitability and recording strong growth in its commercial property company. Shannon Group must be afforded the opportunity to return to that pre-COVID-19 value proposition and through the various supports referenced above, I believe Shannon Airport will be positioned for recovery. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that Ryanair resumed scheduled air services in Shannon Airport on 1 June. Regarding the restoration of other routes and the introduction of new air services, these are commercial matters between airlines and airports, including Shannon Airport.</p></reply>

Public transport&rsquo;s designation as an essential service throughout the pandemic means that, although fare revenues have collapsed, most of the cost of operations remains and must continue to be met in order to fulfil Government&rsquo;s broader policy objectives.  </p>  <p>  In Budget 2020, and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately &euro;300 million was provided for Public Service Obligation (PSO) and Local Link services. However, due to the impact that the COVID-19 crisis had on the sector, with passenger numbers falling to below 10% of 2019 levels at the height of the restrictions, a further c. &euro;370 million was provided in 2020 to enable the continued operation of public transport services, with the COVID support scheme for commercial operators (CBO) amounting to an additional &euro;32.3m and the Rural Transport Programme funding requirement for COVID-19 related expenditure, including for enhanced cleaning regime, additional fleet to address capacity issues and loss of fare revenue amounting to a further &euro;0.4m. Therefore, total PSO and Local Link expenditure in 2020 was &euro;670m compared to &euro;300m in 2019.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;2,699,376.46 was spent on COVID-19 PSO Maritime supports.</p>  <p>  Measures to control the Coronavirus epidemic had practically stopped passenger traffic on combined Passenger/Roll-on Roll-off ferries on the Southern and Continental routes to and from Ireland. This passenger revenue is necessary for the operations&rsquo; economic viability.  Because of this, it became clear that urgent measures were necessary to assist in the continuation of Roll-On Roll Off freight transport on these services over the next few months.</p>  <p>  On 7 April 2020, the Government announced the temporary designation of five strategic maritime routes into and out of Ireland as Public Service Obligation (PSO) routes during COVID-19 for a period of up to three months.  These routes are Dublin/Cherbourg and Rosslare/Fishguard, Pembroke, Cherbourg and Bilbao. The Government also approved the emergency provision of a maximum contribution of &euro;15m toward the costs involved in the continued operation of passenger ferry services on these routes in the three month period. </p>  <p>  The five routes in question are of strategic importance to Ireland because they ensure the robustness and resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s lifeline supply chain which is critically important at this time for the movement of goods, including food and medical supplies, into and out of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department entered into PSO Agreements with two companies to operate three of the designated routes. A final total of &euro;2,699,376.46 was drawn down from this fund.</p>  <p>  EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2015/1998 requires the upgrade of security screening equipment at European airports to improve explosive detection in hold baggage.  To ensure compliance with this Regulation, a HBS project is currently underway at Shannon Airport.  </p>  <p>  Government approved Exchequer funding of &euro;6.1 million in June 2020 to assist in the completion of this project at Shannon Airport, which had been suspended due to the impacts of COVID.  Of the Exchequer funds available, &euro;303K was drawn down in 2020 and a further &euro;2.47 million has been drawn down to date in 2021.  The balance of funds are expected to be drawn down upon completion of the project by years end.</p>  <p>  The total COVID related spend in the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of my Department was just over &euro;9, 000.  This was primarily spent on personal protective equipment (PPE).  Procurement of the additional PPE assisted the MSO to continue providing statutory services during the COVID restrictions.</p>  <p>  The provision of antigen testing services for commercial vehicle drivers travelling to certain other EU countries amounted to &euro;1,264,500 and self-isolation accommodation for non-resident drivers that tested positive for COVID-19 amounted to &euro;84,000. </p>  <p>  In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Irish Coast Guard spent in the region of &euro;190,000. This included spend on PPE (FFP2, surgical and barrier type facemasks, gloves, tychem &amp;amp; tyvek suits), hand sanitiser, disinfectant, supply and fitting of vehicle partitions, thermometers, posters/signage, automatic hand sanitiser dispensers, and mobile handwashing basins. The spend to date in 2021 is being compiled at present, and will be furnished to the Deputy without delay.</p>  <p>  The Department allocated &euro;1.9m for payments for overseas travel repatriation and refund. The funds are administered by the Commission for Aviation Regulation.</p>  <p>  My Department facilitated the initial setting up by daa of a call centre in relation to the passenger locator forms under the responsibility of the Department of Health. The &euro;45,843.15 paid involved payment of the cost of legal advice.</p>  <p>  A total sum of &euro;3,315.46 (inclusive of VAT) was spent by my Department relating to COVID-19 communications to the public. This was for the provision of information leaflets for distribution, over the Christmas travel period, to passengers on board ferries to Ireland and also to passengers on arrival in Irish airports, to advise them of COVID-19 requirements in this country at the time. This sum included a small sum for the translation of the leaflet into Irish.</p>  <p>  My Department also spent &euro;503,451.78 on IT related equipment, Health and Safety measures, PPE, signage and other COVID-19 related items.</p></reply>

This Network will comprise Greenways, other off road cycle routes, lower trafficked roads, and will build on the work of the National Transport Authority (NTA) in the GDA Cycle Network Plan and the Regional Cities Cycle Network plans. </p>  <p>  Under the Strategy for the Future Development of Regional and Local Greenways, &euro;40m was invested by the previous Government in 2019 to co-fund nine construction-ready Greenways. This co-funding was significantly increased following my appointment as Minister in 2020 to one hundred per cent Exchequer funding with a total allocation to these projects of &euro;76m. The total allocation for Greenways in 2021 is over &euro;63m which is the highest single year figure for Greenways by some margin.</p>  <p>  My Department has continued to co-support cross-border Greenways under the EU Interreg V programme, including the Carlingford to Newry Greenway on the East Coast.</p>  <p>  In 2020 my Department allocated &euro;4.5m in co-funding for 26 pre-construction phase projects, including Preliminary Design and Environmental Evaluation for a 12.3 km section from the Tourist Office in Carlingford to Templetown Beach. This will provide us with a pipeline of projects that will come to construction over the coming years and see us achieve the goal set out in the Greenways Strategy of increasing the number and geographical spread of Greenways around the country.</p>  <p>  In relation to planned routes outlined in the Greater Dublin Area Cycle Network Plan that would potentially form part of the East Coast Greenway, this document was prepared in 2013 by the NTA and I will therefore refer the Deputy&rsquo;s query to the NTA for a more detailed reply.

In relation to shared car schemes specifically, these are principally market-driven initiatives which are supported by local authorities through a variety of means such as access to on-street parking. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is likely aware that my Department is currently carrying out a review of sustainable mobility policy. Since the end of the public consultation last year, it has analysed more than 250 submissions that were received, and a report of that consultation process was published on the Departmental website. That report provides an overview of the types of stakeholder who engaged with the consultation process and summarises the different thematic areas raised, including car-sharing and bike-sharing. </p>  <p>  In that report the Deputy will see a number of ideas were submitted with regard to promoting shared mobility schemes. The Deputy will also see that there were different views expressed in relation to the regulation of such schemes ranging from those advocating a very permissive regulatory framework to others who argued that good quality regulation would be crucial to guarantee safety, address environmental concerns and ensure consumer protection.</p>  <p>  Following the public consultation, my Department is now developing a new 10-year Sustainable Mobility Policy which will be published later this year.  The aim is to put in place a new policy that better supports sustainable mobility and a shift away from the private car to greater use of active travel and public transport.

In that regard, my priority is to restore this connectivity as soon as possible through an emergency procurement process with a view to services being operational again by mid July.</p>  <p>  This restoration of regional connectivity is of critical importance to Government. The funding which has been made available to Airports is a clear indication of this. In addition to the economy-wide measures made available to all businesses, Government is also implementing an &euro;80m funding package specifically for Irish aviation. In addition to &euro;21.3m in funding to support connectivity to the airports of Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West under the Regional Airports Programme, &euro;32.1m in funding has also been made available to Cork and Shannon airports under a Covid-19 Regional State Airports Programme 2021.   </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 24 February, the Commission approved State aid support schemes to help address liquidity issues at airports as a result of Covid-19.  The airports that will benefit from potential supports are Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Ireland West, Kerry and Donegal. Collectively, these new Covid-19 Supplementary Supports Schemes have a budget of &euro;26m.  </p>  <p>  These schemes include compensation for State airports (Dublin, Cork and Shannon) of approximately &euro;20m, in light of Covid impacts in 2020. This funding will provide State airports with flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.</p>  <p>  In addition, up to &euro;6m will also be available to regional airports that provide connectivity (Ireland West, Kerry and Donegal) under the EU Temporary Framework in recognition of the impact of COVID on their business. </p>  <p>  Applications for funding under these schemes are also currently being assessed and it is hoped that aid will be granted in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Government announcement on 26 May of a roadmap for the gradual reopening of international travel from 19 July will also help to safeguard connectivity at our regional airports.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that scheduled commercial air services are now resuming at all our regional airports with scheduled flights now operating out of Cork, Shannon and Kerry and resuming at Ireland West from Friday.  I also understand that Donegal airport expects Glasgow flights to resume next month.</p></reply>

To provide some background to this issue, you will be aware that counsel fees were reduced in both 2009 and 2010 respectively as part of a broader Government agenda to reduce escalating legal costs. A further reduction was imposed in 2011 primarily to control spending under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. These reductions were underpinned by Government decisions and formed part of a broader Government need to reduce costs across the public service.  </p>  <p>  I fully acknowledge and appreciate the very important work undertaken by barristers who prosecute criminal work on behalf of the State and my Department has engaged constructively with key stakeholders including the Bar Council of Ireland, the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Justice in relation to this matter.  In particular it has sought evidence to support any claims that the reductions imposed are linked to significant recruitment and retention issues, thereby potentially adversely impacting the administration of justice.  While my Department has not yet been provided with evidential data to support such claims., it remains available to review any further information that may be provided. </p>  <p>  My Department has also sought advice from the Attorney General's Office as to whether the State has an obligation in relation to these professional fees.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep this issue under review and engage with key stakeholders, as appropriate.</p></reply>

It represents the largest ever reform to public service pensions and remains critical to addressing the long-term sustainability of public service pensions in the face of significant demographic challenges over the coming decades.  The Single Scheme will be instrumental in stemming the future growth in expenditure on public service pensions by driving estimated savings of up to 35% over the long-term, as compared to the cost if all new entrants were granted membership of the pre-2013 public service pension schemes.  </p>  <p>  At the end of 2013, there were 12,800 active members of the Single Scheme.  By the end of 2020 there were 166,000 Single Scheme members, representing an average annual increase in membership of over 20,000 since 2013.  It is possible that Single Scheme membership could exceed 200,000 by 2025, given current levels of recruitment.  As pre-2013 public servants resign or retire, they will continue to be replaced by Single Scheme members.  Single Scheme members are likely to form the majority of public service pensioners by the second half of the century.   </p>  <p>  Given the key importance to the long-term stability and sustainability of the public finances of the Single Scheme, as provided for under the provisions of the 2012 Act, I have no plans to revisit those provisions.  The operation of the Single Scheme is, of course, subject to ongoing monitoring by my Department.</p></reply>

This is with the aim of developing a sustainable Irish agricultural sector that protects the environment and aligns with emerging consumer sentiment, while benefiting farmers and rural communities.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the allocation of &euro;1.5bn in projected carbon tax receipts over the next ten years for this purpose. This allocation to a new agri environment programme will help to encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way. The first step in meeting this commitment was in Budget 2021 through the allocation of &euro;20m in anticipated additional carbon tax receipts for the creation of pilot environmental programmes. This was supplemented with the continuation of the &euro;3m in funding that was provided for agricultural programmes from carbon tax receipts in 2020, bringing the total funding for carbon tax supported measures in the agricultural sector to &euro;23m in 2021. </p>  <p>  These funds are being used to create and operate the Results Based Environment Agri Pilot Programme or REAP scheme. Farmers in this scheme will be rewarded for their committed environmental effort and the delivery of environmental benefits including improving biodiversity, water quality, soil health, and sequestering carbon. Payments will be linked to the quality of environmental outcomes delivered.  It is expected that the REAP scheme will help to inform the development of future agri environment schemes. </p>  <p>  The use of carbon funds in 2021 was detailed in the Budget Day publication "The Use of Carbon Tax Funds 2021" which continues to be available on the budget.gov.ie website. Carbon tax funding in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine is allocated to a specific sub-head, B.13, against which progress on spending the allocated funds can be tracked.  </p>  <p>  Questions regarding the operational details of the REAP scheme should be directed to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine.</p></reply>

This sustainable level of overall expenditure growth has provided investment in our public services, particularly in the key frontline areas of Health, Education, Housing and Childcare, while at the same time bringing the General Government Balance from a deficit of 3.6% of GDP in 2014 to a surplus of 0.5% of GDP in 2019. This left the public finances in a stronger position as we faced into the crisis caused by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Over this period, this increased expenditure has allowed for increased staffing in key frontline areas, with staffing in the Health sector increasing by 18% and in the Education sector by 17% when comparing Quarter 4 2014 with Quarter 4 2019.</p>  <p>  In 2020, numbers in the Health sector increased to 124,816, a 4% increase over end-2019 and in the Education sectors, overall numbers increased by 3% to 113,336 in the same period. This demonstrates the ongoing commitment to allocate funding for recruitment of staff in order to provide vital frontline service provision to respond to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  In addition to making available &euro;12 billion in funding for Covid and Brexit related measures, Budget 2021 also provided an increase of 6.2% for core current expenditure programmes. The pandemic has demonstrated how much we rely upon our health service. In addition to providing for Covid-19 related funding, core current expenditure in the Department of Health was increased by 10.7% in Budget 2021. As outlined in Expenditure Report 2021, this Health allocation will fund an increase of approximately 16,000 posts in the health sector above the pre-Covid funded levels for 2020. </p>  <p>  The approach being adopted in relation to overall expenditure is to ensure that the growth in expenditure on public services is sustainable over the medium term. This will allow for additional staffing resources to be allocated to meet the demands for public services over the coming years.</p></reply>

Correspondence on this issue has been received in my Department and I note that the campaign has engaged with the Tan&aacute;iste on their proposals.</p>  <p>  In the context of the civil and public service, there are two main concerns in considering a move to a four day week - the cost to the taxpayer and ensuring the continuity of services to the public.</p>  <p>  On the issue of costs, there are potentially significant costs associated with a move to a four day week in the public service. Significant additional recruitment would be required in order to ensure the continued delivery of essential public services, in particular in terms of frontline and emergency public services that must be available on a seven day basis. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive analysis of the potential costs involved would involve a high degree of complexity, as it would encompass over 342,000 public servants in nearly 200 organisations. At a very high level, paying people for four days but providing services to the citizen over five and in some cases seven days would add at least a fifth to the current pay bill of approximately &euro;21bn. That equates to an extra &euro;4.2bn that would have to be found to deliver the same level of services. This is likely a conservative estimate, given the premiums associated with overtime and agency staffing, which would likely be required. </p>  <p>  In addition, maintaining the accessibility of services to citizens would be a huge challenge. For example, would there be sufficient time in four days to teach our children properly? What would happen to childcare costs if the public service moved but parts of the private sector did not? And how would the emergency services - hospitals, fire brigades, lifeguards and the Garda&iacute; - operate on a four day week?</p>  <p>  These are essential public services, the importance of which has been underlined by the Covid-19 pandemic. The wider implications of this proposal also need to be carefully considered for the entire labour force, not just the public service. Indeed any movement by the public service in isolation could have serious consequences for, in particular, small to medium businesses already struggling in the face of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I would also like to make the point that the State is already a good employer that offers considerable flexibility to staff through the availability of, amongst other things, work sharing, flexible working hours, shorter working years, career breaks and now remote working. At this time, work is underway on developing a framework for &lsquo;blended&rsquo; working, which is a priority area for my Department.</p>  <p>  In my role as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I have to ensure that quality public services are delivered to the Irish people in a manner that delivers value for money to the Irish taxpayer. </p>  <p>  With this in mind, and in light of the large potential costs and disruption to critical services I do not believe that it is the right time to consider a transition to a four day week.</p></reply>

It is in this context that we are considering how to best progress the Programme for Government commitment to &ldquo;(<i>I)ntroduce a plain language requirement on all public service communication so people can understand information the first time they read or hear it.&rdquo; </i></p><p>The next phase of public service reform will address the plain language requirement by building on the achievements of OPS2020 Action 2 &lsquo;Improve Services for our customers&rsquo; and Action 3 &lsquo;Make Services More Accessible to All&rsquo;. These include: </p><p>- Promotion of the <b><i>Customer Communications Toolkit for the Public Service</i></b>. The toolkit was prepared by the Quality Customer Service Network (QCSN), which my Department leads on under Our Public Service, in collaboration with the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design at the NDA. This toolkit received the 2019 National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA) Award for best use of plain English by an organisation. The toolkit is used extensively across the Public Service as a key reference tool. </p><p>- The Toolkit complements the <b>Plain English Style Guide for the Public Service</b>, which was developed by DPER in collaboration with NALA, which is also available on the OPS website.  </p><p>The Reform Delivery Office, in my Department, which is responsible for delivering OPS is furthermore responsible for driving the Quality Customer Service Initiative (QCSI). The QCSI sets out 12 Guiding Principles of Quality Customer Service. Principles 2: Equality/Diversity; 3: Physical Access; and, 4: Information; relate to making services more accessible to all, and have been a key part of the work programme of the Quality Customer Service Network (QCSN) since its establishment in 2000. Progressing Guiding Principle No 4, &lsquo;Information&rsquo; is of particular relevance and focuses on taking a &ldquo;proactive approach in providing information that is clear, timely and accurate, is available at all points of contact, and meets the requirements of people with specific needs&rdquo;</p><p>Promotion of the QCSI principles, the <b><i>Customer Communications Toolkit for the Public Service </i></b>and the <b>Plain English Style Guide for the Public Service</b>is undertaken through the public service-wide Quality Customer Service Network (meets quarterly, membership of over 130 Public Service Organisations) and the OPS website.</p></reply>

In 2019, the last year for which statistics are available, FOI bodies in Ireland processed 41,176 requests, once more setting a record for the greatest number of requests processed annually, and representing an increase of 8% on the previous year.  87% of the requests that were decided on in 2019 were granted in full or in part.  </p><p>In addition, it should be noted in any given year approximately 60% of requests are from the general public for personal information relating to them, such as medical or social welfare files.  No fee applies to this class of request at any stage, and in most years such requests tend to be fully granted in well over 90% of cases.  </p><p>Comprehensive review mechanisms are available under the Freedom of Information Act where a requester is dissatisfied with the decision they receive.  It is noteworthy that, in 2019, only 3% of requesters sought an internal review of an FOI decision, while just 1% of requesters went on to apply for an independent review with the Office of the Information Commissioner.</p><p>However, while objective indications are that the system as it stands is robust and functioning well, that is not to say that it could not be further improved.  Given that almost 7 years have passed since the enactment of the 2014 Act, I believe that a review of the legislation would now be timely.  </p><p>I believe there is scope for a careful and thorough appraisal of the system as it stands, as well as a wide-ranging consideration of where we might go from here.  Submissions will be sought in due course from stakeholders across the system, in particular from the general public.  I look forward to considering any observations the Deputy might wish to make as the review progresses.</p></reply>

Ireland already has comprehensive whistleblower protection legislation in place in the form of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. Transposition of the Directive will require amendments to the 2014 Act.</p>  <p>  In this regard, on 12 May 2021, following approval from Government, I published the General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Protected Disclosures Act to give effect to the Directive. My officials are now working with officials in the Office of the Attorney General on the drafting of the Bill. The General Scheme as also been referred to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach for pre-legislative scrutiny. In this regard, the Committee held a preliminary hearing with representatives from Transparency International Ireland, academia and the media on 27 May.</p>  <p>  The Protected Disclosures Act already provides protections from retaliation for workers in the public and private sectors who speak up about wrongdoing in the workplace. The proposals I have set out in the General Scheme will - in accordance with the requirements of the Directive - provide for the extension of the personal scope of the Act to volunteers and also shareholders, board members and job applicants. </p>  <p>  The question the Deputy raises as to the application of the Directive to local elected representatives is a legally complex matter and I have referred it to the Attorney General for his views.

The Circular instructs Departments to consider including green criteria in public procurement processes where: </p>  <p>  - Clearly defined, quantifiable, verifiable, and measurable criteria have been developed by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC), and are relevant to the specific procurement process, and </p>  <p>  - The cost can be met within a Department&rsquo;s existing budget, without impacting on service delivery</p>  <p>Defined, quantifiable, verifiable, and measurable criteria for a number of products and services have been developed by the Environmental Protection Agency under the auspices of DECC and are available in 'Green Procurement - Guidance for the Public Sector', which can be downloaded from gov.ie. These criteria are being updated and new criteria, for a broader range of areas, is expected to be published in 2021. Further guidance on the inclusion of both green and social criteria in public procurement can be found in the Information Note on Incorporating Social Considerations into Public Procurement published by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) in 2018.</p>  <p>  Circular 20/2019 also requires public bodies to incorporate relevant green procurement measures into their planning and reporting cycles. The Environmental Protection Agency was requested by DECC to produce a Reporting and Monitoring template for Green Public Procurement with reports for 2020 due for return in March 2021. I understand the EPA is currently assessing these reports for 2020.</p>  <p>  The OGP considers green and social criteria in the development of its solutions on a case by case basis having regard to all relevant factors including marketplace capabilities. In developing solutions, the OGP relies on the support and involvement of the users and policy departments to define their requirements. All OGP solutions meet the necessary minimum standards, legislation, codes of practice and industry standards. In addition, the OGP has included green and social considerations in a range of its solutions, for example, electric vehicles, paper, electricity, confidential shredding and catering supplies.</p>  <p>  In addition, Circular 20/2019 draws the attention of Departments to the cross-departmental Social Considerations Advisory Group, which aims to promote and facilitate the incorporation of social considerations, including environmental considerations, into public procurement projects. This group was established by the OGP, and brings together officials from policy departments with public procurement practitioners to share best practice in relevant fields. To align the objectives of the group with Programme for Government commitments, new Terms of Reference were developed in September 2020, and the group has been renamed as the Strategic Procurement Advisory Group (SPAG). This year, the OGP and DECC jointly established an environmental subgroup of the SPAG. This subgroup facilitates more detailed, technical, discussion of approaches to incorporate environmental considerations into procurement.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my officials present at a range of public sector events and seminars to promote the green and social public procurement agenda   and will continue to promote utilising the State&rsquo;s purchasing power to deliver on our commitments to sustainable development and social inclusion. Green and social procurement considerations are also discussed with the key business representative bodies at the SME Advisory Group meeting which is chaired by my colleague, Minister of State Ossian Smyth.</p></reply>

I am pleased to note the inclusion of this project within Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) 2021. </p>  <p>  The National Recovery and Resilience Plan recently published by the Government identifies advancing the green transition as a top priority and allocates significant funding towards decarbonising projects such as the retrofitting of public office accommodation. The OPW is deeply committed to helping advance sustainable solutions that mitigate against climate change, including through the new Public Sector Retrofit Pathfinder Project as well as through a Public Service Innovation Fund project, which will develop guidelines for the deep energy renovation of historic public sector properties.</p>  <p>  The Public Sector Retrofit Pathfinder Project at Tom Johnson House, located in Beggars Bush Dublin 4, will involve a significant refurbishment of this five storey over basement office building that was constructed circa 1975. This energy efficient project will be an exemplar of a &lsquo;deep retrofit&rsquo; refurbishment project and will represent the OPW as a leader in the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon, resource-efficient economy.</p>  <p>  The works will consist of a significant upgrade to the building thermal fabric and overall energy use &ndash; that will upgrade the Building Energy Rating (BER) from a C3 rating to an A2 rating, resulting in a 75% reduction of annual energy use. The project is currently out to tender and it is anticipated that the construction will start in Q4 2021 with a 21 month construction period.</p>  <p>  When the proposed works are complete, the building, which is currently occupied by the Labour Relations Commission and the Geological Survey of Ireland, will become the new headquarters of the Department of Environment, Climate &amp;amp; Communications (DECC). The overall policy for retrofitting buildings across the entire public sector rests with the DECC.</p></reply>

In particular a flow and rainfall survey and a detailed topographical survey have just been completed.  Initial environmental surveys are underway as well as an initial assessment of benefits that any future scheme may provide. It is planned to carry out an initial pubic consultation day in July to gather information about past flood events and consult the public about the types and areas where flood alleviation measures may be required. A dedicated website has been launched for the project (www.csfrs.ie).  This contains detailed information on the projects&rsquo; progress and is updated regularly.</p><p>Loughlinstown <b>(Deansgrange):</b></p><p>The Deansgrange Flood Relief Scheme is well underway.  The appointed Engineering and Environmental consultants, JBA and JB Barry, have completed the initial data collection phase of the Project (topographical surveys, environmental surveys etc.) and are currently modelling flood alleviation options that will protect the many properties at risk, particularly in the Bayview/Seafield environs.  To assist with the design of the preferred options, a detailed ground investigation has recently commenced.</p><p>An initial public engagement event took place in Q3 2020. When a cost beneficial alleviation option is identified there will be another public engagement event, this is likely to take place in Q4 2021.</p><p>As part of the project, an advance contract was awarded to construct a flood storage structure in Kilbogget Park.  This structure will restrict flow in the river and store flood waters safely in the wetland area of the park and slowly release this flood water downstream as a severe rainfall event passes.  This project is now substantially complete and will assist in providing protection to many, but not all, properties downstream.

In its recent Fiscal Assessment Report (FAR) the Council has produced a detailed analysis on the fiscal projections in the Stability Programme Update (SPU) and also on the fiscal response to the Covid crisis.</p>  <p>  In this regard, it is important to note the Council&rsquo;s assessment that the Government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic to date has been both warranted and appropriate, and in particular that the Government&rsquo;s decision to continue exceptional temporary supports in 2021 was appropriate.</p>  <p>  Looking forward, consistent with the approach set out in the SPU, the FAR outlines that Government should reduce supports in a gradual way, supporting those most affected and calibrating this based on how the recovery evolves. This approach is reflected in recent Government decisions with regard to the extension of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The FAR also outlined the Fiscal Advisory Council's views regarding the need for Government to publish a credible medium-term strategy. Given the level of uncertainty in relation to the pandemic at the time the SPU was being compiled, it was decided to prepare the SPU on a technical 'no policy change' basis. In this context, from an expenditure perspective, technical core expenditure ceilings were set out in the SPU based on an average annual growth in total voted expenditure of 3&frac12;%.  The FAR outlines that this level of annual growth in voted expenditure is insufficient to account for medium term &lsquo;stand-still costs&rdquo; associated with maintaining existing public services. However, it would have to be acknowledged that this 'stand-still' position is largely driven by certain assumptions in relation to medium term price effects rather than pre-committed levels of spending. </p>  <p>  The SPU has provided a fiscal baseline that will support Government in reaching decisions in relation to a credible medium term fiscal pathway taking account of major policy priorities. It is intended that the Summer Economic Statement will set out the Government's fiscal position in more detail, taking account inter alia of the advancements in the vaccine rollout and the position with the pandemic.</p></reply>

It is not intended to include social clauses incorporating employment activation measures in public works contracts generally since there is a substantial risk that doing so would cause considerable displacement of those already in employment.  It is a matter for individual contracting authorities to ensure that their public procurement activities are discharged in line with procurement rules and procedures.  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) supports contracting authorities in this regard by making them aware of their legal and policy obligations in respect to public procurement.</p>  <p>  The OGP has been promoting the inclusion of social considerations. To further support the incorporation of social considerations into public procurement, the OGP published Circular 20/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement.  The Circular highlights the possibilities for Departments to deliver wider social and environmental aims through public procurement including in relation to employment and training opportunities for disadvantaged groups, disability access, promoting social inclusion and social enterprises.</p>  <p>  To help policy makers and practitioners understand how procurement can be used to facilitate the advancement of existing social policy objectives as well as the wider context and implications of including them in particular procurement projects, the OGP published an Information Note on incorporating social considerations into public procurement in December 2018 which is available on ogp.gov.ie.  A cross-departmental Social Considerations Advisory Group, since re-titled the Strategic Procurement Advisory Group, was also established in March 2019.</p>  <p>  These developments promote and facilitate the inclusion of social considerations in a structured manner and are aimed at helping policy makers and procurement practitioners understand how procurement can be used to support advancement of existing social policy objectives, the wider context and the implications of including them in procurement projects.</p></reply>

This increased capacity was evident over the last year with the agility, commitment and flexibility demonstrated by the public service in meeting the challenges of the Covid 19 pandemic.</p><p>Under the new public service pay agreement 'Building Momentum, 2021 - 2022', an independent body has been established to examine the additional hours worked by public servants under the Haddington Road Agreement. </p><p>The body will consider, and fully take into account, submissions made by the parties to the Agreement and will be tasked to report by end 2021. As part of the deliberative process, the body, will consider:</p><p>- The context for the pay and productivity measures within the Haddington Road Agreement. </p><p>- The quantification and verification of the additional  worked by the Haddington Road Agreement grade, group and sector.  </p><p>- Any associated costs with reference to possible replacement  mechanisms, e.g. rostering changes, productivity measures, recruitment, overtime/premia payments, agency staffing.</p><p>- The operational, service delivery and administrative implications associated with any reduction in hourly work requirements, including the proportion of hours that support direct service delivery compared with those that provide indirect services.</p><p>-  The manner in which additional hours contributed to more  standardised public service terms and conditions. </p><p>-  the varying application of the additional hours provision of the Haddington Road Agreement. </p><p>- Relevant overtime divisors.</p><p>Roll-out of the body&rsquo;s recommendations will be initiated within the lifetime of the Agreement. In this regard, to enable commencement of the recommendations during 2022, on the publication of the Report, an envelope of &euro;150m will be made available under the Agreement across all affected grades, groups, categories and sectors. In the context of the 2023 estimates, having regard to available resources, on publication of the Report, the parties to the Agreement will engage proactively in relation to such provisions as are necessary to roll out any remaining recommendations.</p><p>It is the role of the independent body to quantify and verify the costs and replacement mechanisms for any removal of the additional hours.

This includes, where possible, the commitment to prioritise the siting of new State Agencies and Government Offices in towns and cities outside of Dublin.  While many Departments may traditionally have been headquartered in Dublin, over half of all civil servants are now located outside of Dublin.  In the case of my own Department, for example, personnel within my Department and Agencies under my Department are based in several regions throughout the country.  This includes a significant payroll operation for the National Shared Services Office that is based in Killarney that undertakes payroll transactions for the entire civil service, as well as procurement operations in Sligo, Limerick and Little Island in Cork. </p>  <p>  The vast majority of open competitions for civil service positions, which are advertised by the Public Appointments Service on www.publicjobs.ie, allow for the formation of regional panels to fill regional vacancies as the business need arises at all levels within the civil service.  Additionally, my Department operates a Mobility Programme for the civil service whereby eligible civil servants can apply for transfer to another geographic region within the country at their current grade including, for example, from Dublin to Galway or vice versa.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, Covid-19 has posed unprecedented challenges for the workforce in both the private sector and public sector in Ireland.  It has also afforded new opportunities and innovative ways of working that we are all eager to harness into the future.  The Programme for Government commits to an Enterprise Policy as part of the National Development Plan to enable increased remote, flexible and hub-working arrangements to promote better work-life balance, higher female labour market participation, less commuting, and greater regional balance.</p></reply>

The Government approved the contract in May 2019, which was subsequently signed in November 2019, and the project is now being delivered by NBI. </p><p>  Following the signing of the NBP contract, my Department no longer has any operational role in relation to the National Broadband Plan.  As the contract was signed by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, responsibility for all matters in relation to the contract, including governance and operational performance, are now a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p><p>  My position, and the position of Government, is now to seek to accelerate the roll out of the NBP, as committed to in the Programme for Government. However, it is my understanding that, among other governance arrangements, the contract signed in November 2019 contains a suite of key performance indicators to ensure the service is maintained appropriately, including significant penalties to address under-performance, and substantial provisions to reclaim the subsidy from NBI in the event of cost savings achieved or additional revenues generated. These include clawback on the deployment phase, during network operation, and at contract expiry. I understand there is also a clawback mechanism with respect to any sale of shares in NBI. </p><p>  However, as already indicated, I and my Department have no operational role in relation to the management of the NBP contract and any questions regarding the contract and/or its roll out should be directed to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></reply>

The position regarding gross general government debt against GDP also improved over this time period, from 104.4% of GDP at the end of 2014 to 57.4% of GDP at the end of 2019.  </p>  <p>  Underpinning this fiscal strategy was the policy of sustainable annual increases in public expenditure during this timeframe, with gross voted expenditure increasing by a total of &euro;13.1 billion or 24%, from &euro;54.1 billion in 2014 to &euro;67.2 billion in 2019. Over this period, to allow for the delivery of key infrastructure projects, there has been a clear focus on increasing levels of capital investment by the State. </p>  <p>  The decisions made in recent budgets have ensured that we had the financial resources to act in response to Covid-19 and to provide substantial supports to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic during 2020 and for 2021, with some &euro;28 billion allocated to date across the two years for support measures.</p>  <p>  For 2021, the Revised Estimates for Public Services (REV) outlined an overall Government Expenditure Ceiling of &euro;87.8 billion, which included almost &euro;12 billion in funding to respond to Covid-19. Within this overall expenditure ceiling, &euro;5.4 billion was set aside in reserve to be used as required during the year for temporary, targeted measures to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  This reserve was partially allocated as part of Further Revised Estimates agreed by Government in April, with almost &euro;4.3 billion in additional funding provided to the Departments of Social Protection; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Rural and Community Development for measures in response to the impact of Covid-19. In addition to this, additional Departmental Estimates will be presented to the D&aacute;il in due course reflecting the various measures set out in the National Economic Recovery Plan. </p>  <p>  It is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister to manage expenditure within their respective allocations, particularly given the exceptional level of funding being provided this year, and careful monitoring of spending against profile and of progress on programmes and projects is required. My Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices regarding this.   </p>  <p>  Based on Departmental Estimates presented to the D&aacute;il to date and as set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure to end-May 2021 amounted to nearly &euro;33 billion. While this is nearly &euro;1&frac12; billion ahead on the same period in 2020, the public health restrictions in place this year have impacted on spending plans of departments. Accordingly, gross voted expenditure is running almost &euro;1.4 billion or 4% below profile. </p>  <p>  In 2021 the main spending Departments will be reporting to Government quarterly on spending within their areas. This stands alongside a range of reforms implemented in recent years in order to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary framework and to ensure efficient and effective management of public expenditure. Looking forward, the Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the Budgetary process, building on the budgetary reforms already in place and the significant work on public service reform already completed. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, inflationary pressures continue to be dealt with on a year-by-year basis as part of the normal budgetary process. There is an expectation and a responsibility across all Departments and agencies to generate efficiency dividends and promote productivity with the resources that are provided. As the economy recovers from the impact of the pandemic, we will continue to monitor and develop our budgetary process with a view to ensuring that value for money is delivered across Government projects and programmes.</p></reply>

Correspondence on this issue has been received in my Department and I note that the campaign has engaged with the Tan&aacute;iste on their proposals.</p>  <p>  In the context of the civil and public service, there are two main concerns in considering a move to a four day week - the cost to the taxpayer and ensuring the continuity of services to the public.</p>  <p>  On the issue of costs, there are potentially significant costs associated with a move to a four day week in the public service. Significant additional recruitment would be required in order to ensure the continued delivery of essential public services, in particular in terms of frontline and emergency public services that must be available on a seven day basis. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive analysis of the potential costs involved would involve a high degree of complexity, as it would encompass over 342,000 public servants in nearly 200 organisations. At a very high level, paying people for four days but providing services to the citizen over five and in some cases seven days would add at least a fifth to the current pay bill of approximately &euro;21bn. That equates to an extra &euro;4.2bn that would have to be found to deliver the same level of services. This is likely a conservative estimate, given the premiums associated with overtime and agency staffing, which would likely be required.  </p>  <p>  In addition, maintaining the accessibility of services to citizens would be a huge challenge. For example, would there be sufficient time in four days to teach our children properly? What would happen to childcare costs if the public service moved but parts of the private sector did not? And how would the emergency services - hospitals, fire brigades, lifeguards and the Garda&iacute; - operate on a four day week?</p>  <p>  These are essential public services, the importance of which has been underlined by the Covid-19 pandemic. The wider implications of this proposal also need to be carefully considered for the entire labour force, not just the public service. Indeed any movement by the public service in isolation could have serious consequences for, in particular, small to medium businesses already struggling in the face of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  I would also like to make the point that the State is already a good employer that offers considerable flexibility to staff through the availability of, amongst other things, work sharing, flexible working hours, shorter working years, career breaks and now remote working. At this time, work is underway on developing a framework for &lsquo;blended&rsquo; working, which is a priority area for my Department.</p>  <p>  In my role as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform I have to ensure that quality public services are delivered to the Irish people in a manner that delivers value for money to the Irish taxpayer. </p>  <p>  With this in mind, and in light of the large potential costs and disruption to critical services I do not believe that it is the right time to consider a transition to a four day week.</p></reply>

The current status in relation to Crossmolina Flood Relief Scheme is as follows:</p><p>As part of the approval process under the Arterial Drainage act, the Office of Public Works (OPW) submitted the scheme documentation to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER) for Statutory Confirmation. As part of this statutory process, stakeholders were afforded a formal opportunity to provide comments on the environmental element of the proposed works. Once this step concluded, the Department of Public Expenditure (DPER) procured independent consultants to carry out an assessment of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) and Natura Impact Statement (NIS). </p><p>Following a review of the material by DPER, the OPW received comments and requests for supplementary information. The project team for the Crossmolina Flood Relief Scheme are now compiling a response to DPER and will respond with the additional requested information in July. Once DPER receive our comments, they will in turn have to review this material prior to granting Statutory Confirmation of the Scheme. I cannot provide an indicative timeline for this stage of the Confirmation process as this is outside of our control.</p><p>Subject to a satisfactory conclusion of DPER's Consultation and Independent Review, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will give statutory consent to the scheme, allowing the project team to bring Crossmolina to construction. Subject to confirmation, it is currently anticipated that the OPW construction crew will be in a position to commence advance construction works this year. These are indicative timelines and may vary depending on the confirmation process and favourable ground conditions.</p><p>Once DPER/MPER have completed their review, further information will be provided on the project website, which is available at: </p></reply>

A Steering Group, comprising representatives from the Office of Public Works and Cork County Council, is in place to progress the Bantry Flood Relief Scheme.  The Plans, with outline design of possible measures, estimated a preliminary Total Project Cost of &euro;6.7m for the scheme, which will protect some 198 properties.</p><p>On 11th March 2021 Cork County Council, in partnership with OPW, issued the tender documentation for the procurement of Engineering Consultants via www.etenders.gov.ie.  Tenders are due for return on 26th July 2021.</p><p>Once consultants are appointed to progress the Flood Relief Scheme for Bantry, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of this scheme.  In the meantime, Cork County Council has engaged a contractor to treat some of the invasive species in preparation for a flood relief scheme for the town.</p><p>The flood relief scheme will be funded from within the allocated &euro;1 billion for flood risk management over the period of the National Development Plan 2018-2027.  Provision for the cost of the Scheme is included in the Office of Public Works' multi-annual capital allocation.</p><p>Cork County Council have also commenced the preparation of the consultants brief to carry out the repair and re-construction of the Main Street Culvert, which has been identified as a significant element contributing to flooding on Main Street, New Street and north and south of Wolfe Tone Square in recent months.  The OPW is liaising with Cork County Council on the integration of these works with the flood relief scheme for the town.</p><p>In March 2021, an application under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme for interim works to mitigate flooding in Bantry, which includes installation of non-return valves and provision of mobile pumps, was submitted to the OPW by Cork County Council.  This application is currently under consideration.</p><p>In addition to the above proposals, prior to forecasted extreme weather events, local area staff from CCC are implementing interim measures to assist mitigate flooding, such as deployment of sandbags at Sands Quay and mobile pumping.</p><p><b><i>Skibbereen Flood Relief Scheme</i></b></p><p>Construction of the Skibbereen Flood Relief Scheme commenced in July 2016 and was substantially completed on 6th June 2019.  The Scheme was constructed under the Arterial Drainage Acts, with Cork City Council acting as Contracting Authority and agent for the OPW.  All identified defects arising from the construction have now been remedied, with some delays as a result of Covid-19.</p><p>Planning for the Operation and Maintenance of the scheme is ongoing in conjunction with Cork County Council, who will act as agents of the OPW in carrying out the statutory operation and maintenance of the scheme.  A small number of works to address elements identified during construction, which were outside the main construction contract, remain to be completed and are being progressed in separate works packages.</p></reply>

In this context I have taken the opportunity to meet with the relevant parties involved in these schemes to hear at first hand their issues of concern.</p>  <p>  The particular matter raised is a complex one that raises significant policy, legal and exchequer cost issues. As it relates to the Community Employment scheme, a resolution must be progressed via the Department of Social Protection. The Deputy will appreciate that the State is not the employer of the workers concerned. This is a factor which must be borne in mind in the terms of the approach to this.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also appreciate, we are now facing major challenges in managing the public finances. However, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Protection, I have given fresh consideration to all the issues involved and have recently written to Minister Humphries in relation to a proposed way forward in relation to this complex issue. I understand that Minister Humphries and her officials are now in the process of engaging with the relevant stakeholders to make progress.</p></reply>

This substantial additional funding has been critical in supporting our citizens and businesses devastated by the impact of the pandemic and providing the necessary funding to our key public services to allow them to respond effectively to the crisis.</p>  <p>  Following the onset of the pandemic in 2020, additional funding of over &euro;16 billion was allocated to Departments during the year to provide supports in response to Covid-19.  Key areas where this additional funding was allocated include: over &euro;10 billion provided to the Department of Social Protection to fund measures including direct income supports for businesses and workers; &euro;2.5 billion for the Health service; almost &euro;1 billion for business supports through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in addition to &euro;0.9 billion to meet the costs of the commercial rates waiver; along with substantial additional funding for the transport and education sectors.  At the end of 2020, gross voted expenditure as per the outturn in the December 2020 Fiscal Monitor was &euro;85.3 billion, almost &euro;15 billion higher than the original pre-Covid allocation of &euro;70.4 billion reflecting the impact of the additional funding allocated to respond to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided for an overall expenditure ceiling of &euro;87.8 billion, with almost &euro;12 billion of this available to fund measures to continue the response to the challenges of Covid-19.  &euro;6&frac12; billion of this was allocated at Departmental level for measures related to Covid-19 while &euro;5.4 billion was set aside in reserve.</p>  <p>  Among the main measures provided for by the additional allocations to Departments: were the continuation of employment and income supports, with &euro;3.2 billion for Social Protection; &euro;1.9 billion to support the health service; just over &euro;0.45 billion to the Education sector (including Further and Higher Education); roughly &euro;0.45 billion for transport measures; &euro;0.1 billion for on-going Covid-19 supports to businesses; and over &euro;0.2 billion for measures to address the significant impacts on sectors including tourism, culture, and sport. </p>  <p>  The allocation of almost &euro;4.3 billion of contingency funding to Departments was agreed by Government in April. This provided for &euro;4 billion of additional funding to the Department of Social Protection, primarily to fund the extension of the PUP and EWSS to the end of June, an additional &euro;250m for a range of business supports and &euro;10m additional funding to the Covid-19 Stability Fund.</p>  <p>The Economic Recovery Plan published by Government on June 1st announced continued support for people and businesses. Where costs for these measures exceed the provision already made available, additional estimates for Departments will be necessary, with an increase to the Government Expenditure Ceiling as required.</p></reply>

This comes not long after the announcement by Viatris that it is to close one of its Baldoyle operations. Our primary concern is for the workers and families affected by this news. While I understand that both plants will remain operational until the end of 2022, it is nonetheless a devastating blow for those affected.</p><p>My Department has agreed a Job Loss Response Protocol with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. The protocol puts in place actions to assist the workers, including welfare entitlements, job-search assistance and upskilling needs/opportunities. Every State support will be made available, when the time comes, to help workers transition and find new employment opportunities. I understand that members of the Dublin Mid-Leinster Employer Relations team have already engaged directly with Viatris to offer supports to staff being made redundant and are available to engage with Teva once a formal notification of redundancy is received.</p><p>  IDA Ireland is working with both companies at local and corporate level. The Agency will continue to provide support over coming months, including reviewing opportunities in terms of skills and retraining, as well as possibilities for the future use of the sites.

The new employer must also continue to observe the terms and conditions of any collective agreements until they expire or are replaced. </p>  <p>  Both the outgoing and incoming employers are obliged to inform their respective employees&rsquo; representatives of, inter alia, the reasons for the transfer and the legal, social and economic implications of the transfer. </p>  <p>  The Redundancy Payments Act 1967 provides where there is a change in the ownership of a business and an employee continues, by arrangement, to work for the new owner with no break in employment, the employee is not entitled to any redundancy payment at the time of the change of ownership. However, continuity of employment is preserved for the purpose of the redundancy payments in the event of a dismissal or redundancy by the new employer at any future date. </p>  <p>  The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is the organisation mandated to secure compliance with employment rights legislation.  Employees can refer complaints to and seek adjudications from the WRC, including in situations where an employee considers that a breach of the The European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 has occurred or there is a dispute between an employer and employee in relation to redundancy entitlements. </p>  <p>  The WRC&rsquo;s Customer Service and Information Unit provides information on employment, equality and industrial relations rights and obligations.

Details of activity during 2020 can be found in my Department&rsquo;s Annual Report 2020, published at www.enterprise.gov.ie.</p><p>Key policy achievements since 27 June 2020 include the following:</p><p>We published a &euro;7 billion Jobs Stimulus in July 2020. A range of financial and regulatory measures were developed and expanded to assist businesses during the pandemic. These include ensuring that companies had access to finance through the Future Growth Loan Scheme, the SBCI-COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme and Microfinance Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Loan and Brexit Business Loan schemes. Further initiatives included the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, the Restart Grant and the Restart Grant Plus, the Online Retail Scheme and the Trading Online Voucher Scheme. </p><p>On legislation, my Department moved to implement temporary emergency measures to enable companies to meet their statutory obligations under company law and to proactively respond to the pressures businesses were facing in relation to solvency in the context of the lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 crisis.  I have brought several Bills to Government for approval to draft, including the General Scheme of the Sale of Tickets (Cultural, Entertainment, Recreational and Sporting Events) Bill 2021, the General Scheme of the Consumer Rights Bill, the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2021, the Investment Screening Bill and the Control of Exports Bill. I have prioritised and accelerated the development of a new rescue process for small and micro companies with a view to ensuring that viable companies have the best possible chance of survival after COVID-19. My Department is also working on legislation to establish the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to be a stand-alone statutory body.  </p><p>The EU Platforms to Business Regulation, the first ever set of rules for creating a fair, transparent and predictable business environment for smaller businesses and traders on online platforms, was transposed into national law. A Sub-Group on Insurance Reform was established within the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery, which I chair. The Action Plan is well advanced, with important actions such as the Personal Injuries Guidelines commenced in April 2020.</p><p>Improving terms and conditions for all workers is a priority for me. We are proceeding with plans for statutory sick pay and the living wage. A Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect was launched as part of the National Remote Working Strategy published in January 2021. We published extensive guidance, including our Guide to Supports for Businesses, the National Work Safely Protocol and guidance on safe shopping.  A COVID-19 contingency plan ensured that the employment permit regime could continue to operate throughout the crisis though the introduction, on a temporary basis, of a type of &lsquo;e-employment permit&rsquo;. </p><p>Other key achievements include working across Government to develop Ireland&rsquo;s position in response to the EU Commission proposals for the revision of the state aid framework. We published a Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents. We provided targeted support for companies in the area of research, development and the production of COVID-19 related products, and launched a third call under the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund.</p><p>We worked closely with the Department of An Taoiseach on Ireland&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan, which aims to achieve rapid job creation and economic growth after the pandemic, and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to include enterprise programmes for digitalisation and decarbonisation in Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan. We contributed to the Climate Action Plan showing my Department&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to climate action. We also continued extensive work to ensure a coordinated and coherent approach to Brexit in preparation for all Brexit outcomes. </p><p>Following the formation of the Government in 2020, my Department took on responsibilities for trade promotion, employment rights and redundancy and insolvency policy, the Low Pay Commission, Balance for Better Business and Trading Online Vouchers.</p></reply>

The Communications and Media Relations Division of my Department is responsible for managing my Department&rsquo;s social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.

Furthermore, as part of commitments set out under the Programme for Government, my Department is working with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to carry out a national land use review. The review will include consideration of emissions to air and water, carbon sequestration, and climate adaptation challenges. Policy co-benefits, such as rewetting or forest regrowth to mitigate flooding risks in river catchments, will be considered. </p>  <p>  The EU Emissions Trading System is a cornerstone of EU policy on climate change mitigation promoting cost-effective emissions reduction and is the first and largest carbon market and works on the &lsquo;cap and trade&rsquo; principle. No such trading system exists for carbon on a private landowner scale. However, I would underline that while there is much to do in terms of policy development, as I have highlighted above, with the correct policy choices in the agriculture and land use sector, there is potential to reward farmers and land owners for sequestering carbon, restoring biodiversity, improving water and air quality, producing clean energy, and developing schemes that support results-based outcomes.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that a response to the query has been prepared and will issue this week.</p></reply>

The focus of the strategy was on high impact actions which aimed to make a real difference to the lives of those in energy poverty.</p>  <p>  Good progress has been made under the strategy including:</p>  <p>   - Free upgrades were carried out in over 23,000 lower income homes under the main Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) energy poverty retrofit schemes;</p>  <p>   - A consultation on energy efficiency in the rented sector has also been completed which has informed changes to energy efficiency grant schemes with further recommendations to follow later this year;</p>  <p>   - Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically over the period from &euro;15 million in 2015 to over &euro;109 million for 2021.</p>  <p>   - The allocations for retrofit of social housing have also increased significantly with an allocation of &euro;65 million for 2021.</p>  <p>  Income supports from the Department of Social Protection  to help households with the costs of heating their homes have also increased. The Minister for Social Protection provides an estimated &euro;300 million in 2021 for a Fuel Allowance payment, of &euro;28.00 per week for 28 weeks, which is a total of &euro;784 each year, from October to April, to an average of 372,000 low income households. In addition, the Minister for Social Protection also provides an electricity or gas allowance under the Household Benefits scheme at an estimated cost of &euro;265 million in 2021. This is paid at a rate of &euro;35 per month, 12 months of the year. The Department of Social Protection also funds an exceptional needs payment, which can include support with fuel bills in some cases.</p>  <p>  Research undertaken by the Economic and Social research Institute shows that the proportion of households in or at risk of energy poverty has reduced from 28% in 2015 to 17.5% in 2020.  The Survey on Income and Living Conditions also shows that the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, has fallen from 9% in 2015 to 4.9% in 2019.</p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed this year and this will inform the next steps.  Alleviating energy poverty will also be a key consideration for the National Retrofit Framework which will be published this year. Retrofitting of homes supports good physical and mental health by creating healthy indoor living environments with healthy air temperatures, humidity levels, noise levels, and improved air quality.</p></reply>

It also commits to balanced regional development underpinned by a digitally connected society and transitioning to a circular economy.  My Department published its Statement of Strategy for the period 2021-2023 in March of this year which sets out our strategic goals in line with the Programme for Government and our long-term vision of a climate neutral, sustainable and digitally connected Ireland. Since the second half of 2020, my Department has continued to progress the development and implementation of a wide range of policies and programmes across the breadth of its remit. Some of the main deliverables achieved in that timeframe include:</p><p>- The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas as priority legislation. This landmark bill will set Ireland on the path to net-zero emissions no later than 2050, and to a 51% reduction in emissions by the end of this decade.</p><p>- Progressing the Climate Action Plan to reflect the much higher PfG emissions reduction ambition. The updated Climate Action Plan will be published shortly.</p><p>- The establishment of the Climate Action Fund on a statutory basis, through the early enactment of the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill.</p><p>- The publication of the second progress report of the Just Transition Commissioner and the approval of the first tranches of funding from the Just Transition Fund.</p><p>- Regulations were finalised to extend the Smoky Coal ban to an additional 13 towns ban. In addition, a public consultation sought views on the further regulation of solid fuel use for domestic home heating earlier this year.</p><p>- The designation of SEAI as the National Retrofitting Delivery Body.</p><p>- &euro;221.5m secured for residential and community retrofit programmes in Budget 2021, the highest allocation ever to these programmes.</p><p>- 82 new renewable energy projects received funding under the first Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) auction. The RESS scheme will support an investment in Ireland of over &euro;1.4 billion and support the recovery by creating roughly 1,000 jobs.</p><p>- Published the framework for Ireland&rsquo;s Offshore Electricity Transmission System which will facilitate the expansion of offshore wind energy to help the country meet its greenhouse gas emissions targets.</p><p>- The Government approved the Policy Statement on the Importation of Fracked Gas including a moratorium on the development of LNG import terminals pending the completion of review of security of supply.</p><p>- Public consultations on the Community Benefit Fund for the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, the Microgeneration Support Scheme and the Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme have recently closed and the responses will inform the design of these initiatives.</p><p>- Government approval was received to introduce legislation to ban licences for new oil and natural gas exploration. The legislation will be included in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021.</p><p>- The establishment of a Circular Economy Unit within my Department.</p><p>- The publication of a Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy.</p><p>- Two public consultations were held on the introduction of a Deposit and Return Scheme, the most recent on the preferred model and legislative framework for the delivery of the scheme.</p><p>- Continuing the rollout the National Broadband Plan Ireland to deliver NBP - design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across every county with nearly 223,000 premises surveyed and 322 Broadband Connection Point sites have been installed as of start June this year.</p><p>My Department will continue to progress our priorities and Programme for Government commitments in 2021.  The Department's Annual Report for 2021 will be published shortly.</p></reply>

This study was undertaken in the context of the national climate and energy policies that were in place in 2018. In the period since, there has been significant development of national policy including the 2020 Programme for Government commitments to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade) and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. In this context, I consider the 2018 report to be of limited, if any, relevance to current policy development. Furthermore, I can confirm that extending the natural gas network will not be included in the upcoming Climate Action Plan as a means of decarbonisation.</p></reply>

There are 42,335 premises in County Cavan of which 26,061 are in the commercial area and 16,274 premises are within the NBP Intervention Area. There are 33,465 premises in County Monaghan of which 18,133 are in the commercial area and 15,332 premises are within the NBP Intervention Area. I am advised by National Broadband Ireland that, as of 10 June 2021, over 225,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. In County Cavan, premises have been surveyed or surveys are ongoing in the areas of Ballinagh, Corlurgan, Araghan, Poles, Caughoo, Belturbet, Killashandra, Butler&rsquo;s Bridge, Ballylennon, Redhills, Gannons Cross, Derryheelan, Castlesaunderson, Townparks, Foalies Bridge, Riverrun and Erne Hill.  Main works are ongoing outside Cavan town including Ballinagh, Corlurgan, Araghan, Poles, and Caughoo. In County Monaghan almost 70% of premises in the Intervention Area have been surveyed to date. Premises have been surveyed or surveys are ongoing in the areas of Cornacassa, Cortolvin, Ballybay, Stranooden, Mullinahinch, Bellanode, Drumhilock, Tydavnet, Cloughnart, Scotstown, Killymarley, Drumcru, Stonebridge, Tiernahinch, Clones, Annalore, Kileevan, Drumullan, Newbliss, Cumber, Scotshouse, Clonowla, Clonagore and Clonooney.</p><p>Main works have commenced in the Monaghan Deployment Area which covers approximately 4,355 premises. This includes the areas of Ballagh, Stranodden, Drumloo, Aghaboy, Kilcorran, Annagola, Brookvale, Cloghernagh, Feebane, Gortakeeghan, Mullandavagh and Selloo.​ NBI anticipates that these premises will be passed and available for connection later this year. I am advised by NBI that, as of 10 June, nearly 4,400 homes are passed and available for connection to the NBI high speed broadband in Counties Cork and Cavan. Some 3,580 premises are passed and are available for connection in County Cavan.  A further 15,000 premises can also pre-order via Retail Service Providers (RSPs) in Counties Cork, Cavan, Galway and Limerick and get a connection in the coming months.</p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays on delivery of aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally), as well as the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale, up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project. </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Cavan and Monaghan through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 10 June, 325 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible locations and the Department of Education for schools. BCPs installed with high speed publicly accessible broadband in County Cavan include Templeport Community Centre, Kildallan Parish Hall, Mullahoran Community Centre, Drumavaddy Community Centre, Glengevlin Community Hall, Gallonray House, Castlerahan Community Centre, Cornafean Community Centre, Bunnoe Community Centre, Castle Saunderson Scout Centre, Killenkere Leisure Centre. BCPs installed in County Monaghan include Tullycorbet Parish Hall, Corcaghan Community Centre, Monaghan GAA Centre Of Excellence, Mullyash Community Centre, Tannagh Outdoor Education Centre, Ballybay Wetlands, Carn Resource Centre, Latton Resource Centre, Saint Alphonsus Community Hall, Corduff Community Centre and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Accommodation Centre.</p><p>Corlea National School, Laragh National School, Kildallan National School, Saint Patrick's School and Greaghrahan National School are installed in County Cavan as part of this initiative. Annalitten National School, Connons National School, Drumcorrin National School, Drumgossatt National School, Saint Mary's School and Saint Brigid&rsquo;s National School are installed in County Monaghan as part of this initiative.  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at .</p></reply>

Pending a satisfactory evaluation, I hope to be in a position to formally approve funding, in the region of &euro;10 million, for this project in the coming weeks.</p><p>In addition to the above capital funding, airports will also be invited to apply for operational supports, under these Programmes, later in the year.  </p><p>In relation to funding under the Covid-19 Supplementary Support Scheme, applications are currently being assessed by my Department and it is anticipated that funding will be dispersed in the coming weeks.  </p><p>Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, the Government has made significant funding available to the Irish aviation industry through a range of business supports. The bulk of the support to airlines is through the TWSS/EWSS wage subsidy schemes which were specifically designed to maintain the link between employers and employees. It is estimated that by end-June 2021, the sector will have received approximately &euro;300 million in such supports.  In addition, liquidity support has also been made available to the aviation industry through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation Fund. Aer Lingus has already secured a &euro;150m loan under this fund.</p></reply>

This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>The project is due to be completed in 2022.</p><p>Further details on ESB charge points nationwide can be found at </p><p>While several private operators such as Tesla, Ionity &amp;amp; EasyGO are involved in providing charging infrastructure, my Department does not hold information on the location of charging infrastructure which has been installed without government support.  I am aware, however, that ESB has partnered with Tesco Ireland to install 22kW Standard AC Chargers at a number of Tesco locations around the country. More than 50 of these are planned in total. </p><p>My Department is also making &euro;2 million available this year through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p><p>In addition to the ESB project, the Public Charge Point Scheme has been in place since September 2019 and will continue to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles (EVs), who donot have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs.</p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. To support home charging, the SEAI, on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit. </p><p>Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. However, there are a number of complex planning issues to address before we can expand the grant in an appropriate manner so as to include the required categories of shared parking. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address the issues.</p><p>The Programme for Government published in June last year, commits to publishing an electric vehicles infrastructure strategy to facilitate the uptake of these EVs. Once completed, the strategy will provide a key framework for ensuring we continue to have sufficient infrastructure in place to keep ahead of demand, while also ensuring that appropriate planning and development guidelines are followed in providing the necessary capacity. It is envisaged that the strategy will be published later this year.</p></reply>

The current status of the process can be referenced in the Published eTenders update on eTenders and a dedicated page on Gov.ie (SAR Webpage). This is an on-going deliberative process which will ultimately lead to a Government decision so I am limited in what I can say in relation to this at the moment. </p>  <p>  The process itself commenced in November 2019 with the establishment of a Steering Group in my Department under the Chair of the Director of the Irish Coast Guard and a variety of state stakeholders including other Government Departments and agencies with an interest in the SAR aviation service. This was with a view to ensuring a whole of Government approach to the management of this process.   </p>  <p>  A first key step was to prepare a Strategic Assessment and Preliminary Appraisal. This went to Government in July 2020. This document included a strategic assessment setting out the context for SAR aviation programme, an organisational overview, and a survey of existing policies and strategies relevant to the programme. It identified the spending objectives of the programme including existing arrangements and relevant business needs. It also included an appraisal of various service delivery options, including where the state assumed full responsibility for the service, either through the Air Corps or a dedicated IRCG Aviation Branch. </p>  <p>  While it was accepted that the Air Corps could not assume responsibility for this service on the basis of that initial assessment, my Department was requested in November of 2020 by the Department of Defence to consider the viability of the Air Corps providing some element of the IRCG&rsquo;s aviation service. This consideration is being done as part of the detailed business case currently being prepared by KPMG along with all other viable options for the delivery of this vital service. </p>  <p>  The outcome of the business case will go to Government over the Summer and it is expected that a tender will issue shortly thereafter. Regardless of the outcome of this process, the Defence Forces will continue to play a vital partnership role in the delivery of Search and Rescue services for the State working closely with the Irish Coast Guard.</p></reply>

This project has now reached an important milestone as its Preliminary Business Case has been submitted to my Department for review as is required under the <i>Public Spending Code</i>. For projects of this scale, the <i>Public Spending Code </i>stipulates that Government approval is required to allow the project submit its Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The Preliminary Business Case has been developed on the basis of the existing project as has been subject to public consultation in recent years. The Preferred Route for MetroLink is available to view on the dedicated project website, www.metrolink.ie.</p><p>Secondly, we have the statutory review of the <i>Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area</i>. The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 stipulates that the <i>Strategy</i>must be reviewed every six years and this review provides an opportunity to re-examine and re-consider proposals for inclusion in the revised Strategy.

I understand this public consultation phase will commence in the coming months.</p><p>Inclusion in any revised <i>Strategy</i>is the first step in what is a very detailed and often lengthy process to enable projects move from the strategic support, enabled by inclusion in a <i>Transport Strategy</i>, to being a project with a Preliminary Business Case seeking approval to enter the statutory planning process.</p></reply>

The high-level strategic context, including passenger demand and forecasted modal share, for all of our commuter rail networks is set out in their relevant metropolitan area transport strategies which are all available online. At a project-level forecasted passenger demand is obviously a key component of the development of the business cases. </p>  <p>  As an example, the Preliminary Business Case for DART+ has recently been received by my Department and is under review as required under the Public Spending Code. As the Deputy is aware DART+ proposes DART level all-day services across the network from Drogheda on the Northern Line, Maynooth on Western Line, Hazelhatch on the South Western Line and Greystones on the South Eastern Line and will result in a doubling of capacity as a result. </p>  <p>  Another project underway at the moment is the addition of 41 rail carriages to the Greater Dublin Area rail fleet. These carriages are under construction at the moment and will start to arrive next year and will add around 34% capacity to the system as compared to before. </p>  <p>  I have no doubt that the passenger response to this additional capacity will be as strong as it has been in the past where we have invested in our public transport network.</p></reply>

For this reason, our aviation policy places a priority on international connectivity. The sector is experiencing the most challenging crisis in its history, with many analysts predicting that it will take several years for it to return to 2019 levels of activity. </p>  <p>  My officials and I have maintained regular contact with key stakeholders throughout this crisis, and Government has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including the aviation sector. These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, and the SBCI Working Capital Scheme. Liquidity funding is also available through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund for medium and large enterprises. It is estimated that, by the end of June this year, our airlines and airports will have received at least &euro;300 million from several available supports. </p>  <p>  In November 2020 the Government agreed a revised funding package of &euro;80 million specifically for Irish aviation for 2021. &euro;21 million is being provided under the Regional Airports Programme (2021-2025). This gives funding certainty to Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airport Knock and supports domestic PSO routes from Dublin Airport to Donegal and Kerry. &euro;32 million is being provided to Cork and Shannon Airports through a new one-year COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme. A &euro;26 million, European Commission approved, Irish State Aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by COVID-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread. The scheme will augment the supports already in place and help the industry to maintain connectivity and recover from the impact of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Such supports and schemes notwithstanding, all service providers in the sector, apart from those substantially or exclusively dedicated to air cargo, have had no option but to radically address their cost base and seek to safeguard liquidity. Alongside rationalisation measures, the major service providers are shoring up their finances through increased borrowings or raising new capital. </p>  <p>  Several public health measures have been introduced in relation to international travel, which have developed and evolved as the pandemic has progressed, with the objective of both limiting the spread of COVID-19 and limiting the presence of its variants of concern in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The main requirement of all aviation stakeholders has been clarity from Government on a plan to permit the resumption of non-essential international air travel, and the Government outlined such a plan on 28 May, which is scheduled to begin on 19 July. This plan brings together the EU Digital COVID Certificates, pre-departure PCR testing, mandatory quarantine, and our public health measures so that international travel can operate safely. An &ldquo;emergency brake&rdquo; mechanism will also allow us to respond to the potential emergence of variants of concern. </p>  <p>  While it may take some time for our aviation sector to regain the strong economic position it had at the start of the pandemic, Government has committed to ensuring that there will be no &ldquo;cliff-edge&rdquo; to the COVID-19 related business supports that are currently available. On 1 June, Government launched its Economic Recovery Plan 2021 with the goal of achieving rapid job creation and economic growth after the pandemic. This plan sets out new measures for businesses and affected sectors as the economy reopens, and details for existing emergency pandemic financial supports including the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), giving certainty to employers, workers, and for those who need it most.  </p>  <p>  With our vaccination programme progressing, a plan for the resumption of non-essential international travel ready and significant levels of business supports available, aviation is now positioned to begin to recover.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is working closely with all transport operators to ensure that public transport services continue to operate in a safe manner during the crisis.  </p>  <p>  Public transport services have continued to operate safely over the course of this pandemic and operators have taken heed of all public health requirements.  This has included the mandatory wearing of face coverings, social distancing measures onboard services, as well as an enhanced daily cleaning regime across the transport fleet.  In addition, transport operators have added signage on the windows of vehicles where windows can be opened asking customers to leave them open.  Operators are continuing to research ways in which public transport can provide as safe and reliable an environment as possible.  Additional cleaning techniques are being researched and air conditioning systems, where installed, are being checked regularly to ensure they are operating as intended.  The NTA and transport operators will continue to observe all public health advice relating to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  In relation to air travel, the quality of air provided during a flight is very high.  This is due to frequent exchange of air (the entire air supply is typically exchanged every 3-5 minutes) and High-Efficiency Particulate Arrestor (HEPA) filters which are used on board most modern aircraft.  It is my understanding that HEPA filters have been installed in all modern commercial jet aircraft for many years. For example, Airbus indicate they have been installed on new Airbus aircraft since 1994.  Through communication at the National Air Transport Facilitation Committee, I understand that both the Ryanair and Aer Lingus fleets are all fitted with HEPA filters. </p>  <p>  The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and European Centre for Disease Prevention &amp;amp; Control (ECDC) guidelines address the scenario where aircraft do not have HEPA filters.  It states that aeroplane operators using aircraft without HEPA filters avoid the use of cabin air recirculation entirely, provided it is confirmed that this will not compromise any safety critical functions (e.g. avionics cooling, cabin pressurisation etc.). </p>  <p>  I wish to highlight that the air quality on aircraft is just one of a suite of measures that can ensure passengers are safe, and not exposed to the COVID-19 virus while flying, as set out in the ECDC and EASA guidance.</p></reply>

The Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) set the price cap at &euro;9.30 for 2019. </p>  <p>  For 2020 and 2021 the CAR set the price cap per passenger at &euro;7.50.  If passenger numbers this year are in line with those in 2020 (7.4m passengers) - the costs could be in the region of &euro;55m for 2021 if a full rebate was applied for this year.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I can advise the Deputy that from June 2020 to June 2021, the IAA invoiced airlines terminal charges of &euro;6.2 million. These air navigation charges are attributable to aircraft landing/taking off at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports (Terminal charges only).</p>  <p>  In response to the recommendations of the Taskforce, Government put in place an &euro;80m aviation support package which was announced on 10 November.  This package includes &euro;21.3 million for the Regional Airports Programme and &euro;32.1 million for a new COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme.  Under these Programmes, the airports of Donegal, Kerry, Knock, Cork and Shannon will have access to capital and operational supports in 2021. </p>  <p>  Following consultation with the European Commission, State aid Schemes to the value of &euro;26 million to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were established. These schemes include compensation for State airports (Dublin, Cork and Shannon) of approximately &euro;20 million, in light of Covid impacts in 2020. This funding Scheme was considered the most appropriate and State aid compliant way to provide State airports with flexibility to roll out route incentives/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.</p>  <p>  The Department is currently assessing applications for this funding and would hope to be in a position to disburse this compensation in the coming weeks.  In order to ensure parity of treatment, funding will be allocated proportionately in line with 2019 passenger numbers at the airports.  </p>  <p>  In addition, up to &euro;6 million is also available to regional airports that provide connectivity (Knock, Kerry and Donegal) under the EU Temporary Framework in recognition of the impact of COVID on their business. Applications for funding under this measure are also currently being assessed and it is hoped that aid will be granted in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Throughout the COVID-19, the Government has made significant funding available to the Irish aviation industry through a range of business supports.  The bulk of the support to airlines is through the TWSS/EWSS wage subsidy schemes which were specifically designed to maintain the link between employers and employees. It is estimated that by end-June 2021, the sector will have received approximately &euro;300 million in such supports.  In addition, liquidity support has also been made available to the aviation industry through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation Fund. Aer Lingus has secured a &euro;150m loan under this fund.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants, where applicable.</p>  <p>  I announced the 2021 regional and local road allocations earlier this year and all grant funding available to my Department has now been allocated.</p>  <p>  There were major cutbacks in funding for the road network in general during the post 2008 recession. The National Development Plan (NDP), as it stands, provides for a gradual increase in funding for regional and local roads and there has been a significant increase in Exchequer funding particularly in the last four years.  In this context, Tipperary County Council received a total allocation of &euro;29,526,858 for 2021 which is an increase of approximately 60% when compared to 2017.</p>  <p>  Funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads and so for this reason, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects.</p>  <p>  As regards the basis for allocating grants, within the budget available to the Department, funding is allocated on as fair and equitable a basis as possible to eligible local authorities. In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of the road network within a local authority's area of responsibility with some account taken of traffic. It is envisaged that grants will continue to be made available on that basis.</p>  <p>  Basing regional and local roads grant allocations on road conditions could result in an uneven distribution of State funding. For example, local authorities that allocate higher levels of own resources funding to regional and local roads will have a larger proportion of roads with a higher condition rating than those with lower levels of own resources funding. Basing allocations on road condition could therefore disincentivise local authorities from allocating own resources funding to roads maintenance.</p>  <p>  The Department appreciates that, within the overall parameters set for the grant programme, local authorities might need to target funding at particular problem areas and there is sufficient flexibility in the structure of the grant programme to allow for this. It is also open to each local authority to allocate its own resources to priority areas. In this context the Department has supported the development of a road asset management system for regional and local roads &ndash; MapRoad - to provide the data needed for each local authority to manage its network as effectively as possible, including the prioritisation of works for inclusion in its maintenance and renewal works programme.  The road pavement condition information generated by the MapRoad system forms the basis for the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) performance reports each year. </p>  <p>  My Department will be issuing a Circular shortly to local authorities regarding the preparation and submission of the next 3 year 2022 -2024 Restoration Improvement Programme.</p></reply>

The previous Commission on Taxation in their 2009 report observed the following:</p><p><i>&quot;However, in relation to income tax, a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; arrangement has been in place since 2000, with regard to the tax band structure and credits that apply to married couples. We consider that this arrangement should remain in place as it represents a balance between, on the one hand, acknowledging the choices families make in caring for children and, on the other, taking account of the need to encourage labour force participation.&quot;</i></p><p>This is an area that is kept under review. </p><p>On the specific arrangements in place, I am advised by Revenue that the home carer tax credit may be claimed by a married couple or civil partners where one spouse or civil partner (the &lsquo;home carer&rsquo;) cares for one or more dependent persons. </p><p>Eligibility for the home carer tax credit is subject to a number of conditions, as follows:</p><p>- The married couple or civil partners must be jointly assessed to tax;</p><p>- The home carer must care for one or more dependent persons; and</p><p>- The dependent person(s) must normally reside with the married couple or civil partners for the tax year, however certain exceptions apply where the dependent person is a relative.</p><p>To obtain the full tax credit (&euro;1,600 for 2021), the home carer&rsquo;s income must not exceed &euro;7,200 in the tax year. Where the home carer&rsquo;s income is over &euro;7,200, the tax credit available is reduced by one half of the excess amount earned over this limit. The home carer tax credit will therefore not be available for 2021 where the home carer&rsquo;s income exceeds &euro;10,400.  Both carer&rsquo;s benefit and carer&rsquo;s allowance payments from the Department of Social Protection are disregarded for the purposes of determining the annual income threshold of &euro;7,200.</p><p>The standard rate band, where one spouse or civil partner is in receipt of income, is currently &euro;44,300. For dual income couples, this amount can be increased by the lesser of &euro;26,300 or the income of the lower earner. The maximum standard rate band for a dual income couple in 2021 is therefore &euro;70,600. </p><p>By virtue of the legislation contained in section 466A Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, a couple or civil partners cannot claim both the increased standard rate band for dual income couples and the home carer tax credit in the same year.  They may however claim whichever of the two is more beneficial to them. </p><p>Revenue will grant whichever relief &ndash; the home carer tax credit or the increased standard rate band - will provide the most beneficial treatment for the taxpayer.  Further details on determining whether the home carer tax credit or the increased standard rate band may be more advantageous can be found in section 6 of Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-29 published on Revenue's website ().  </p><p>Alternatively, taxpayers may contact the National PAYE helpline at 01-7383636 where they will receive any assistance required to establish the more advantageous option, based on their individual circumstances.</p></reply>

My Department also continues to provide technical input around the economic impact of COVID-19 and the related policy response. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan was submitted to the European Commission on 28 May 2021. The draft Plan, worth almost &euro;1bn, will enable Ireland to access funding under the Recovery and Resilience Facility. This Facility is the centrepiece of the Next Generation EU (NGEU), the EU&rsquo;s &euro;750bn pandemic recovery package. Ireland is expected to receive approximately &euro;915m in grants under the Facility for the period 2021-2022, with further grants in 2023.</p>  <p>  On 30 March 2021, Ireland received &euro;2.492bn under the EU&rsquo;s SURE scheme (Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency). SURE is a temporary instrument, providing up to &euro;100bn in loans from the EU to Member States affected by increases in public expenditure aimed at preserving employment during the pandemic. The amount of the Irish application was based on costs already expended under the COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). </p>  <p>  In July 2020, I brought forward the Financial Provisions (COVID-19) Bill to enable the State to participate in the EU crisis recovery instruments, the SURE scheme and the &euro;25bn Pan-European Guarantee Fund. My Department has undertaken significant work on the EU regulatory package which forms part of the EU Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth. Sustainable finance is a priority, accounting for 10 of the 46 action measures under the Ireland for Finance 2021 Action Plan. Ireland for Finance is the strategy for the development of the IFS sector in Ireland to 2025. </p>  <p>  The Taxonomy Regulation entered into force in July 2020 and the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation took effect from March 2021. My Department recently concluded negotiations of the Regulation establishing the Public Sector Loan Facility, the third pillar of the Just Transition Mechanism expected to mobilise &euro;25bn to 30bn in public investment over the 2021-2027 period. </p>  <p>  Since 27 June 2020, my Department has transposed the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (EU) 2019/879, the Capital Requirements Directive (EU) 2019/878 and elements of the Capital Requirements Regulation (EU) 2019/876. In November 2020, Statutory Instrument 525 of 2020 was signed to amend the Interchange Fee Regulations to fully align with EU regulations. Negotiations on Regulation (EU) 2020/1503 on European crowdfunding service providers for business, amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 and Directive (EU) 2019/1937 concluded and the Directive was transposed in April 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department completed the drawdown of &euro;1.5bn from the National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund to the Exchequer&rsquo;s Central Fund at the end of October 2020. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 was signed into law in December 2020 to allow credit unions to hold General Meetings remotely and to provide more flexibility in voting methods.</p>  <p>  In line with its strategic goal of promoting environmentally sustainable economic progress, my Department has increased its capacity for managing the climate action agenda at a cross-departmental, EU and international level, including the Senior Officials Group on Climate, ECOFIN and the Coalition of Finance Minsters for Climate Action. My Department is actively participating in the interdepartmental structures established to develop the updated Climate Action Plan 2021.</p>  <p>  In the period to March 2021, my Department supported the migration of Ireland&rsquo;s securities settlement system from the UK to Belgium. This project saw over &euro;100bn worth of securities migrated. My Department introduced dedicated legislation and coordinated with national and EU authorities. The securities settlement migration means that Ireland remains well connected to the EU&rsquo;s capital markets with the stable investment and legislative environment that comes with it. </p>  <p>  The Investment Limited Partnerships (Amendment) Act 2020 was signed into law on 23 December 2020. This will enhance the development of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services (IFS) sector. My colleague, Minister of State Se&aacute;n Fleming TD, officially launched the Ireland for Finance Action Plan for 2021 ahead of the sixth annual European Financial Forum in February 2021.  </p>  <p>  In November 2020, I published the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group&rsquo;s (IDPRTG) Report on supplementary pensions. The work will inform pension debates and future policymaking which will in turn have wider, longer-term socio-economic and fiscal benefits. The Report contains forty-two recommendations and conclusions. The IDPRTG is working on a number of those recommendations for implementation later this year. </p>  <p>  A requirement at EU level was introduced that the forthcoming EU package of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) reforms must be compatible with common law and a registration and supervision regime was introduced for virtual assets service providers for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism purposes, the scope of which is more advanced and robust than the 5th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive requirements and places Ireland ahead of EU obligations in this area.</p>  <p>  The Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market has been created and is chaired by Minister of State Fleming.</p>  <p>  Development and operation of the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme, in particular the wage subsidy schemes, the TWSS and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) have been central pillars of the Government&rsquo;s response to the pandemic. When the TWSS ended last August, nearly 70,000 employers and over 600,000 employees had been supported. Additionally, the tax debt warehousing scheme has been placed on a statutory footing and expanded; an enhanced Help-to-Buy incentive scheme was introduced in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020 and subsequently extended until end 2021; the valuation date for Local Property Tax (LPT) has been deferred until 1 November 2021; and a revised method for calculating taxpayers&rsquo; LPT liabilities was developed. The General Scheme of Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill was approved by Government. </p>  <p>  Finance Act 2020 was enacted giving legislative form to the taxation proposals in the Budget 2021 Statement. Measures included a trajectory of annual increases in the rate of carbon tax leading to a rate of &euro;100 per tonne of carbon dioxide by 2030; increase of the Earned Income Credit from &euro;1,500 to &euro;1,650 - delivering on the commitment to equalise this with the employee tax credit; the introduction of an accelerated capital allowances scheme for farm safety and disability adaptation equipment and legislative defensive measures to apply to the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  In January 2021, an update to the Corporation Tax Roadmap was published. Progress continued on the transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, with the publication in December 2020 of a Feedback Statement on the Article 4 Interest Limitation Rule, in advance of legislation in Finance Bill 2021.</p>  <p>  On 19 May 2021, in response to a need to provide a significant disincentive to the multiple purchase by institutional investors of large parts of or whole housing estates before they reach the market, I introduced, by way of a Financial Resolution, a new measure which applies, subject to certain conditions and reliefs, a 10% stamp duty charge on bulk purchases (i.e. 10 or more in any 12-month period) of houses. This took effect from midnight that day.</p>  <p>  Finally, I have established the Commission on Taxation and Welfare which has begun its work.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s Disability Liaison Officer works closely with the National Disability Authority to ensure that it is fully compliant with its obligations under the Disability Act 2005. My Department has held awareness presentations on Autism and Dyslexia in the Workplace and has recently rolled out Diversity 3.0 Workshops to all staff. Recruitment to my Department from outside of the Civil Service is conducted through the Public Appointments Service. Where my Department recruits internally or through the Civil Service Mobility scheme, this is conducted in accordance with the Commission for Public Service Appointments Code of Practice.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the bodies under the aegis of my Department, it should be noted that not all of the bodies have employees. The position in relation to those bodies which have direct employees is set out below.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has a Diversity and Inclusion Policy Statement and Action Plan in place. The Bank has a number of partnerships and programmes aimed at attracting and hiring diverse talent. It has a partnership with the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) and participates in their &lsquo;Willing and Able Mentoring&rsquo; (WAM) Programme which promotes access to the labour market for graduates with disabilities and builds the capacity of employers to integrate disability into the mainstream workplace. The Bank has engaged with the National Council for the Blind Ireland to facilitate work placements and conduct mock interviews. The Central Bank provides reasonable accommodations throughout the recruitment process to support candidates with disabilities and this is communicated to all job applicants. Training and supports are in place for staff participating in the recruitment/interview process to ensure that a consistent, fair and inclusive experience is maintained. The Bank has established an internal Docklands Inclusion Group which supports and enables employment in the Dublin's Docklands community. Some of the initiatives run by the group include participation in the North East Inner City Transition Year Work Placement and Flash Mentoring Programme; engagement with the local community on their Bridging the Gap and Scholarship programmes; and Career LEAP (a work-readiness programme for young adults based in Dublin's Docklands/North Inner City who are not in education, employment or training). The Bank has hosted the Docklands Careers Fair aimed at supporting and enabling employment for the local Docklands community. The Bank recently launched a new Gender Identity and Expression in the Workplace Policy which was published and communicated externally. The Bank is enhancing its focus on ethnic and cultural diversity and supported the creation of a new employee-led Cultural Diversity Network last year. The Central Bank provides staffing to the Investor Compensation Company DAC which is also a body under the aegis of my Department.</p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) operates its recruitment campaigns in compliance with the Codes of Practice for Appointment to Positions in the Civil Service and Public Service and is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for prospective candidates. The FSPO encourages applications under all nine grounds of the Employment Equality Acts and offers reasonable accommodation to current and prospective employees with disabilities. A staff census undertaken in 2020 indicated that, at 8.23%, the FSPO exceeded the minimum requirement set out in the Disability Act 2005 in relation to the level of employment of people with disabilities. The FSPO continues to enhance practices in this area and has emphasised the requirement to achieve an inclusive and diverse workplace over the course of the next strategic period.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency&rsquo;s (NTMA) Inclusion &amp;amp; Diversity networks are organised by communities of colleagues who work together to drive their progress in these areas. The NTMA partners with specialist recruiters, and attends specialist recruitment fairs. It also partners with external organisations to promote the employment of people from underrepresented minorities such as ShoutOut, Trinity Centre for People with Intellectual Disabilities (TCPID), AHEAD, Specialisterne, Down Syndrome Ireland, NCBI and Open Doors, who create pathways to work through training, education and employment for refugee, asylum seekers and non-native English speakers, young people under 25 with educational barriers, people with a disability and members of the travelling community. The NTMA was awarded a WAM Leadership Award for promoting the employment of graduates with a disability in 2020. Their Disability Awareness Team (DAT) works with business units to recruit roles for persons with a disability. Candidates recruited through DAT are assigned a mentor. In relation to gender balance, the NTMA works with recruitment partners to identify 30% representation of each gender for shortlists. Recruitment advertisements are entered into a job description decoder which ensures gender neutral language, the NTMA fields mixed interview panels and has a flexible working framework. The NTMA provides staffing for Home Building Finance Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland which are also bodies under the aegis of my Department.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General (OCAG) advertises all vacancies on its website. The website is enabled with software, &lsquo;Recite me&rsquo;, which reads the site, translates and/or increases the size of the text to provide information to visually or audibly impaired persons who may wish to apply for vacancies. Currently just under 8% of staff have self-declared a disability. Two apprentices from Accounting Technicians Ireland commenced with OCAG in early 2021 on a two year apprenticeship programme. OCAG plans to engage transition year students as part of the NEIC Initiative as part of the 2021 or 2022 work placement cycle and has recently decided to review the possibility of engagement with the Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) and WAM programmes. The OWL programme is an unpaid learning and development programme for young adults with an intellectual disability.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as an equal opportunities employer, their competitions for employment are organised in accordance with the Code of Practice 'Appointment to Positions in the Civil Service and Public Service' published by the Commissioners for Public Service Appointments (CPSA).  In line with the CPSA Code of Practice, appointments to Revenue are carried out through fair, transparent and merit-based selection processes, are made on the basis of the ability to carry out the responsibilities of the grade or post and where necessary, on the basis of qualifications also. Applicants with disabilities are accommodated and supported throughout the recruitment processes. Additionally, where necessary, Revenue is committed to providing workplace accommodations on an individual basis, including assistive technology and office equipment to staff with disabilities. The majority of Revenue offices countrywide are adapted for use by staff with physical disabilities. Furthermore, Revenue offers paid internships for persons with disabilities such as the Specialisterne Ireland and the AHEAD WAM Programmes. In recognition of its contribution to the WAM programme, Revenue received a &lsquo;Leader&rsquo; award at the Building for the Future/WAM Awards in 2017 and continues to actively participate in this initiative. Revenue offers apprenticeships in the areas of Accounting Technician and Information Communication and Technology. Following successful completion of these, candidates are afforded an opportunity to secure full-time permanent positions. Finally, in line with Revenue&rsquo;s mission to ensure an accessible, respectful, and fair environment for its staff, Revenue conducted a staff survey in May 2021 which included the collection of information on the diverse composition of their workforce. Responses from this survey will enable Revenue to better understand, anticipate and respond to the needs of its staff. </p>  <p>  The Tax Appeals Commission conducts its recruitment campaigns through the Government&rsquo;s Public Appointments Service. Any request for staff does not differentiate between persons from minority or disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is an equal opportunities employer which is committed to selection on merit.</p></reply>

In order to provide enhanced scope for Departments and Offices to manage staffing levels and composition within their allocated financial resources, a policy of delegated sanction was introduced by Government in 2015 in relation to staff management, including recruitment.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is the principal recruiter for appointments to the civil service.All recruitment is demand-led and PAS undertakes competitions on behalf of the civil service to establish recruitment panels that may be drawn upon as general service vacancies arise in Government Departments or Offices across the country.  Individual recruitment campaigns may be undertaken for more specialised professional or technical posts as the need arises.  </p><p>As set out in the table below, PAS has confirmed that it presently has 15 requests on hand from Government Departments or Offices to fill civil service vacancies in the Waterford region: <table>    <tr>       <th>Grade </th>       <th>No. of vacant posts being filled by PAS at present </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Temporary Clerical Officer </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clerical Officer </td>       <td>11 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Executive Officer </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Higher Executive Officer </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>9 of the Clerical Officer posts related to a bulk intake request that PAS has recently received from Revenue.  Of the 15 requests on hand, 13 were received by PAS this month.  </p><p>The timeframe to fill some roles may be impacted in a number of ways.  This can include, for example, specific conditions to be satisfied during candidate clearance including Garda Vetting in instances where individuals have lived overseas, where there are delays in candidates providing supporting documentation or if candidates withdraw from a competition in the final stages of the recruitment process.</p></reply>

In particular it has sought evidence to support any claims that the reductions imposed are linked to significant recruitment and retention issues, thereby potentially adversely impacting the administration of justice.  While my Department has not yet been provided with evidential data to support such claims., it remains available to review any further information that may be provided. </p>  <p>  My Department has also sought advices from the Attorney General's Office as to whether the State has an obligation in relation to these professional fees.  My Department will continue to keep this issue under review and engage with key stakeholders, as appropriate. </p>  <p>  As it relates to the matter of State Solicitor pay, it should be noted that pay rates here differ from fees paid to counsel by the State. State Solicitor pay has an established link with the Assistant Principal or AP grade within the Civil Service - it comprises a personal element for the individual State Solicitor which is equivalent to the AP salary, a staffing element related to Clerical Officer grade and an expenses element that increases in relation to certain Consumer Price Index movements. The personal and staffing elements currently attract changes as per National Wage Agreements.</p></reply>

In addition to publishing the strategy, the launch provided an opportunity to highlight a number of projects undertaken across the Civil Service which show the important work carried out by civil servants up and down the country, particularly in responding to the challenges the country has faced over the last 18 months.</p>  <p>  The strategy provides an ambitious framework for the future for the Civil Service and its staff.  It builds on the strengths of the Civil Service and the initiatives delivered under the first Civil Service Renewal Plan and provides a long term framework to continuously improve. It is focused on achieving meaningful outcomes for society, the Government and stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The strategy&rsquo;s vision is for &lsquo;an innovative, professional and agile Civil Service that improves the lives of the people of Ireland through excellence in service delivery and strategic policy development&rsquo;.  It has three core themes: delivering evidenced-informed policy and services, harnessing digital technology and innovation, and building the workforce, workplace and organisation of the future. </p>  <p>  The strategy&rsquo;s development is the result of an extensive consultation process informed by experience and expertise from across the Civil Service. A Taskforce of senior officials, representing all of the Civil Service Management Board (CSMB) Departments and Offices, have shaped the Strategy. It also draws on evidence collected from staff engagement during the implementation of the first Civil Service Renewal Plan and the results of the 2020 Civil Service Employee Engagement Survey.  It is also informed by the lessons learned in the six Organisational Capability Reviews completed to date and from the Civil and Public Service response to the challenges of COVID-19.  The strategy acknowledges the environment in which the Civil Service operates and identifies important challenges facing the Civil Service now and in the future.</p>  <p>  The strategy will be implemented through a cycle of three-year action plans and work is underway on the first plan which will set out the priorities for the next 3 years. The first action plan will be published in the autumn.</p></reply>

As part of this statutory process, stakeholders were afforded a formal opportunity to provide comments on the environmental element of the proposed works.

The project team for the Crossmolina Flood Relief Scheme are now compiling responses and supplementary information for DPER and will respond with the additional requested information in July. Once DPER receive this material, they will in turn need to review this material prior to granting Statutory Confirmation of the Scheme. We cannot provide an indicative timeline for this stage as it is outside of our control. </p><p>Subject to a satisfactory conclusion of DPER's Consultation and Independent Review, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will give statutory consent to the scheme, allowing the project team to bring the Crossmolina Flood Relief Scheme to construction. Subject to confirmation, it is currently anticipated that the OPW construction crew will be in a position to commence advance construction works this year. These are indicative timelines and may vary depending on the confirmation process and favourable ground conditions. </p><p>Once DPER/MPER have completed their review, further information will be provided on the project website, which is available at: </p></reply>

The Civil Service is strongly committed to equality of opportunity for all in terms of its recruitment and employment practices.  This commitment is demonstrated in the <i>Civil Service</i><i>2030 Renewal Strategy</i>that was launched last month.</p><p>The Public Appointments Services (PAS), which is an body under the aegis of my Department, is the principal recruiter for the Civil Service.  PAS plays a central role in attracting a diverse range of talented people from all backgrounds to take up employment opportunities in the Civil Service.</p><p>PAS has established a dedicated Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Unit and embedded Diversity Champions throughout the organisation.  In March 2021, PAS launched its first <i>Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy 2021-2023</i>following extensive and ongoing engagements with NGOs, including representatives from organisations including, for example, Mi-Wow, New Communities Partnership, AkiDwA, Business In The Community, the National Youth Council, the Immigrant Council of Ireland as well as groups representing members of the Traveller and Roma communities.</p><p><b>Employment of people with disabilities</b></p><p>Officials from my Department and from PAS sit on the Implementation Group for the National Comprehensive Employment Strategy for the Employment of People with Disabilities 2015-2024.  This national strategy commits to increase the percentage of staff with a disability from 3% to 6% by 2024 (presently 3% under the Disability Act 2005).  This employment target is monitored by the National Disability Authority.  At the end of 2019, 5.1% of civil servants self-declared as having a disability.  Data at the end of 2020 is presently being collated for return to the NDA.</p><p>There are many positive examples under CES of how my Department, working alongside key stakeholders in the Civil Service including PAS, has been involved in promoting civil service employment pathways for persons with a disability.  These include:</p><p><i>Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) Programme</i></p><p>In partnership with AHEAD, this offers graduates with a disability a 6 month mentored paid work placement in either the private sector or Civil Service.  My Department and PAS play a key role in driving the annual intakes of work placements across the Cvil Service.  To date, WAM has placed over 490 graduates, of which 47% (230) have been placements across 33 Departments/Offices. Over 80% of WAM graduates have subsequently secured longer-term employment upon completion of their WAM programme.  Officials from my Department are presently scoping the possibility of a confined competition to create permanent civil service employment opportunities for graduates of the WAM programme.</p><p><i>Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) Programme</i></p><p>OWL is an applied learning, development and socialisation programme for adults with an intellectual disability that was launched as a pilot programme in September 2018. It is facilitated by the Houses of the Oireachtas Service in collaboration with two sponsor organisations, KARE and WALK.  The goal of the Programme is to provide trainees with the skills, knowledge and ability to gain meaningful employment via the unique opportunity to gain practical work experience, as well as accredited learning over an 11 month period.  Over a quarter of the initial OWL interns have since gone on to secure permanent civil service employment through confined competitions. </p><p><b>Employment of people from ethnic minority and socially disadvantage backgrounds including members of the Traveller and Roma Community</b></p><p>The Department of Children, Equality, Diversity, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY) is leading out on the Migrant Integration Strategy 2017-2021 that set a minimum 1% employment target for the people of ethnic minority/EEA migrant status.  </p><p>PAS have recently undertaken a review of general competitions in 2020 at all levels within the Civil Service to review the number of applicants from ethnic minority backgrounds that applied for, and were successful in, competitions.  This information is set out in the table below.</p><p>Officials from my Department are participating on a Joint Working Group with officials from DCEDIY to progress a number of Programme for Government commitments in this area, including the development of paid internships.  It is planned to leverage the positive experience of the OWL and WAM Programmes by partnering with NGOs.  My Department and PAS, for example, are presently supporting the introduction of a pilot paid internship programme for members of the Traveller and Roma Community by the Department of Justice.</p><p>Officials from my Department and PAS have also recently made submissions to, and appeared before, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community in relation to recent initiatives to promote employment opportunities in the civil service.  </p><p>OneLearning, the Civil Service Learning and Development Shared Service Centre based within my Department, is in the process of tendering for its second generation of training courses for civil servants following extensive stakeholder engagement, including participating by representatives of IHREC.It is envisaged that a number of additional training courses on equality, diversity and inclusion will be developed for civil servants will come on stream and will include courses on the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty.</p><p>Under Action 16 of Our Public Service 2020, my Department has also recently developed and launched an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Vision Statement and Maturity Model for the Public Service.</p><p>In terms of civil servants based in my own Department, the HR Unit developed the <i>People@PER HR Strategy</i>that has a focus on embracing and embedding a culture of diversity and inclusion across the Department through diversity initiatives and training.  This has included the establishment of a vibrant cross-Divisional and cross-grade Diversity and Inclusion staff forum, the PERspectives Group.  My Department has a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) who supports new members of staff with a disability or existing staff who acquire a disability and raise awareness about disability.  New hires receive the Code of Practice for the Employment of People with a Disability in the Irish Civil Service, a welcome letter from the Department&rsquo;s DLO and FAQs on Disability prepared by the National Disability Authority.  The induction of new hires includes a presentation and Q&amp;amp;A session with the DLO.</p><p>In September 2020, I published a <i>State Bodies Code of Practice Annex of Gender Balance, Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion</i>.  This requires the Chairperson of each board to submit a comprehensive report to the relevant Minister each year that must set out progress in addressing gender equality and diversity issues.  </p><p>In terms of bodies under my aegis, all have appointed Disability Liaison Officers (DLOs) and have proactively made available work placement opportunities for participants on the WAM and OWL programmes, with a number of these being converted to permanent positions.  Embedding diversity and inclusion with each body is a core focus of the respective Management Boards with key ED&amp;amp;I initiatives reflected in existing local HR strategies or those being developed by bodies, such as the EMPOWER People Strategy in the case of the Office of Government Procurement.</p><p>I am committed to ensuring that we continue to build a diverse Civil Service that is reflective of the modern Ireland that we serve.</p><p><b>In the case of Candidates that voluntarily identified to PAS as being from an ethnic minority background</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>2020 Civil Service Competition </th>       <th>Total Applications for Competition </th>       <th>Number of such candidates at application stage </th>       <th>% total applicants for competition at application stage </th>       <th>Number od such candidates subsequently placed on panel </th>       <th>% of successful candidates subsequently placed on panel for assignment to a civil service employer </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Temporary Clerical Officer </td>       <td>7,437 </td>       <td>178 </td>       <td>2.4% </td>       <td>70 </td>       <td>2.4% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clerical Officer </td>       <td>26,356 </td>       <td>481 </td>       <td>1.8% </td>       <td>14 </td>       <td>1.8% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Executive Officer </td>       <td>14,602 </td>       <td>344 </td>       <td>2.4% </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>.01% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Administrative Officer (Graduate entry) </td>       <td>8,259 </td>       <td>619 </td>       <td>7.5% </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>4.4% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Assistant Principal </td>       <td>3,821 </td>       <td>30 </td>       <td>0.8% </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1.1% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Principal Officer </td>       <td>1,754 </td>       <td>16 </td>       <td>0.9% </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1.5% </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Its remit includes, but is not limited to, considering opportunities to introduce reforms within the sector that will help in controlling construction price inflation.  </p>  <p>  To support the work of the CSG an annual Build Report was produced by my Department in 2019 and 2020. The purpose of this report is to give a comprehensive overview of the performance and prospects of the Irish construction sector, based on the available official statistics and data. The report aids in monitoring of trends across the sector, ranging from output and investment to employment and cost inflation, so that risks and performance issues can be identified and addressed where necessary.</p>  <p>  Inflation measures how much more expensive a set of goods and services becomes over a certain period of time. A number of measures relating to inflation in the Irish construction sector are detailed in the Build Report. The data included in the report is mostly obtained from the Central Statistics Office.</p>  <p>  Two major costs for the construction industry are the cost of materials and the cost of wages. </p>  <p>  Inflation in the cost of construction materials can be measured through the Wholesale Price Index. As for the wage inflation, this has been measured by monitoring average hourly earnings for the construction sector. </p>  <p>  The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for Building and Construction Materials provides a general indication of price trends in the sector. WPI essentially measures the changes in the prices of goods sold and traded in bulk. In April 2021 the WPI for Building and Construction Materials stood at 3.4% on an annual basis. However within this there are certain materials which have seen elevated levels of inflation such as timber and steel.</p>  <p>  Average Hourly earnings for the construction sector (includes all employees of construction) increased by 9% between Q1 2020 and Q2 2021. </p>  <p>  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland Tender Price index reveals that national construction tender prices increased by 1.3% in the second half of 2020, up from 0.9% in the previous 6 months. The results indicate a slight rebound of tender price growth in the construction sector, with national annual inflation now at 2.2% (Jan 2020 to Dec 2020), however it is still significantly less than tender price inflation levels pre-Covid. The Index is the only independent assessment of construction tender prices in Ireland. It is compiled by the Quantity Surveying members of the Society. The Tender Price Index (TPI) is based largely on sentiment returns with actual tender returns included in the calculations. The TPI is for non-residential projects during the period in question. It is based on predominately new build projects with values in excess of &euro; 0.5m and covers all regions of Ireland. The Index relates to average price increases across differing project types and locations.</p>  <p>  Overall, while there was elevated construction sector inflation in 2019, construction price inflation slowed overall in 2020 as a result of Covid-19. Elevated levels of inflation possesses risk for the construction sector and wider economy as a whole by undermining value for money.  </p>  <p>  The impacts of this on the delivery and cost of major capital health projects is a matter for the Minister for Health. Under the delegated capital sanction provided to Departments each year they are expected to make programme and project contingency provision, factoring inflation along with other risks into their budgeting. </p>  <p>  There is no cost adjustment available for inflation under the public works contractsuntil a period of 2.5 years after the contract is awarded.  As part of the tender process contractors are expected to price for inflation which has typically been 5 &ndash; 7% per annum in recent years.</p></reply>

In view of the significant and pervasive impacts experienced as a consequence of the Covid19 crisis, the Government's programme of reform and modernisation will become especially more relevant as we seek to return our economy and society to full recovery.</p><p>In accordance with the Department's Statement of Strategy, officials are currently preparing the next phase of public service reform (to succeed <i>Our Public Service 2020</i>) which will incorporate priorities that were articulated in the recently published Public Service Innovation Strategy, <i>Making Innovation Real </i>and sets its focus on the wider Public Service.<i></i>My Department has also recently published an ambitious programme of renewal for the Civil Service <i>(CSR 2030)</i>. Additionally, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer in my Department is currently finalising a new Public Service Digital Strategy, which will be published in the coming months.</p><p>These new plans and strategies will reinvigorate the reform agenda and make certain that we capitalise on the positive changes that we have witnessed since the onset of the pandemic. They will also incorporate a number of Programme for Government commitments that will further enable the Public Service to be more responsive to the future needs of our citizens and to be resilient to any similar economic shocks of this nature.</p><p>As regards the drive for more value for money, the generation of efficiencies and the realisation of more cost-effective public services, all public organisations are required to treat public funds with care, and to ensure that the best possible value for money is obtained whenever public money is being spent or invested. This is in accordance with the Public Spending Code. Moreover, Action 5 of <i>Our Public Service 2020 </i>(Action 5) emphasises the need to ensure value-for-money principles are adhered to across the Public Service. </p><p>As part of this broader approach to ensuring value for money, the introduction of shared services and centralised procurement in earlier phases of reform have been further integrated in public service operations and expanded into new areas. These expansions will continue apace and this Department is actively exploring new areas and mechanisms to further embed reforms that will enhance the cost-effectiveness of public services; for example, through greater use of opportunities presented through digitalisation, intelligent automation, innovation and the implementation of new ways of working and service design.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that by agreeing to the Public Service Pay Agreement &lsquo;<i>Building Momentum</i>&rsquo;, parties have committed to the ongoing reform and development of public services to meet the changing needs of citizens, communities, businesses and the staff who deliver our public services.</p><p>Parties have agreed to maintain the momentum for reform and to continue co-operation with regard to flexibility and change to support effective responses to the challenges posed by COVID-19, recognising the need to look beyond traditional ways of working, where necessary and appropriate, and to manage change to ensure high quality public services, high performance, the maintenance and development of staff skills and competencies, and the delivery of measurable outcomes for the public.</p></reply>

The publication of the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF) in 2007 marked a new departure in the procurement of public works projects. All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the Government's capital plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the CWMF, which is mandated by circular. The CWMF provides an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures that cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements. The use of the framework results in a more cost effective delivery of public works projects because of the systematic and detailed approach to, amongst other things, planning (both preparatory and detailed), and capital budgeting as well as design and construction cost control. The process required under the CWMF reflects the balance that must be struck in awarding a public contract between value for money and a quality project outcome. All the documents that make up the framework are available online at: constructionprocurement.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  A 2014 review of a key element of the CWMF, the public works contracts highlighted a number of areas that were contributing to poor project outcomes including cost increases.  Poor definition of the project requirements was identified as one of the main sources of claims under the contracts, claims that were often upheld in the dispute resolution procedures under the contract.  A range of interim measures were introduced in 2016 in response to the recommendations set out at the culmination of the review.</p>  <p>  A broader review of the policies and practices deployed in the procurement of public works projects commenced in March 2019.  The focus of the review is on improving the delivery of construction projects in terms of quality, timely delivery and cost outcomes.  </p>  <p>  The review will deliver significant changes to the CWMF over the coming years.

These rules govern the way public authorities and certain utility operators purchase goods, works and services. </p>  <p>  The rules are set out in four principal EU Directives (Directive 2009/81/EC, Directive 2014/23/EU; Directive 2014/24/EU and Directive 2014/25/EU) which are transposed into national legislation in each Member State.  These rules govern the conduct of public procurement procedures for public contracts whose monetary value exceeds a certain threshold.   Public contracts applying below those threshold values are, nonetheless, expected to conform with principles of public procurement set out in the Directives, in particular equal treatment, non-discrimination, mutual recognition, proportionality and transparency.</p>  <p>  Legal oversight of the procurement rules is set out in a further set of Directives governing review and remedy procedures for interested parties to a public procurement procedure.  These Directives -  89/665/EEC, 92/13/EEC, 2007/66/EC &ndash; have been transposed into national legislation in each Member State and operate through a range of administrative and judicial bodies.</p>  <p>  The uniformity of the procurement regime across the EU, established by the full suite of procurement-related Directives, is further reinforced by important procurement principles emerging from the case law in each Member State and from the Court of Justice of the European Union in the area of public procurement.</p>  <p>  To further enhance coordination and coherence of approach across the EU, each Member State, including Ireland, is represented at the several EU Commission expert groups on procurement.  These groups are designed to ensure a consistency of governance in public procurement and to guide ongoing developments in the area.  Through the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), my Department is committed to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s procurement policy is fully aligned with other Member States.</p></reply>

The position regarding gross general government debt against GDP also improved over this time period, from 104.4% of GDP at the end of 2014 to 57.4% of GDP at the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  Underpinning this fiscal strategy was the policy of sustainable annual increases in public expenditure during this timeframe, with gross voted expenditure increasing by a total of &euro;13.1 billion or 24%, from &euro;54.1 billion in 2014 to &euro;67.2 billion in 2019. Over this period, to allow for the delivery of key infrastructure projects, there was a clear focus on increasing levels of capital investment by the State.</p>  <p>  The decisions made in recent budgets have ensured that we had the financial resources to act in response to Covid-19 and to provide substantial supports to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic during 2020 and for 2021, with some &euro;28 billion allocated to date across the two years for support measures.</p>  <p>  For 2021, the Revised Estimates for Public Services (REV) outlined an overall Government Expenditure Ceiling of &euro;87.8 billion, which included almost &euro;12 billion in funding to respond to Covid-19. Within this overall expenditure ceiling, &euro;5.4 billion was set aside in reserve to be used as required during the year for temporary, targeted measures to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  This reserve was partially allocated as part of Further Revised Estimates agreed by Government in April, with almost &euro;4.3 billion in additional funding provided to the Departments of Social Protection; Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and Rural and Community Development for measures in response to the impact of Covid-19. In addition to this, additional Departmental Estimates will be presented to the D&aacute;il in due course reflecting the various measures set out in the National Economic Recovery Plan.</p>  <p>  It is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister to manage expenditure within their respective allocations, particularly given the exceptional level of funding being provided this year, and careful monitoring of spending against profile and of progress on programmes and projects is required. My Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices regarding this.</p>  <p>  Based on Departmental Estimates presented to the D&aacute;il to date and as set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, total gross voted expenditure to end-May 2021 amounted to nearly &euro;33 billion. While this is nearly &euro;1&frac12; billion ahead on the same period in 2020, the public health restrictions in place this year have impacted on spending plans of departments. Accordingly, gross voted expenditure is running almost &euro;1.4 billion or 4% below profile.</p>  <p>  In 2021 the main spending Departments will be reporting to Government quarterly on spending within their areas. This stands alongside a range of reforms implemented in recent years in order to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary framework and to ensure efficient and effective management of public expenditure. Looking forward, the Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the Budgetary process, building on the budgetary reforms already in place and the significant work on public service reform already completed.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, inflationary pressures continue to be dealt with on a year-by-year basis as part of the normal budgetary process. The rationale for this approach is clear, where the non-application of price increases can be used as a mechanism to generate efficiency dividends and promote productivity where State bodies are effectively challenged to maintain the existing levels of service without making specific provision for indexation.  As the economy recovers from the impact of the pandemic, this is an area that we will need to keep under review to ensure that value for money is delivered across Government projects and programmes.</p></reply>

Many of these sectors have experienced  severe impacts due to the global Covid-19 pandemic and associated public health measures my Department has continued to make significant progress across all areas of its brief.  Further information in relation to policy announcements, consultations and schemes is available on my Department's website at  ()</p><p>I have recently been able to join with my Government colleagues in making a series of positive announcements  in relation to the safe and successful reopening of our society including the reopening of the hospitality and tourism sector; returning to in-person cultural and sporting events; the easing of restrictions on sports and dance training; and the reopening of galleries, museums and libraries.</p><p>Following on from the Budget 2021 which included funding of &euro;130m for the Arts Council,  &euro;104.5m for Sport Ireland, over &euro;30m for Screen Ireland, over &euro;78m the Gaeltacht and Irish language sector and &euro;40.733m for TG4. There was a record level of funding for Tourism overall in Budget 2021, an increase of &euro;59 million over 2020 allocation, to just under &euro;221 million (&euro;220.9 million).</p><p>Specific policy achievements include:</p><p>- The establishment of a Tourism Recovery Oversight Group and an Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce and ensuing oversight group, to chart a sustainable path for recovery of Ireland's tourism, arts,  culture and entertainment sectors.</p><p>- Secured an extensive package of supports for the functions under the remit of her Department in the July 2020 Jobs Stimulus Package. </p><p>- The inclusion in budget 2021 of a &euro;55m support fund for strategic tourism businesses and &euro;5m for training and digitalisation support in the sector.</p><p>- &euro;26m COVID-19 Adaptation Fund for tourism and hospitality business. </p><p>- &euro;10m Coach Business Continuity Scheme.</p><p>- &euro;10m Ireland Based Inbound Agents Business Continuity Scheme. </p><p>- These measures complement the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Covid Restrictions Support Scheme schemes and the ReStart scheme. </p><p>- The  new &euro;17m Outdoor Dining Enhancement Scheme being delivered in partnership between F&aacute;&iacute;lte Ireland and Local Authorities across the country. This scheme is providing funding for tourism and hospitality business to develop and increase their own outdoor seating capacity, and will also provide funding to local authorities to develop permanent outdoor public dining spaces in towns and urban centres, similar to those that exist in various European cities.</p><p>- Announcement of a  Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme for artists, as part of the Government&rsquo;s  National Economic Recovery Plan.  This was the number one recommendation from artists and the sector through the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce Report-Life Worth living.  My Cabinet colleague Minister Heather Humphreys in the Department of Social Protection and I will be developing a proposal for the Basic Income guarantee pilot scheme by July. This is an unprecedented move and I anticipate that the pilot scheme will involve a significant number of artists.</p><p>- A Covid-19 funding package of &euro;88.5m was provided in 2020 to support the sport sector. This significant investment benefited all levels of the sport sector, including thousands of grassroots clubs across the country.</p><p>- An allocation of &euro;5.9million in Dormant Accounts Funding for a wide range of sport and physical activity measures countrywide, focusing on people with disabilities, people who are educationally disadvantaged and from disadvantaged communities.</p><p>- A new High Performance Strategy for the Sporting sector, to be launched in the coming weeks.</p><p>- The  Live Performance Support Scheme for 2021, under which &euro;25m is being provided to support employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres of live entertainment and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. </p><p>- Launch of the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme under which a fund of &euro;14m is available to  businesses in the live entertainment sector that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 restrictions.</p><p>- The continued safeguarding and modernisation of institutions through the National Cultural Institutions (NCIs)  Investment Programme in the National Development Plan, an ambitious programme of capital investment across all of our NCIs which will ensure that they can continue their legacy of providing engaging cultural and artistic offerings to the people of Ireland.  The National Development Plan also includes funding for a cultural and creativity investment programme.</p><p>- The 2020 round of the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme closed for applications on the 1<sup>st</sup>March. Assessment work is underway with allocations expected later this year. Work is also advancing on projects being funded under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund.</p><p>- The progress  of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, which is now undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny. </p><p>- The publication of a full suite of guidelines in relation to the safe resumption of activities across the tourism, hospitality, sport and cultural sectors. </p><p>- The announcement of a series of outdoor pilot events in sports and live entertainment to provide for the safe return of spectators and audiences. </p><p>- The establishment of a language planning fund worth &euro;3.4m in total for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge to maintain the operation of the language planning process in the current year</p><p>- The progress  of the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill which has now passed Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>- Public consultation  on the designation of certain sporting and cultural events as being of major importance to society and to ensure that they are available on free to air television service on a live or deferred basis. </p><p>- The establishment of the Future of Media Commission jointly with the Taoiseach, securing additional funding for TG4 and securing of Government approval for the integration of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill into the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.</p><p>- The establishment of a Night Time Economy Taskforce, the final report of which I intend to bring to Government shortly. </p><p>In addition to sector specific supports, my Department and I have worked closely across Government to ensure that COVID-19 horizontal supports reflect the needs of the sectors under the aegis of the Department, and the combination of sector specific and horizontal supports are detailed in the Government's recently published Economic Recovery Plan. </p><p>The policy initiatives to date reflect a strong combination of measures to support key sectors throughout the pandemic, as well as longer term policy initiatives in response to Programme for Government commitments, and that aim to chart a sustainable future for the sectors under the aegis of my Department.</p></reply>

The Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020 provide for a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the counties of Donegal and Mayo only, to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to the use of defective concrete blocks. The scheme opened for applications at the end of June 2020.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides funding of &euro;20 million to fund the operation of the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme for the counties of Donegal and Mayo. As of 11 June 2021, a total of 448 "Stage 1 - Confirmation of Eligibility" applications have been made, of which 296 have been approved.

Delivery on this commitment is evidenced in the new measures contained in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, currently before the Oireachtas, which provides for three schemes that will increase the supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, and (3) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme.</p><p>Affordable homes on local authority lands are to be made available through the support of the &euro;310 million Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). Information on the schemes that have received approval in principle under the Serviced Sites Fund are available at:</p><p>, and </p><p>.</p><p>In addition to the 35 SSF projects referenced in the links above, approval in principle has also been given to five additional projects - Emmet Road and Oscar Traynor Road (Dublin City Council), Shanganagh (D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council), Hayestown and Ballymastone (Fingal County Council).</p><p>Cumulatively, these 40 SSF projects, across 14 local authorities, will assist in the delivery of just over 4,400 affordable home to buy or rent. My Department continues to engage with local authorities to progress both current and potential projects, with the first SSF project to deliver affordable homes for purchase under the SSF later this year being the Boherboy project in Cork City. </p><p>In making an application for SSF funding, each local authority must demonstrate that an affordability issue exists in the area in question and that it is viable to deliver homes, for purchase or rent, with a price reduction of at least 10% below open market values, with the reduction remaining as fully-repayable equity charge against the property. The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers, with some limited exceptions as outlined in the Affordable Housing 2021 Bill. </p><p>In addition to the affordable homes to be delivered through the SSF, Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, which is aimed at first-time buyers buying a new-build home on private land. It will help these first-time buyers secure their own home by bridging the gap between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home they want. Work on the detailed design of the proposed scheme is ongoing and at an advanced stage.</p><p>The Affordable Housing Bill will also place a new form of tenure in Cost Rental on a statutory basis for the first time.  Cost Rental directly links rents to the cost of provision rather than market dynamics. Three initial Cost Rental projects are already underway. The first Cost Rental homes in Ireland, 50 two-bedroom apartments at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, will be delivered by the Tuath and Respond Approved Housing Bodies in Quarter 3 2021. Dublin City Council is also progressing a site at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate), and the LDA is collaborating with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on a site at Shanganagh, Shankill.</p><p>The provision of Cost Rental housing is also being implemented through the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, which was allocated &euro;35m in Budget 2021. I approved in principle the financing this year of 390 new homes across eight sites, located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, and Cork. CREL support and careful cost management has generated initial rents which are at least 25% below comparable open market prices, delivering significantly improved affordability for renters.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned measures in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, the Land Development Agency (LDA) is tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, state agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. In partnership with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, the LDA has been granted planning permission for the development of 597 homes on a site in Shanganagh.  Approximately 34% of the units will be for social housing, 51% will be cost rental and 15% will be for affordable purchase. Work has commenced on the construction tender process, with construction anticipated to start in the second half of 2021. Information on the work of the LDA is available at: .</p><p>On the 4<sup>th</sup>May last, the Government also approved the drafting of amending provisions to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for inclusion in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 as Committee Stage amendments. This will see an increase in the current 10% social housing requirement related to all new housing developments to a mandatory 20% for social and affordable requirements.</p><p>Other affordability measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme, and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are already available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.</p><p>The Help to Buy Scheme may return tax paid in the previous four years to eligible first-time buyers, up to a maximum amount of &euro;30,000, for a new home. Information is available at: .</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. There are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage. Further information on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available at .</p><p>Finally, I can confirm the Government&rsquo;s upcoming Housing strategy &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo; will detail an extensive range of measures and ambitious targets to underpin the delivery of affordable housing over the coming years.</p></reply>

Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.

In this regard, it would be advisable for the residents to confirm the nature of the pyrite problems in the area and that any problems identified stem from reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material which is giving rise to pyritic heave and consequential significant pyritic damage.</p><p>In regard to the Deputy's specific question, my Department has not engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to extending the pyrite remediation scheme to counties Mayo and Donegal.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The determination of whether an applicant household meets the income criteria is based on a calculation of their preceding 12 months&rsquo; net average income prior to the date of receipt of application. This ensures that the most comprehensive picture of a household&rsquo;s current and previous income is available at the point of carrying out the assessment.</p>  <p>  Social housing support is intended to address a household&rsquo;s long-term housing need and it is therefore important to note that where households are in need of short term support, such as Rent Supplement, they should make application to the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), Circular 38/2020 regarding the treatment of the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) when assessing and/or reviewing income eligibility for social housing support was issued to local authorities. The Circular advises that the PUP payment should be considered as temporary in the overall context of an applicant household's income. In this regard, when assessing a household, the household&rsquo;s income immediately prior to receipt of the PUP should be considered by the authority. Based on all of the available income information, the authority must then make a decision as to whether the household meets the income criteria. </p>  <p>  Decisions on the qualification of specific persons for social housing support and the allocation of that support are a matter solely for the local authority concerned.</p></reply>

It sets out rules for the marketing of construction products in the EU. Where a construction product covered by a harmonised standard is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.</p><p>The manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) and in particular for the Declaration of Performance/CE marking of the construction product he/she is placing on the market, having full knowledge of the raw material (as is legally required by the CPR via the relevant harmonised European Standards) and having regard to the end product&rsquo;s suitability for use in construction works in accordance with the relevant Standard Recommendations published by the NSAI.</p><p>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I.

In addition, Dublin City Council has been appointed as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions across the country and has created a Market Surveillance Unit within Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO).  Building control authorities will liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise.</p><p>The National market surveillance programme 2021 provides specific details on the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO, which has recently commenced, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR.</p></reply>

In this regard, we continually monitor tender cost trends through ongoing engagement with colleagues in local authorities and through engagement with other Departments and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.  My Department continues to work with each local authority to ensure that projects are developed and progressed in a cost effective manner.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific project mentioned, it is primarily one for resolution between the developer and the local authority concerned.

These actions are necessary to support our efforts to coordinate and scale up our international climate finance and to enhance our climate diplomacy efforts.</p><p>Ireland provides significant international climate finance, the vast majority of which is targeted towards Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. This targeting remains a commitment in the Interim Climate Action Plan. In 2019, the latest year for which figures are available, the Government of Ireland provided at least &euro;93.6 million in climate finance. The Department of Foreign Affairs provided the largest proportion of this finance, approximately &euro;71.3 million.</p><p>A full breakdown of Ireland's international climate spending can be found in <i>Ireland's Climate and Environmental Finance Report 2019</i>.</p><p>In line with the Programme for Government and Ireland&rsquo;s International Development Policy, A Better World, the Interim Climate Action Plan contains a number of commitments to be led by the Department of Foreign Affairs, including:</p><p>- seek to at least double the percentage of Official Development Assistance spending by 2030;</p><p>- the establishment of a Climate Finance Roadmap to be developed with other Departments;</p><p>- report annually on Official Development Assistance Expenditure on climate;</p><p>- the development and implementation of a methodology for climate proofing all Official Development Assistance;</p><p>- the development of a Department of Foreign Affairs Climate Strategy.</p><p>These important actions require significant technical expertise, to be provided through external support. I have set aside a provision of &euro;150,000 in 2021 for these actions. </p><p>The cost of other actions in the Interim Climate Action Plan are integrated within the operational costs of the Department. This includes:</p><p>- placing climate action, especially for Least Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States, at the heart of or development cooperation and policy partnerships;</p><p>- strengthening climate diplomacy across HQ units and our Embassy network;</p><p>- playing a leadership role on Climate and Security at the UN Security Council.</p></reply>

Earlier this year my Department  published its new Statement of Strategy for the 2021-2023 period which outlines in more detail the key priorities for the next three years and how we will deliver meaningful outcomes for Irish citizens, at home and abroad, and how we will use and grow our influence around the world.</p><p>My Department is working to protect the island of Ireland from the worst effects of Brexit. As the inextricably linked histories of Ireland and Britain enter a new phase, we will foster enhanced links between our States to protect and strengthen our bilateral relations. This is supported by the opening of our new Consulate General of Ireland for the North of England next month. Medium-term strategic exercises with both Scotland and Wales have been launched this year - Ireland Scotland Joint Bilateral Review 2021-25 and Ireland Wales Shared Statement 2021-2025.</p><p>Ireland is a committed member of the European Union and my Department has been continually working with European colleagues to assist each other during this time of crisis, and as we rebuild our economies. This work will continue and deepen throughout the remainder of 2021 and beyond. Earlier this month I launched the <i>Global Ireland: A Strategy for the Nordic Region</i>which provides a framework for deepening our bilateral and multilateral engagement with our like-minded Nordic partners. </p><p>The Government continues to work to strengthen relations and develop alliances with all EU Member States with which we share common goals and interests. This includes the ongoing implementation of our Strategies for France and Germany. The <i>German-Irish Joint Plan of Action</i>, involving a number of Government Departments, was renewed in early 2021 and provides an important avenue for continued cooperation. A similar Joint Plan of Action with France is currently being drafted.</p><p>Recognising the significance of the transatlantic relationship between Ireland and the US, we are strengthening our diplomatic, cultural, and economic relationship with the US at all levels and will continue to act as a bridge in the transatlantic relationship between the EU and US. Work has continued on implementing <i>Ireland's Strategy for the US and Canada 2019-2025</i>across our network of Missions in the US, ensuring a strong, coherent and visible presence for Ireland&rsquo;s economic and cultural footprint. </p><p>Through our membership of the UN and the EU, Ireland actively supports the promotion of democratic values, the rule of law and multilateralism, as key principles underpinning Irish foreign policy. Ireland has continued to promote and uphold these values and principles since taking our seat as an elected member of the UN Security Council for the two year period 2021/22.  Ireland has strongly supported closer cooperation between the UN and the EU, as well as other multilateral organisations, and continues to participate in initiatives of the Alliance for Multilateralism (AfM) grouping. We have also championed respect for international law, including International Human Rights Law and International Humanitarian Law, in our engagement across the agenda of the Council. Ireland has been active in integrating the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda into work across the different country and thematic files. Ireland serves as co-chair of the UN Security Council Informal Expert Group on WPS.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Development Assistance programme is an essential element of our overall foreign policy and national presence overseas, enabling the country to respond to complex human needs and humanitarian crises around the world. The Government is committed to reaching our goal of contributing 0.7% of GNI on overseas development cooperation, and our work to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2020, we have been able to pivot some additional development support to address the impact of COVID19 on the most vulnerable in the world and will, over the rest of 2021, continue this effort to support investment in public health. My Department has also supported calls for action on debt and debt treatment, where necessary, to speed up post-COVID19 recovery and to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>We are providing support for those countries that are poorest and most vulnerable to climate shocks and ensure that climate change is included as a core theme in strategy development where Ireland has a significant development cooperation programme including Small Island Developing States. As a small island nation ourselves, we are leading by example in protecting our oceans and emphasising climate action as a priority in our multilateral engagement. In 2021, my Department&rsquo;s dedicated Climate Unit will develop a Climate Strategy for the DFA and coordinate a Climate Finance Roadmap in consultation with other Government Departments by which to double, at least, the overall percentage of Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Development Assistance that counts as climate finance.</p><p>Delivering first class consular and passport services to our citizens remains an essential priority. My Department was at the forefront of supporting Irish citizens overseas at the outbreak of the pandemic and in the assessment of travel restrictions as a key component of Government to address the impact of COVID. The Passport Office continued to deliver an essential service to citizens throughout the period of restrictions, during which they also contributed to the national contact tracing effort.</p><p>Our global diaspora remain an integral part of the wider Irish family and my Department is continuing to work with them in maintaining and deepening this vital relationship. In November 2020, my Department published a new <i>Diaspora Strategy</i>as part of a series of measures to strengthen our relationship with the diaspora to 2025.</p><p>Continuing to overcome the challenges that the COVID19 pandemic presents to the health and well-being of our citizens remains a priority for Government. My Department has developed strong information flows across Government on global developments which have informed critical decision making. We will continue contribute to economic recovery as we move to the next phase in 2021.</p><p>Our Missions abroad are charged with promoting Ireland, identifying new markets and opportunities for Irish business, and protecting and supporting Irish citizens. We are continuing to implement the <i>Global Ireland Strategy</i>which includes the commitment to double our global footprint by 2025. In 2021, alongside the new Consulate General in the north of England, we are planning to open new Embassies in Morocco, the Philippines and the Ukraine.</p></reply>

The Sub-Committee is a key governance structure for the consideration of gender, equality, diversity and inclusion issues, as outlined in the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts. Five voluntary staff Working Groups &ndash; on Gender, LGBT+, New Irish and Ethnic Diversity, Parents and Carers and Social Inclusion and Disability sit under the Sub Committee. The Sub-Committee, in cooperation with Human Resources Division and other units of my Department, progresses initiatives and run regular events to promote equality and diversity at home and through our Mission network overseas. </p><p>These initiatives include promoting awareness and understanding of the Department, including employment opportunities, to as wide an audience as possible. On 27 May 2021, for example, my Department hosted a public event to mark Africa Day on &lsquo;Recruiting Diverse Talents of African Descent for Public Jobs&rsquo;, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service (PAS) and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Further, the staff led Working Group on Social Inclusion, in partnership with Human Resources Division, are in contact with the North East Inner City Initiative (NEIC)  with a view to the Department&rsquo;s participation in NEIC&rsquo;s Flash Mentoring Programme commencing this Autumn.</p><p>Under broader public outreach activities including <i>Global Ireland 2025</i>'s <i>Global Schools</i>programme, my Department also arranges visits to second-level schools by a diplomat and member of the Defence Forces who has served on peacekeeping duties overseas. The programme involves my Department, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces in a joint collaboration to build awareness about Ireland&rsquo;s place in the world and to generate conversations about global citizenship. The Department pays close attention to ensuring a broad spectrum of schools are visited, including DEIS schools, to ensure broad interest in and awareness of a potential Foreign Service or Defence Forces career. Unfortunately the programme is currently paused during the current pandemic given the pressure all schools are under. However, it is hoped to resume it in the last quarter of the year.</p><p>My Department will continue to expand our outreach efforts to ensure that we reach those groups who continue to be under-represented in our Department including<b></b>persons with disabilities, persons from ethnic minorities, Travellers, Minc&eacute;ir&iacute;.<b></b>The Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Strategy 2019-2022 has a focus on equality, diversity and inclusion as one of its four pillars, underscoring our commitment to the development of this agenda. One area, in particular, that my Human Resources Division is currently prioritising is the issue of recruitment. In late 2020, a staff survey was conducted to ascertain views from staff on building diversity through both external and internal recruitment in the Department. Arising from this feedback, and a review of current practices in place, a new Action Plan on Building Diversity through Recruitment will be presented to the Management Board shortly. </p><p>In respect of persons with disabilities, my Department is fully committed to equality of opportunity in all its employment practices in line with the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024. The Department continually engages with disability services to provide training and awareness courses for staff covering areas as defined under the Disability Act 2005 and ensures that staff members with disabilities are accommodated in our workplace by utilising our trained Disability Liaison Officer. The Department also conducted an Access and Sensory Audit of the Passport Service in 2020.  Further, my Department is a supporter of the Willing, Able and Mentoring (WAM) programme and has supported 11 placements to graduates with disabilities since the programme commenced in 2006. My Department&rsquo;s contribution was acknowledged by the Association of Higher Education and Disabilities (AHEAD) and a plaque awarded to DFA under the WAM Leader Awards in 2019 and 2020.</p><p>There are no Agencies under the remit of my Department.</p></reply>

These unacceptable forms of behaviour are not tolerated in the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  The Military Authorities have advised me that there are robust measures and systems currently in place within the Defence Forces to address any allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.  Defence Force Regulation A7, in the first instance, provides the regulatory framework for dealing with such matters for serving members of the Defence Forces in both a formal and informal way through a trained Designated Contact Person (DCP) network. </p>  <p>   Within this framework, Administrative Instruction A7, Chapter 1 sets out the Defence Forces policy and procedures regarding interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces including sexual harassment, harassment and bullying, in order to deter unacceptable behaviour and promote a service environment based on mutual respect, equality and professionalism.</p>  <p>   Where the alleged victim and the alleged suspect of inappropriate behaviour of a possible criminal nature, are both serving members, a complaint may be made directly to the Military Police. Depending on the nature of the case, such complaints may be referred to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Cases involving a civilian, whether a former member of the Defence Forces or not, are matters appropriate for investigation by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I urge those who may have suffered serious wrong of a criminal nature to report their concerns to an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have the lawful authority, skills and resources to investigate and to prosecute such matters and to treat all of those in this process with dignity and respect, especially those who come forward with traumatic detail. </p>  <p>  The need to care for the well-being of its members is a priority for the Defence Forces and in this regard, the Personnel Support Service (PSS) is in place for the use of members and their immediate family, The Brigade PSS Office and Occupational Social Worker network in each Brigade/Formation supports Defence Forces personnel and their families in times of crisis and general difficulty. Services include the provision of information and advice on areas including stress management, counselling and referral options.</p></reply>

On the 15th December 2020, the Government approved terms of reference and the membership of an independent Commission on the Defence Forces.  This Commission subsequently commenced their work and will continue to work throughout 2021 with their report due in December 2021. The work of the Commission will inform the future development of the Defence Forces.</p><p>The Defence Organisation has played a sigificant role in the State's overall response to the Covid 19 pandemic.  The response has involved the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and Civil Defence, having regard to their specific roles.  The Defence Organisation has participated in a number of official groups such as the High Level Task Force for Covid 19 Vaccination.  In addition to supporting the HSE, the Defence Forces have also provided a broad range of supports to other Departments and Agencies.Provision of this support will continue to remain one of my Department's main priorities for 2021. </p><p>Implementation of projects arising from the White Paper on Defence (2015) has continued.  In total, of the initial 95 projects, 47 are now formally completed.  An additional 5 new projects will be initiated during 2021.  I have  also approved the commencement of a further 15 projects in the period 2022 to 2025.  The three year implementation plan for &quot;Civil Defence - Towards 2030&quot; has been approved and is being implemented and other Public Sector Initiatives have been progressed.</p><p>My Department has progressed a number of activities including recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces, and related HR issues.  Central to this was the continued implementation of the High Level Implementation Plan &ldquo;Strengthening Our Defence Forces&rdquo;.  A range of other recruitment initiatives have been introduced including commissioning from the ranks, the re-entry of former PDF personnel with specific skills and a sea-going service commitment scheme for members of the Naval Service.In addition, a range of direct entry specialist competitions have also been initiated as a further means to fill critical positions.  </p><p>An organisational capability review of the Department of Defence commenced in 2021.  The Review is being conducted by the Organisational Capability Review team which is based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will involve engagement with Departmental staff and key stakeholders in the policy and operational domains of the Department.  </p><p>The Department of Defence and Defence Forces Strategy Statement 2021-2023 was published in April 2021 and comes at a pivotal time for the Defence Organisation with the establishment of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the Organisational Capability Review of the Department of Defence.  This Strategy Statement will be subject to a mid-term review.  </p><p>In relation to international initiatives, my Department's main focus since June 2020 has been Ireland's policy input regarding the establishment of the European Peace Facility (EPF) which is a new mechanism to finance Common Security and Defence Policy activities.  The Council decision establishing the EPF was adopted in March 2021.  In addition, my Department continues to provide initial policy input into the process around the EU's Strategic Compass which was proposed to enhance and guide the implementation of the Level of Ambition arising out of the EU's Global Strategy.  These two EU initiatives will require further policy input by my Department in 2021. </p><p>Since June 2020 with the successful outcome for Ireland in achieving a UN Security Council seat, additional structures have been established between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence and the Defence Forces with a view to greater coordination on peacekeeping policy issues.  This will continue to be a priority for my Department and the Defence Forces throughout 2021.</p><p>The 10<sup>th</sup>Be Winter Ready public safety campaign was launched in November 2020. My Department has also overseen the launch of a new Be Summer Ready public safety campaign.  Under the chairmanship of my Department, the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning adopted the SEM Guideline 4 - Climate Change Adaption document. <b></b>My Department also published The National Risk Assessment for Ireland 2020.  The National Risk Assessment identifies and assesses the likelihood and impact of key risks facing the State across a broad range of emergencies.  It will also form part of the EU-wide risk assessment process. </p><p>My Department will continue to implement the rolling 5 year Infrastructure Plan and rolling 5 year Equipment Development Plan for the Defence Forces.A step change in military air-based capability is being achieved through the delivery into service of the Pilatus PC-12 aircraft.  The original order of three aircraft, which were delivered in September 2020, was augmented on an urgent basis by an additional aircraft delivered in April 2020 to enhance fixed wing capacity to meet demands arising from Covid-19.Other major equipment projects are also being progressed and delivered. Climate action has been integrated into equipment &amp;amp; infrastructure programmes of work and this will continue in 2021.  </p><p>In relation to legislation, the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2020 and the Defence Forces (Evidence) Bill 2019 were restored to the D&aacute;il Order Paper.  The Second Stage and Committee Stage debates on the Defence (Amendment) Bill were subsequently completed during 2020.  My Department received approval from Government to introduce Report Stage amendments to the Defence (Amendment) Bill to provide for the possible deployment of members of the Reserve Defence Force on voluntary military service (both within the State and overseas).  These are enabling provisions to give effect to commitments in the Programme for Government subject to the recommendations by the Commission on the Defence Forces.  The necessary amendments are currently been finalised. </p><p>I am satisfied that significant progress is being made in implementing the Government&rsquo;s ambitious programme for Defence and I look forward to ongoing delivery of key commitments.</p></reply>

This decision was taken by government to ensure for every candidate in 2021, a method to assess their learning and attainment at the end of their post-primary education, and to progress to higher and further education, and the world of work.</p>  <p>  Leaving Certificate results for 2021 are expected to issue directly to candidates through the Candidate Self Service Portal on Friday 3 September.</p>  <p>  The written examinations began on 9 June and will run until 17 June in the case of Leaving Certificate Applied and 29 June in the case of Leaving Certificate (established).</p>  <p>  Candidates have been provided with the choice of sitting the examinations, opting to receive Accredited Grades or both on a subject by subject basis. This dual process, believed to be unique in the world, was put in place following consultation with stakeholders in response to the disrupted learning experienced by the class of 2021 during the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021. </p>  <p>  In any subject where a candidate sits the examination and opts to receive an Accredited Grade, they will be credited with the better of the two results.</p>  <p>  Putting in place both the examinations and a corresponding measure of SEC-Accredited Grades recognises the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and the loss of learning that has occurred for this group of students due to the interruption of in-person teaching and learning during the periods of school closures.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the huge effort and collaboration by teachers, school leaders and of course students, in relation to the examinations and Accredited Grades process over the last number of months, the timeframes for finalisation of results are particularly challenging this year. This is in part due to the fact that the SEC has to manage both the examinations and Accredited Grades processes in parallel.</p>  <p>  The results issue date this year, 3 September, must take account of both the examinations marking process and the Accredited Grades process operating in parallel and being brought together at the end to issue to candidates.  To ensure the accuracy and the integrity of the results being provided to candidates, sufficient time must be allowed not only in the parallel operation of both of these complex processes but also in the integration of the results to ensure that candidates are provided with a set of examinations results that comprises, based on their individual options on a subject by subject basis, examination results, Accredited Grades or the better of the two. </p>  <p>  A range of checking and robust quality assurance procedures apply to the resulting and grading processes for the examination results and Accredited Grades focussed on maintaining data integrity and on identifying and reconciling candidate information.  Given the robust quality assurance checks associated with the resulting process and in the integration of both the Accredited Grades and written examinations, It is of vital importance that the processes are given sufficient time to execute to the highest standards.  </p>  <p>  Candidates&rsquo; results will be transferred to the CAO at the earliest opportunity to facilitate the generation of offers to CAO applicants.  The CAO have announced that Round 1 offers will be made on 7 September. </p>  <p>  For those Leaving Certificate candidates who have applied to pursue their higher education in UK Universities, the UCAS deadline for acceptance of conditional offers is 8 September 2021. </p>  <p>  In 2020, along with the UK, countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland and Hungary showed flexibility in working with the Department to accommodate Irish students, when results issued on 7 September 2020. </p>  <p>  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has already been engaged with these countries, as has my own Department, and both Departments will continue their work to ensure that the same flexibility will be extended to the 2021 Leaving Certificate candidates. </p>  <p>  It is important that candidates who have applied for places in universities and colleges outside of Ireland should engage with the institutions to which they have applied as early as possible to notify them of the results date and to confirm their position.</p></reply>

Its clear vision is focussed on realising the potential of digital technologies to enable our young people to become engaged thinkers, active learners, knowledge constructors and global citizens to participate fully in society and the economy. In developing this Strategy, the Department adopted an evidence-based approach including extensive research and consultation with education stakeholders including young people. A key support of the strategy is the Digital Learning Framework for teachers and school leaders, which was trialled in 50 schools during the 2017/2018 school year before being evaluated and improved and rolled out to all schools in September 2019. The Department has engaged the Educational Research Centre to undertake a three-year longitudinal study of the impact and efficacy of the Digital Learning Framework, and this study is expected to be completed in 2022. All schools are supported to develop a Digital Learning Plan, and have flexibility to determine how best to embed the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning in their school to enhance teaching and learning, taking into account their individual circumstances and contexts. The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE), a Department funded support service, offers advice and supports to schools on digital learning. Advice sheets are available on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of laptops and tablets in schools. Digital learning in schools is also assessed by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate.</p><p>My Department is aware of the report referred to by the Deputy. However, decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools are a matter for the Board of Management of each school. Schools are advised to consult with members of the school community including parents when planning for the introduction of digital technologies, including devices. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements. </p><p>While this spirit of partnership is in place in schools the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill will provide a mechanism for enhanced consultation on such matters in schools. This legislation provides a clear framework that schools will have to apply in their engagement with students and parents. One of the key concepts of the Bill is the need for a school to consult with students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities. The Bill completed all stages of the Seanad in late 2019. The Department of Education is currently awaiting an order for Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>As the current Digital Strategy for Schools expires at the end of the current school year (2020/2021), development of a new Digital Strategy is underway. An extensive consultation process has commenced with details available at . All relevant research and reports will be reviewed as part of the process to develop the new strategy.</p></reply>

Digital learning in schools is also assessed by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate. </p><p>Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools are a matter for the Board of Management of each school. Schools are advised to consult with members of the school community including parents when planning for the introduction of digital technologies including devices. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements. </p><p>While this spirit of partnership is in place in schools the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill will provide a mechanism for enhanced consultation on such matters in schools. This legislation provides a clear framework that schools will have to apply in their engagement with students and parents. One of the key concepts of the Bill is the need for a school to consult with students and their parents on individual school plans, policies and activities. The Bill completed all stages of the Seanad in late 2019. The Department of Education is currently awaiting an order for Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>There is a range of educational software, apps and tools including devices available and schools have discretion in determining which to use depending on their own circumstances and requirements. Extensive support and guidance on the use of many of the most commonly used is provided by PDST-TiE. The provision of a uniform or centralised approach would require an extensive feasibility, scoping and procurement exercise to be undertaken, with ongoing support and maintenance required to enable implementation. Many schools will have determined which software, apps and tools including devices best meet their own needs in accordance with their circumstances and digital learning plan, and will have invested accordingly. </p><p>As the current Digital Strategy for Schools expires at the end of the current school year (2020/2021), development of a new Digital Strategy is underway. An extensive consultation process has commenced with details available at  . All relevant research and reports will be reviewed as part of the process to develop the new strategy.</p></reply>

This included &euro;50m in respect of the 2020-2021 school year brought forward and issued in December 2020. Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions. The funding is intended to enable schools to implement their Digital Learning Plan through provision of appropriate infrastructure. This includes Desktop PCs, laptops, tablets or hybrid devices, projectors/flat screens, cloud-based tools and software applications, and learning platforms.  </p>  <p>  Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools is a matter for the Board of Management of each school, as schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to adopt in terms of supporting the learning needs of their students based on school's own context and circumstances, and in accordance with their Digital Learning Plan. </p>  <p>  Schools are advised to consult with members of the school community including parents when planning for the introduction of digital technologies including devices. The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements.  </p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice and supports to schools on digital learning. Advice sheets are available on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of laptops and tablets in schools. </p>  <p>  The Department spends just over &euro;150 million annually to provide a suite of supports to schools in the DEIS programme, of which &euro;16.2 million, in the form of a DEIS grant was allocated to schools ahead of schedule for the 2020/21 school year. This is an annual grant to support learning in the context of DEIS for the academic year. In recognition of the difficulties faced by some students to engage with remote learning, at the time the grant issued last year all DEIS schools were informed by letter that they could consider using some of their DEIS funding to support pupils&rsquo; learning, for example to arrange access to additional materials of supports for students during the move to remote teaching and learning caused by Covid-19. It is a matter for each individual school to determine how best to use this funding, but it is intended to support the objectives of the DEIS programme. </p>  <p>  Schools are asked to be conscious of students who may not have access to online facilities or technology and to adapt approaches to ensure that these pupils&rsquo; ability to participate in learning is not compromised. Many schools have already introduced a range of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of these pupils are catered for, including pupils who have limited access to technology or whose parents are not in a position to support their learning. The guidance sets out approaches that schools can take and my Department will be asking schools to ensure that there is a specific focus on ensuring that these pupils are supported. Schools in the DEIS programme are asked to use all available supports, both in-school and community-based, to promote a positive solution-oriented approach that will support all pupils to achieve, to learn and to progress in their education and to help minimise any further educational inequality among those at risk of educational disadvantage.   </p>  <p>  The development of a new Digital Strategy is underway and an extensive consultation process has commenced with an open call for submissions. Further strands of the consultation will include questionnaires to key stakeholder and engagement through focus groups. A Consultative Advisory Group has been established comprising key stakeholders representing parents, teachers, students and industry. Future funding measures to support schools in embedding the use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment will be considered as part of that process.</p></reply>

On  27 July 2020  I published &lsquo;Reopening Our Schools: The Roadmap for The Full Return to School&rsquo;, supported by a funding package of &euro;375 million with this funding being supplemented over the course of the academic year.  The safe return to schools in September 2020 involved approximately 1 million students and 100,000 staff in 4,000 schools. This was supported by special arrangements for PPE, school transport, classroom layouts, curriculum guidance and additional staffing. In recognition of the fact that remote learning was particularly challenging for children with additional needs, a supplementary programme was put in place to support the education and/or care needs of pupils with complex needs.</p>  <p>  Following a further period of school closure in early 2021, schools reopened on a phased basis in February/March, with a full reopening after the Easter break. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Leaving Certificate, the provision of Calculated Grades for over 60,000 Leaving Certificate students in 2020 enabled them to progress to further and higher education and the world of work. For the 2021 Leaving Cert, following an intensive set of engagements with stakeholders, arrangements in respect of the 2021 state exams were decided on by Government on 17 February, with both written examinations and accredited grades available to students. The written Leaving Certificate written exams successfully commenced on 9 June with the orals in language subjects and the practical components in other subjects having taken place earlier including during the traditional Easter Holidays. The choice provided to students as between accredited grades or examinations or a combination of both is a student centred approach which I was anxious to deliver on.</p>  <p>   Other significant achievements in the period referred to by the Deputy include:</p>  <p>  - Significant increased investment in education secured in Budget 2021. Budget 2021 continued the programme of major reinvestment in our primary and post-primary education system. Building on the initiatives set out in the Programme for Government, the budget for the Department of Education will be &euro;8.9 billion in 2021, an increase of &euro;410 million or some 5 five per cent on 2020 and creating 1,065 new teaching posts. This investment will see the primary staffing schedule reduced by one point, to a historically low level of 25:1.</p>  <p>  - Expanded summer provision for pupils with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage was delivered in Summer 2020 and, for 2021, I secured a doubling of the funding available to &euro;40m so that the programmes could be further expanded.</p>  <p>  - Development of a New Digital Strategy for Schools</p>  <p>  - The launch of a new arts in education initiative &ndash; BLAST 2021</p>  <p>  - Payment of &euro;100 million in ICT grant funding for schools, inclusive of a special &euro;10 million payment to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students during the school closures period.</p>  <p>  - Payment of &euro;50 million under the Minor Works Scheme to primary and post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  - A 6 week sampler module of languages in primary schools has been announced, with schools invited to express an interest in participating with funding to support the participation of at least 100 schools provided.  It will include foreign languages and Irish Sign Language (ISL) and will run for 6 weeks towards the end of the first term of the 2021/22 school year.  The module will be used to inform the development of a new primary curriculum for foreign languages over the coming years.</p>  <p>  - Budget 2021 investment includes a capital allocation for new and more energy-efficient school buildings with a &euro;740 million budget for 2021 under Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  - &euro;160 million was provided to schools in Minor Works funding in 2020, including &euro;30 million which was brought forward from 2021. Due to the unprecedented Covid-19 situation, exceptional Minor Works Grant funding was also provided to Post Primary schools.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 999,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.</p>  <p>  Extending the free travel scheme to people with epilepsy during the period in which they are disallowed from driving cannot be considered in isolation.  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This support is available to all workers impacted by the pandemic, including those in the aviation sector, and is not provided on a sectoral basis. </p>  <p>  I have recently confirmed as part of the National Economic Recovery Plan that PUP is being extended beyond the end of June 2021.  This extension is not sector-specific.  To allow as much time as possible for employment to recover, a transitional approach will be taken with payments reduced on a tapered basis over 6 months from next September.

Any proposal to resolve this specific issue, can and will only apply to CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors. </p>  <p>  Within this context, officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform held discussions on proposals to progress and resolve this issue over the past number of months, while having regard to the wider budgetary framework.  Officials from my Department also held discussions with unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, an agreement was reached between my colleagues, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on proposals to resolve the long-standing issue. Details of these proposals have been forwarded to the unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors by my Department officials.  I understand the unions have been considering these proposals and have sought clarification on some of the details contained therein.  My Department officials are continuing to engage with the unions on this basis.</p>  <p>  I am confident this is a solid basis for progressing and resolving this complex issue, while ensuring there is no potential exposure for additional costs to the exchequer. </p>  <p>  Minister Humphreys and I will continue to support CE for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities.</p></reply>

This migration of the Department&rsquo;s banking services to the new provider, Danske Bank, was completed last month.  </p>  <p>  One of the last banking migration phases was the moving of foreign EFT payments, which was carried out in March 2021.  These payments are to beneficiaries who are resident in 21 countries outside of both the Single European Payments Area (SEPA) and the United Kingdom.  While the migration of these foreign payments to Danske Bank was successful, beneficiaries in the United States and Canada were levied with cross border payment charges by their own banks.</p>  <p>  While the Department of Social Protection has no control over the fees charged by foreign banks to their own customers, the Department has been in continuous liaison with Danske Bank to try and reduce or eliminate the fees which U.S. and Canadian banks might charge their own customers.  The Department has also implemented a number of payment process changes to Social Welfare pension payments to help in this regard.</p>  <p>  EFT payments to markets outside Ireland where the sending bank is not a member of the domestic clearing system, such as the US or Canada, are processed as international cross border payments, also known as &lsquo;international wire transfers&rsquo;.  Processing such payments as international wire transfers ensures that the sending bank complies with its national and international Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) obligations.  In order to effect these international wire transfers in markets such as the US and Canada, the services of correspondent banks are necessary, and their use is the industry standard approach.  Correspondent banks will deduct charges from the payment amount to compensate for the cost of processing the payment and discharging their AML and CTF obligations. </p>  <p>  As previously outlined in Parliamentary Question No. 423 of 5 May 2021, Danske Bank secured a significant reduction in the processing charge levied by its American correspondent bank on the Department&rsquo;s payments to pensioners resident in the United States.  In addition, the Department amended its Social Welfare payment files to ensure that all pension payments to beneficiaries outside the SEPA zone and the UK are clearly marked as pension payments.  This change was in place for all payments to North America in April.  </p>  <p>  Many bank customers in both Canada and the United States can avail of reduced bank fees on pension payments, depending on the financial institution that they bank with and the type of account they hold.  The Department is aware of a number of pensioners in both the United States and Canada who no longer incur any charges due to these payment processing changes, in particular the explicit marking of the Department&rsquo;s payments as pension payments.</p>  <p>  For pension payments to Canada, the Department of Social Protection has implemented a number of changes to its payment file processing to enable Danske Bank to direct payments to additional correspondent banks.  These changes have ensured that payments to most pensioners in Canada should only incur one set of cross border fees.  With these process changes the number of correspondent banks that can handle Social Welfare payments has changed from one in March, to four in April and six in June.</p>  <p>  Further changes are currently being implemented which should eliminate duplicate cross border fees for the remaining pensioners who do not have an account in one of these six Canadian correspondent banks.  It is hoped that this change will be in place for pension payments issued in July 2021.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection continues to liaise with Danske Bank in relation to this issue.</p></reply>

Throughout this time, thanks to the monumental efforts of the staff of my Department, we have continued to provide vital income supports, through the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the enhanced Illness Benefit scheme - alongside all of the existing suite of social protection schemes for our pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, one-parent families amongst others &ndash; to all of our citizens.   Research undertaken by the ESRI on the impact on family incomes of Covid-19 related job losses found that 400,000 families would have seen their disposable income fall by more than 20 per cent in the absence of policy measures such as the PUP and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). The ESRI also found that the PUP and TWSS measures were particularly effective in cushioning families at the lower-end of income distribution from losses. </p>  <p>  As a further step towards supporting those in greatest need, we provided for a the payment of a Christmas Bonus to over 1.6 million recipients in December with payments totalling &euro;390 million.  On an exceptional basis, the 2020 Christmas Bonus was also paid to some 311,000 recipients of the PUP who had also been in receipt of a PUP payment - continuously or otherwise - for at least 4 months (17 weeks) since March 2020, at an additional cost of over &euro;93 million.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the enormous strain on the national finances caused by the pandemic, I was pleased to be able to secure funding in Budget 2021 for a number of targeted increases aimed at particularly vulnerable cohorts of the population. These included increases to the living alone allowance, fuel allowance, qualified child increases, an increase in the offshore island allowance, an increase to the disability allowance earnings threshold, a &euro;150 increase in the carers support grant  and the removal of the one parent family payment earnings threshold.</p>  <p>  I was also pleased to secure funding of an additional &euro;5.5 million to provide for a major expansion of the Hot School Meals Pilot Programme.  This will extend the provision of hot school meals to an additional 35,000 primary school children, currently receiving the cold lunch option. </p>  <p>  As part of the wider Government Covid-19 emergency response, we introduced a simplified application for rent supplement.  I was particularly pleased that we were able to establish a protocol with Tusla which ensures that victims of domestic violence are now able to access rent supplement as seamlessly and as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  I was equally glad to be in a position to provide additional supports to families by ensuring that the Department was in a position to pay for the additional three weeks of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit when the necessary legislation was introduced earlier this year.</p>  <p>  In fulfilment of a commitment under the Programme for Government, I was glad to be able to introduce a benefit payment for people aged between 65 and 66 years who are no longer engaged in employment or self-employment. A person in receipt of this payment is not required to be available for full-time work or to be genuinely seeking work and they are not be required to sign on the Live Register.</p>  <p>  Again in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment, I established the Pensions Commission which is  examining sustainability and eligibility issues in respect of State Pension arrangements and which will outline options for the Government to address issues such as qualifying age, contribution rates, total contributions and eligibility requirements.</p>  <p>  Also in the pensions area, I was very pleased to be able to formally sign regulations to introduce the IORP II directive, a very substantial directive which supports positive reform of the Irish occupational pension sector.</p>  <p>  As part of the July Jobs Stimulus Package, the Government announced 3,000 additional places on Employment Support Schemes, including Community Employment and T&uacute;s.  These additional places will provide valuable opportunities for long term unemployed persons and will support CE and T&uacute;s schemes in providing services to local communities in rural and urban communities.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising a new Pathways to Work Strategy which I expect to publish in the coming weeks and which will focus on the next stage of our response to the pandemic and on supporting people to get back to work.</p>  <p>  These are some of the key achievements which my Department, through the enormous efforts of all of its staff, was able to deliver over the past year.</p></reply>

I am keenly aware of the role of employment in developing personal capabilities and potential, deepening social connections and enabling full participation and inclusion in society.  My Department is committed to assisting all individuals in society to prepare for and secure employment. I also understand that the path to employment is not the same for everyone and that additional help is required for those facing disadvantage and those in minority communities.</p>  <p>  The key avenue for my Department to enable access to employment for all unemployed persons is through the Public Employment Service, Intreo. The Intreo service is available to all and supports jobseekers with employment assistance and advice to progress persons into employment, including addressing skills deficits. This engagement, along with the suite of labour market activation policies, is designed to assist jobseekers to prepare for, secure and sustain employment.</p>  <p>  Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our society and economy, Government is taking steps to enhance the capacity of the Public Employment Service and the supports available to the unemployed. This will be delivered through the forthcoming Pathways to Work 2021-2025 strategy. Key insights to this strategy, which I hope to launch in the coming weeks, were included in the Economic Recovery Plan published earlier this month.  </p>  <p>  While this Pathways to Work strategy will include measures to address the challenges arising as a result of the pandemic, the strategy will also focus on those groups unemployed and most distant from the labour market pre-pandemic. The Economic Recovery Plan introduced some of the key measures which will focus assistance on disadvantaged groups, including:</p>  <p>  - Expanding the delivery of employment services to Lone Parents;</p>  <p>  - Introducing an Early Engagement model for jobseekers with disabilities, </p>  <p>  - Promoting wider take-up of incentives and supports available for the employment of people with disabilities;</p>  <p>  - Reserving places on employment services and training programmes for people from minority backgrounds of disadvantage; </p>  <p>  - Consulting with stakeholders from the Traveller (and/or Roma) community to advise the PES in developing tailored support programmes.</p>  <p>  This work, under both Pathways to Work and the Economic Recovery Plan, seeks to not only return our economy and society to the pre-pandemic position, but to foster a more balanced, sustainable and inclusive recovery. This includes building a more inclusive labour market, with a greater focus on participation and reducing barriers to participation and/or employment.</p>  <p>  In addition to those supports provided by Intreo, my Department works closely with the Further Education and Training sector in the provision of activation supports, including opportunities for training, upskilling and reskilling. The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025, launched by my Colleague Minister Harris earlier this year, includes a bursary support scheme to be established for participants from disadvantaged groups, including lone parents, people with disabilities, Travellers and Roma. The strategy also commits to an equity of access stakeholder subcommittee to ensure that programme designs reflect the needs of underrepresented groups.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The legislation requires that persons must claim their entitlements within a specific period from the date their entitlement arises.  This is referred to as the 'prescribed time'.  The prescribed time for making a claim differs depending on the relevant scheme and once a claim is made within the prescribed time for that particular payment, it is automatically backdated to the date of entitlement. </p><p>Where a claim is made after the prescribed time, a statutory disqualification or disallowance is incurred for any period falling outside the relevant time limits.  However, the legislation gives deciding officers and designated persons some discretion to<i></i>consider backdating a claim entitlement date subject to prescribed limits.  Regulations allow for circumstances where the claimant establishes to the satisfaction of a deciding officer or designated person that there was &lsquo;good cause&rsquo; for any delay in making a claim, that they were inadvertently misinformed by an officer of the Department or incapacitated and unable to make the claim on time.</p><p>Each late claim is assessed by deciding officers on a case by case basis taking into account the contentions and evidence put forward by the applicant to explain the cause of the delay.  The deciding officer may decide to backdate the payment, for a maximum period of up to 6 months in respect of most schemes, depending on the circumstances.  Backdating of a late claim beyond 6 months can be considered only in<i></i>two<i></i>specific circumstances whereby the failure to claim arose as the result of either incorrect information being supplied by the Department or the claimant&rsquo;s incapacity due to illness or infirmity.</p><p>The existing legislation allows a Deciding Officer the discretion to back date payment where he/she is satisfied that the claimant had &lsquo;good cause&rsquo; for failing to apply within the prescribed time, provided of course that the claimant was eligible during the 6 months. </p><p>'Good cause' is not defined in the legislation, and is assessed by deciding officers by the application of common sense principles to the contentions put forward by the person concerned and by the evaluation of the evidence available to support those contentions. </p><p>Lack of knowledge is not regarded as a sufficient reason for not claiming in time.  The Department publishes information regarding its schemes, including the time limits for making a claim, as widely as possible in a range of formats, and advertises changes of legislation in the National Press.  Information Offices are also available throughout the country for people to make enquiries as to their entitlements.</p><p>All statutory decisions with regard to entitlement under these provisions, made by deciding officers and designated persons, can be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. </p><p>The Department has published information and operational guidelines on Claims and Late Claims on gov.ie.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

DCEDIY ensured that all Comhairle na n&Oacute;g members, over 16 years of age, were actively encouraged to take part in this National Dialogue on Climate Action (NDCA).

DCEDIY ensured the inclusion of young people by facilitating consultations with the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g National Executive on the design of the online survey to make it accessible for young people. The online portal is based on 5 key climate relevant pillars, with questions to capture current thinking, an online quiz to capture people's willingness to change behaviour and supporting content to engage citizens on proposed future approaches. All Comhairle na n&Oacute;g across the country were invited and encouraged to participate in this on-line process; information was also issued to the recipient organisations of the DCEDIY Youth Climate Justice Fund encouraging their participation in this on-line element.</p><p><b>Local level conversations via Comhairle na n&Oacute;g networks:</b>Young people were asked to contribute via the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g network with their observations and suggestions for local action. Following a selection process, 12 Comhairle na n&Oacute;g hosted in-depth locally focused conversations. The design of these local level climate conversations was developed with the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g National Executive. The Youth Climate Conversations at local level provided an opportunity for members of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g to meet up online for a structured conversation about their hopes and concerns, ideas for climate action in their local area, and how to support deeper youth engagement in climate issues. Their feedback will be integrated into the summary &lsquo;climate conversations&rsquo; report.</p><p><b>In depth Citizen Conversations (80-90 citizens): </b>A two week online community for participants was set up to host a series of focus groups on different topics. As part of this online citizen community, there was a youth strand of 20 young citizens.

The Strategy includes a range of actions to support employment and pathways to work for migrants. The Strategy has been extended until the end of 2021 to reflect the impact of COVID-19 on implementation.</p><p>Under the 2016 European Social Fund (&ldquo;ESF&rdquo;) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (&ldquo;PEIL&rdquo;) Integration and Employment of Migrants (&ldquo;IEM&rdquo;) programme. Five projects were approved for funding of &euro;3.3m over 4 years. These projects are completing in 2021. This programme is funded 50% by EU, and 50% by the Government of Ireland.</p><p>There is currently a Call for Proposals open for projects to provide employment supports for persons within the International Protection System, in the amount of &euro;250,000. </p><p><i>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme</i>(IRPP) operates a Programme of resettlement across different counties throughout the country.  Integral to the Programme is the employment of both Resettlement Workers (RSWs) and Inter-cultural workers (ICWs) who assist the refugees in their transition to independent community living.</p><p>The ICWs in particular encourage all refugees to partake in education with a specific focus on English language training.  In addition, they seek to identify any skills, trades or past educational experience that refugees may possess with a view to matching them with potential employers or indeed further training or educational providers. </p><p>Others refugees with pre-existing trade skills have completed trade-focussed upskilling to allow them seek work in Ireland, for example Safepass and Forklift training.  Others are facilitated in accessing Community Employment Schemes, again with a view to building on existing skill-sets in the hope of accessing full-time employment at a later stage.</p><p>Beyond that, in other instances RSWs have leveraged local contacts on the ground to provide people with the opportunity to obtain part-time work, again with a view to building up skill-sets and experience with the ultimate goal being to access full-time employment into the future.</p><p><i>The Anti-Racism Committee</i>are in the middle of their Public Consultation (21 April to 14 July 2021) towards developing a National Action Plan Against Racism. Access to employment is one of the key themes of the Consultation.</p><p><b></b><i>The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy</i>(NTRIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 represents a whole of Government approach to bring about meaningful change and progress for the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland. The Strategy includes a range of actions to support employment and pathways to work for Travellers and Roma</p><p>My Department provides funding to the Special Initiative for Travellers (SITS) which is an initiative focussing on 7 locations nationwide with a view to coaching and assisting Travellers wishing to enter employment. </p><p>In relation to persons with disabilities, my Department is responsible for co-ordinating the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024 (CES). The CES is the primary disability employment policy initiative in Ireland. It is a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to employment of persons with disabilities. The CES&rsquo;s strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide coordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers.</p><p>The public sector provides crucial opportunities for people with disabilities to access employment.  The Government has committed to doubling the target for employment of people with disabilities in the public service from 3% to 6%.  This is a commitment contained in the CES. This will be done by means of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill.  The General Scheme of that Bill will come to Government for approval this month.</p><p>Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 sets out the legal obligations of public service bodies:-</p><p>- To promote and support the employment of people with disabilities</p><p>- To meet a target of 3% of employees with disabilities</p><p>- To report every year on achievement of these obligations</p><p>The National Disability Authority (NDA) has a statutory role in monitoring employment of persons with disabilities in the public sector.  In their latest Report &ldquo;2018 Report on Compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act on the Employment of People with Disabilities in the Public Sector&rdquo; the NDA reported that the then Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the agencies under the remit of the Department had all exceeded the 3% employment target for people with disabilities.</p><p>The Disability Liaison Officer of my Department works closely with the Public Appointments Service, who recruit for general civil grades for my Department and with staff who identify the need for an accommodation to ensure that they are supported in entering and remaining in the workplace.</p><p>My Department also participates in the Willing, Able and Mentoring Programme which is run by AHEAD and provides 6 month placements for graduates with disabilities.</p><p>My Department is willing to participate in any civil service scheme to enable access to employment for persons from minority and or disadvantaged communities.</p></reply>

Legislation is being progressed which will restrict the up-front payments required to secure accommodation, including student accommodation, to no more than the equivalent of two months&rsquo; rent, and limit payments thereafter to on month&rsquo;s rent at a time. Affordability of student accommodation will be discussed with stakeholders in the sector at the next meeting of the Working Group on Student Accommodation.

Institutions and providers will continue to put in place plans to ensure that the overall number of people on campus at a given time continues to be moderated.</p><p>Under the Plan, larger scale lectures will take place on-site if the public health situation continues to improve as expected but some moderation in numbers may still be required. The safety measures which will be in place such as social distancing, face masks and indoor ventilation will be in accordance with prevailing public health advice taking into account the essential nature of further and higher education and research.</p><p>In addition, contingency planning based on a more restrictive public health environment is also being prepared by the sector. Even in a more restrictive public health environment, it is envisaged that there would still be significant on-site activities.</p><p>The Plan will operate along with and be supported by:</p><p>- The COVID-19 Adaptation Framework for further and higher education</p><p>- The Practical Guidance for Further and Higher Education (to be updated in line with prevailing public health advice).</p><p>- Sectoral guidance (to be updated in line with prevailing public health advice)</p><p>- The Sectoral Pact as outlined in Section 5 of the plan</p><p>- The Work Safety Protocol published by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</p><p>- The Government Plan - COVID &ndash; 19 Resilience and Recovery: The Path Ahead</p><p>In the interim period leading to the return in autumn 2021, sectoral planning will be reviewed monthly with an update on planning to be provided to Government in July.

This is in addition to additional places commencing in 2021, funded through the Human Capital Initiative Pillar 2, which will be on undergraduate courses in areas of identified skills needs.</p>  <p>  The CAO process applications for undergraduate courses on behalf of the Higher Education Institutions.  Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. As such, neither I nor my Department have a role in the operation of the CAO.</p>  <p>  However, my Department is monitoring the situation as it develops and my officials are working with the HEA and the Higher Education Institutions to identify where there is scope for additional places to be provided. In addition to higher education, I would like to highlight the range of options available in further education and training and apprenticeships. These options can serve both as an alternate pathway to a chosen career or an alternate pathway into higher education. For students who are not successful in gaining an offer for their course of choice in the first instance, there are alternate routes available to them to reach their preferred option.</p>  <p>  All bodies involved will continue to work to ensure the availability of a full range of further and higher education options for applicants in 2021 and in future years.</p></reply>

This Working Group is comprised of the sectoral representatives of students, staff and providers alongside representatives of relevant Government Departments such as the Department of Justice, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Social Protection.  </p>  <p>  This Working Group is planning for a limited, safe return of on-site activity, which comprises small group in-person learning to cater exclusively for needs of the existing cohort of ELE students currently in the State. This approach for on-site activity is consistent with small group learning across further, higher and adult education.  To enable this to happen, all existing restrictions and public health guidance with appropriate protective measures and limited congregation will be followed supported by reopening protocols and an adaptation framework that are aligned with public health guidelines to facilitate and ensure the safe return to classroom activity for this cohort of students. The Working Group has worked collaboratively to develop these sectoral reopening protocols and supporting materials and this work is now nearing finalisation.   </p>  <p>  This approach notes the sector is much reduced with estimates placing student numbers at less than 10,000 currently in the State in comparison to pre-pandemic levels where the sector has capacity to facilitate approximately 200,000 foreign learners annually. </p>  <p>  Prospective ELE learners in the State not previously enrolled and students who are not currently in the country are not included in these planned on site activities.</p>  <p>  ELE providers have been advised that there remains no basis for the recruitment of new international students who might travel to the country at this time. However, the initial resumption of in-person activity will represent a key step on the pathway to recovery for the ELE sector in Ireland. My Department will continue to engage with ELE stakeholders as this sector moves, aligned with public health advice, including any such advice in relation to international travel, towards its full re-opening and continues on a path to recovery.</p></reply>

My Department has achieved a number of key policy initiatives since its establishment which are helping to transform the landscape for tertiary education and for research and innovation in Ireland, providing a foundation for a leading knowledge-driven economy equipped for the future world of work as well as a bedrock for sustainable development of a more inclusive society for all.  Key achievements include:</p><p>- The national Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-24, <i>&ldquo;Future FET: Transforming Learning&rdquo;</i>was launched in July 2020 and is framed around a vision for future FET in Ireland. Priorities for the sector are set out across three core pillars: building skills; creating pathways, and; fostering inclusion. There is also a strong focus on enabling themes, including staffing, capital investment and measurement and data.</p><p>- The &ldquo;<i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025&rdquo;</i>was launched in April 2021 and sets out a roadmap to fully embedding apprenticeship as an option for employers and learners across all sectors of the economy.  Under the Plan, a National Apprenticeship Office will be established as a joint office of SOLAS and the HEA.  Employer and partner engagement will continue through the establishment of a National Apprenticeship Alliance.</p><p>- My Department has been leading in collaboration with further and higher education stakeholders to provide direction and guidance throughout the pandemic with a focus on continuity in provision of service in a manner consistent with public health advice.  Most recently I published the plan for a safe return to campus for September 2021, with the proposal being for mainly on-site activity for all students, learners, and staff.  In addition, there will be some on-site provision over the summer months including on-site presence for apprentices, English Language Education, and the resumption of research activity, with appropriate protective measures in place.</p><p>- A &euro;168 million package was also provided for third-level institutions and students, in order to cover costs incurred during the pandemic and to support students returning to college, including a doubling of the student assistant fund and &euro;15m to support student access to technology including laptops.  </p><p>- A public consultation to inform the development of the next National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education was launched in April 2021. The third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (2015-2021) sets out the Department&rsquo;s current strategy to address underrepresentation in higher education by those groups identified in the plan. The vision of the current National Access Plan (NAP) is to ensure that the student body entering into, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland's population.</p><p>- Government approval was obtained for the General Scheme of a Bill to reform the Higher Education Authority legislation and the General Scheme was published in May 2021. This marks a very significant milestone in a process to reform out-dated legislation and to put in place a new system with an appropriate balance between autonomy and accountability.</p><p>- In May 2021 Technological University status was granted to Athlone and Limerick Institutes of Technology. This is the third Technological University to be created since 2019 and shows a significant advancement of the programme to transform the landscape of higher education in Ireland, also critical in the catalysing greater regional collaboration and development.</p><p>- A National Consultation on the future of research and innovation in Ireland was launched in June 2021. This includes an online public consultation process which will take place over the coming weeks. In addition, key stakeholders across research, innovation, industry and civic society, will engage in a number of discussion fora. The outcomes from these consultation processes will mean stakeholders and the wider public will have a key voice to help inform the National Research and Innovation Strategy. </p><p>- A number of key interventions have helped in the context of the increased need for upskilling and reskilling in the context of the economic fallout from the pandemic, including initiatives under the July 2020 Stimulus package which provided an additional 35,500 places in the higher and further education sector and with 10,000 free courses for unemployed, self-employed or returners to work under Springboard+ 2021 announced in June 2021.</p><p>- A consultation on the 10-year Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy was undertaken in late 2020. Work on the development of this Strategy is ongoing with SOLAS and the Strategy is due to be launched in the near future.  A review of the SUSI grant system is also currently underway.  The review will determine if the grant system reflects the realities of the current student experience with a view to facilitating access and underpinning an inclusive approach.</p></reply>

A range of supports and measures are in place, which include the following:</p>  <p>  The main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme. Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine. Further information in relation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website, www.susi.ie. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874.</p>  <p>  Equity of Access to Higher Education continues to be a national priority for the Government and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. The Programme for Government reflects the importance of supporting learners at risk of education disadvantage and learners with special education needs in higher education. The vision of National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 is that the student body entering, participating in, and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population. The plan set out five goals and more than thirty actions, developed following widespread consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of supporting increased access and participation in higher education by six main target groups.  </p>  <p>  Those groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first-time mature students, students with disabilities, part-time/flexible learners, further education and training award holders; and Irish Travellers. The plan also indicated subgroups that require support, including lone parents, teen parents and ethnic minorities. Improving equity of access to higher education is an ongoing objective. </p>  <p>  There are three main funding streams which support the implementation of the National Access Plan. These are:</p>  <p>  -  The Programme for Access to Higher Education;</p>  <p>  -  The Student Assistance Fund; and</p>  <p>  -  The Fund for Students with Disabilities</p>  <p>  There are three strands to the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) with an overall funding envelope of &euro;40.4m. Strand 1 supports access to initial teacher education from the target groups identified in the National Access Plan. Strand 2 provides bursaries of &euro;5,000 to students who have been identified by their higher education institution as being the most socio-economically disadvantaged students in the target groups under the National Access Plan. Strand 3 supports regional clusters of higher education institutions with the aim of attracting additional students from groups currently under-represented in higher education. </p>  <p>  A new National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education will be developed in 2021 for the years 2022-2026. Consultations on the approach to the development of the Plan is on-going.</p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award (NQF level 6-10) in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF. The core allocation for the SAF is &euro;9.1 million per annum which is expected to support circa 14,000 students.  This includes &euro;1 million which was added to the fund in 2017 for part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups. Prior to that the fund supported full-time students only. An additional &euro;1 million was added to the fund in 2018 for students attending Professional Masters of Education (PME) courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This additional funding was also made available for the 2019/20 year and again in 2020/21. </p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education. The FSD is one of the main funding sources supporting participation by students with disabilities in approved further and higher education courses in Ireland. It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries. The actual level of support to be provided to individual students is decided by each HEI who carry out a needs assessment to determine the types of supports and accommodations needed. The 2020 allocation to the fund is &euro;9.6m which is expected to support circa 14,000 students. A significant development with this Fund has been the inclusion of students on part-time courses in 2018 and this continued into 2019 and 2020 also.</p>  <p>  A progress review of the National Access Plan, published in December 2018, acknowledges a number of significant positive developments and characterises the first phase of implementation of the NAP as a period of achievement and investment. A major element of both progress to date and the future implementation of the plan has been the increased investment in new access initiatives since the original publication of the National Access Plan (NAP).</p>  <p>  The objectives of the National Access Plan are supported by a range of interventions and programmes:</p>  <p>  In response to the lower than anticipated progress for Travellers, an Action Plan for Increasing Traveller Participation in Higher Education 2019-2021 was launched in 2019 and its aim is to advance Traveller participation in higher education within the context of approaches on retention and transition of Travellers across the education spectrum.</p>  <p>  A study commissioned by the Higher Education Authority on the challenges facing mature students participation in higher education has recently been published.  The finding of the report will be considered in the context of the new National Access Plan 2022 &ndash; 2026 commencing in 2022. </p>  <p>  In 2020 approximately &euro;42 million within the core funding allocated to HEIs was in recognition of the additional costs of recruiting and retaining students from National Access Plan target groups, including students with disabilities. This enables all HEIs to have an access infrastructure, including disability support services, in place that provides for the pre-entry and post-entry work required to support students from target groups access and successfully complete higher education.</p>  <p>  Persons in the protection process (asylum and subsidiary protection) or leave to remain process are not eligible to access the statutory based SUSI grant scheme. However, the administratively based Student Support Scheme provides supports along similar lines to the SUSI grant scheme and is available to persons in the asylum, subsidiary protection or leave to remain process.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provided for enhanced postgraduate supports from the 2021/22 academic year including the fee grant amount rising from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500 and the income threshold for eligibility for these grants increasing from &euro;31,500, now &euro;54,240. This is an initial step in meeting part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding SUSI grant support. </p>  <p>  Apart from the student grant and dedicated access supports it is important to note the range of additional supports which have been put in place for students as part of Budget 2021 and as part of the Government's COVID response last year.  </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to the continued the roll-out of supports for students and targeted initiatives to support delivery of the vision and targets within the National Access Plan.  </p>  <p>  The level of funding available in the Student Assistance Fund for 2020 was doubled;</p>  <p>  -  &euro;1.9m in the form of a once-off COVID-19 contingency fund to enable HEIs deliver local COVID-19 responses to support disadvantaged students;</p>  <p>  -  The level of funding for the 1916 Bursary Fund (also known as PATH 2) increased to &euro;5 million per annum, which will provide an additional 200 bursaries, bringing the total number for 2021 to 1,000 bursaries for the most disadvantaged students in the country; </p>  <p>  -  An additional &euro;20 million in funding for SUSI in 2021 to cover increased applications to the scheme;</p>  <p>  -  &euro;6 million allocated to enhance SUSI support for postgraduates;</p>  <p>  -  &euro;15 million scheme to support access to laptops and digital devices;</p>  <p>  -  &euro;50 million to provide financial assistance to full time third level students in recognition of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on this group. This funding will offer financial assistance to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions (HEI).  </p>  <p>  -  &euro;300,000 has been secured through the Dormant Accounts Fund for targeted supports to address the implications of COVID-19 on Traveller participation in higher education in 2021.</p>  <p>  Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training Strategy (FET) 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including persons with a disability, members of the Traveller and Roma communities, migrants and the unemployed, with the aim of enabling every citizen to participate fully in society.</p>  <p>  SOLAS, working closely with my Department, has established multi-annual strategic performance agreements with the 16 ETBs. These agreements place a clear emphasis on inclusion for all. In terms of promoting equity, one of the most significant features of these new agreements is the setting of quantitative targets for inclusion of priority cohorts, which are derived from a combination of specifically identified local needs and government strategies and action plans, as well as the relevant EU strategies and policies. The channelling of specific programme budgets and/or resources towards provision for a particular priority group or cohort would be a decision to be made by individual ETBs. </p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 which was published in April the impacts of, and outcomes from, existing access to apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programmes as well as other interventions across the sector will be examined to provide an evidence base for best practice and future interventions to deliver an apprentice population which better reflects the general population.</p></reply>

It is not intended to cover the full costs of attending college. The student grant scheme does however, provide for different levels of maintenance support, depending on means.  Grants are also provided at adjacent and non-adjacent rates.  The higher non-adjacent rates are intended to provide additional support to those students who may be living away from home.</p>  <p>  Budget 2011 provided for a number of student grant measures which came into effect for the 2011/12 academic year, including the change in the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant from 24 kilometres to 45 kilometres.</p>  <p>  The 24km distance criterion was originally set in 1968 and had not been updated in more than 40 years. Since then, significant improvements have taken place in the road and rail network and it is considered that the revised distance criteria is more consistent with the type of distances that students may legitimately be expected to commute to college.</p>  <p>  The current qualifying distance of 45km for the higher non-adjacent rate of student grant takes into account a reasonable radius within which students may commute on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  The cost of reversing the change to the distance criteria in the Student Grant, is estimated to be in the region of &euro;28.5m.The Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports.

I also recognise and acknowledge the crucial role front-line workers are continuing to play in responding to the threat of COVID-19. They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.  </p>  <p>  For those who are in the international protection process, our objective is to have decisions made on their applications, including the permission to remain consideration, as soon as possible. This ensures that those who are found to be in need of our protection can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security. </p>  <p>  In the context of the permission to remain element of the process, each case is given a detailed consideration on its individual merits under all of the prescribed headings, which includes a full consideration of their private and family rights in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, among other issues, before a decision is taken to grant or to refuse permission to remain.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that the issuing of letters recommending the refusal of international protection and permission to remain have been suspended since December and for the duration of Level 5 restrictions. The question of recommencing issuing these decisions will be kept under review in the coming weeks as the situation regarding international travel eases.</p>  <p>  The same position also applies to the making and service of deportation orders, with the exception of some very limited circumstances in cases where an individual may be a threat to national security or whose presence in Ireland would be contrary to the public interest.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can advise the Deputy that in cases where a Deportation Order has been made, section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) provides a mechanism under which a person subject to a Deportation Order can make a formal request to have that order revoked. Any such request, however, will need to be founded on new information or materially changed circumstances which have arisen since the decision to make the Deportation Order was taken.

My Department will maintain an oversight role on the implementation of the scoping report, in close cooperation and coordination with other departments as well as the Louth local authority.</p>  <p>  The publication of the implementation plan for the Drogheda Scoping Exercise is a key action in the Justice Plan 2021. As well as publishing the scoping report, my Department has identified some actions for early implementation which can be progressed in line with the finalisation of the implementation plan. As part of the input being sought from departments, the implementation plan will outline resources being put into the community in Drogheda. I look forward to bringing the implementation plan to Government in the near future. </p>  <p>  I would further note that all applications for funding in any area of community safety that are received by my Department are welcome, and will receive appropriate and thorough consideration as part of the relevant funding assessment process.</p></reply>

The Justice Plan 2021 was published earlier this year and outlines a wide range of actions under the Department's five strategic goals, which are:</p><p>1. Tackle crime, enhance national security and transform policing</p><p>2. Improve access to justice and modernise the courts system</p><p>3. Strengthen community safety, reduce reoffending, support victims and combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence</p><p>4. Deliver a fair immigration system for a digital age</p><p>5.Accelerate innovation, digital transformation and climate action across the justice sector</p><p>Under the Justice Plan 2021, I am progressing a suite of policy and legislative reforms which are priorities for me as Minister, in line with the various commitments set out in the Programme for Government.</p><p>My Department has made substantial progress on delivery reforms recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing, including publication of the landmark General Scheme of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which provides for wide-ranging and coherent reform of policing by improving the performance and accountability of our policing and security services, and supporting the human rights of all people throughout Ireland to be and feel safe in their communities.</p><p>Further key actions to tackle crime include the publication earlier this year of the General Scheme of the Hate Crime Bill; the publication of the Hamilton Review and subsequent implementation plan on tackling white collar crime; delivering on Ireland&rsquo;s successful connection to Schengen Information System (SIS II) which has already led to an increased number of arrests; and enactment of the Criminal Procedure Act 2021 will improve efficiencies in the criminal trial process, by introducing preliminary trial hearings for the first time.</p><p>The Peter Kelly Report, <i>Reform of Civil Justice in the State</i>has been published and we have also progressed work to reform the family justice system. Last September, Government approved the General Scheme of the Family Court Bill which will restructure the family justice system to enable jurisdictions in appropriate Courts. In parallel, the Family Justice Oversight Group are working to develop a new family justice system. </p><p>We have also published the General Scheme of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill which will replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board with a new Commission and established a Judicial Planning Working Group to work on judicial numbers over the medium term. On the issue of gambling reform, the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019 came into effect in December 2020.  Work is ongoing to established a gambling regulator. </p><p>Strengthen the safety of all communities is a cross-Government priority and we are establishing three pilots of Local Community Safety Partnerships (in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Longford and Waterford) which will inform the roll-out of the new Community Safety model nationwide.</p><p>As the Deputy will know, we are making strides in providing greater supports to victims of crime, and combating domestic, sexual and gender based violence and have published and begun to implement <i>Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey,</i>our plan to implement the recommendations of the O&rsquo;Malley Review.  We have enacted Coco&rsquo;s Law - the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act.  </p><p>To support young people and divert them away from crime, a new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 has been put in place and is being implemented; we have established an Anti-Social Behaviour Forum to bring forward proposals to tackle the issue of anti-social behaviour and have published the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Exploitation of Children in the Commission of Offences) Bill. I also expect to publish an implementation plan to deliver on the recommendations put forward in the Drogheda Scoping Report shortly. </p><p>In terms of developments in the immigration area, work on an end-to-end review of processes to guide enhanced processing times has been completed.  We have announced draft proposals for a scheme to regularise thousands of undocumented migrants in Ireland and introduced a temporary system to enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a <i>statutory declaration</i>of loyalty.</p><p>Of course it is important to note that all the above mentioned milestones and achievements are just a snapshot of the substantial programme of work being delivered on by my Department. The full Justice Plan 2021 is available at:</p><p>I intend to publish regular reports outlining progress on these actions on my Department&rsquo;s website and my Department will continue to work with our agencies and partners across the sector to receive feedback and ensure that the targets set out in the Plan are met. I look forward to publishing a mid-year report outlining progress in due course.</p></reply>

This exceeds the 3% target of employment of persons with disabilities set in the Disability Act 2005. </p><p>The Department is currently working with members of the Traveller and Roma Community to launch an internship programme for members of their community later this year. This internship programme was developed in line with the National Traveller and Roma Community Inclusion Strategy (2017 &ndash; 2021) and aims to promote the participation and inclusion of the Traveller and Roma community in Irish society. </p><p>This year the Department will roll out Disability and Autism Awareness training to all staff in line with the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2121. </p><p>My Department takes part in the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) programme; an initiative of the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD), which offers a six-month paid mentored work experience placement to graduates with disabilities. There are currently two graduates with disabilities on WAM placements. </p><p><b><i>The Courts Service</i></b></p><p>The Courts Service understands and takes seriously its statutory duty to eliminate discrimination, promote equality and protect the human rights of all staff and service users. </p><p>A Human Rights and Equality Working Group has been established, which works to assess and identify the human rights and equality issues that are relevant to the functions of the Courts. The group meets weekly to identify the policies and practices that are already in place, and to determine those that should be implemented across the organisation in a bid to address any inequality.</p><p>The Courts Service is strongly committed to meeting the requirements set out under the Civil Service Code of Practice for the Employment of People with Disabilities. </p><p>Its 2020 Staff Disability Census indicated that 5.5% of current staff reported having a disability. This is on target to meet the Government increase to the public service employment target for persons with disabilities from a minimum of 3% to 6% by 2024.</p><p><b><i>Irish Prison Service</i></b></p><p>The Irish Prison Service is exempt from the Public Sector Employment disability target in respect of Recruit Prison Officers but is committed to enabling access to employment for persons from minority and disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p><b><i>The Probation Service</i></b></p><p>One of the key organisations funded by the Probation Service is the Irish Association for Social Inclusion Opportunities (IASIO). </p><p>The largest of IASIO's programmes, <b>Linkage</b>is a training, employment and guidance service, which supports offenders to integrate into the working community. </p><p><b><i>Legal Aid Board</i></b></p><p>The Legal Aid Board reports that 6% of staff reported having a disability in 2020.</p><p><b><i>Legal Services Regulatory Authority</i></b></p><p>The Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA) is working to increase the public sector employment target of persons with disabilities from 3% to 6% by 2024, and will embed this target into all LSRA workforce planning and recruitment policies. </p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission</i></b></p><p>All open recruitment to posts in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is conducted by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) which operates an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (ED&amp;amp;I) Strategy, which recognises and values the importance of attracting and welcoming a workforce that is responsive, accessible, resilient, and reflective of the communities it serves.  </p><p>This strategy is in line with the Vision, Mission and Values stated in GSOC&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy for the period 2021-2023. Based on these principles, GSOC will continue to work with PAS towards ensuring that persons from minority and disadvantaged communities are encouraged to apply for suitable employment opportunities as they arise in the organisation.</p><p><b><i>International Protection Appeals Tribunal</i></b></p><p>Since  January 2020 the tribunal has facilitated two internships under the Willing and Able Mentoring Programme. These six-month placements are for graduates who have a disability. </p><p><b><i>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</i></b></p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy 2020-2021 outlines its commitment to 'attract, develop and retain a diverse workforce to support delivery of an effective policing service to the communities they serve'.</p><p>The EDI Strategy contains a number of specific actions to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to fulfil this goal including Action 5; 'Support the development of a diversity recruitment roadmap'. </p><p>In January 2021 a consultative exercise was completed by eight civil society organisations and serving personnel with diverse backgrounds within AGS. There was positive engagement, and constructive feedback was provided on the recruitment and retention barriers encountered by members of various disadvantaged and minority communities. </p><p>A draft implementation plan outlining short and medium terms initiatives to address the barriers identified has been developed. In addition to these initiatives, this implementation plan includes:</p><p>- Recruitment targets for groups currently under-represented within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na based on current baselines and national census data.</p><p>- A commitment to improve equality data collection and analysis at each phase of the recruitment journey, in partnership with the Public Appointment Service.</p><p>- A commitment to review international norms and best practices in police vetting procedures (a highly complex barrier identified during the consultation requiring a more long-term approach).</p><p>Implementation of this plan is scheduled to happen in advance of the 2021 Garda Trainee Competition. </p><p>Over 500 young people in socio-economically disadvantaged areas applied to the upcoming Garda Access Programme. The successful candidates will be placed in suitable roles across the organisation for nine and eleven month paid placements. The interns will also benefit from a bespoke training and development programme, which aims to develop their knowledge of policing and the criminal justice sector, and to increase key workplace skills.  </p><p>Shortlisting is currently underway with interviews anticipated to be held the week beginning 28/06/21.</p><p><b><i>Policing Authority</i></b></p><p>The Policing Authority is an equal opportunity employer, it conducts competitions in a fair and inclusive manner in line with the CPSA Code of Practice, and facilitates all reasonable accommodations necessary for staff who may have additional requirements. </p><p>The Authority is very aware of its commitments in this regard and despite its small numbers, exceeds the 3% target for employment of persons with disabilities.</p></reply>

The structure of the Project is that four Working Groups, each chaired by an independent person and made up of stakeholders from the Forestry Policy Group, report to a Project Board, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department.</p>  <p>  Working Group 3 is, among other things, developing a communication strategy, including a Customer Charter.  The Customer Charter will include timelines for the issuing of forestry licences and it is within this Group that all matters in relation to timelines will be considered.</p>  <p>  Working Group 4 is concentrating on licencing process improvements. This Group has indicated that it intends to recommend to the Project Board that an independent review of the regulatory process, taking account of international practice, be commissioned. This will include an examination of the criteria used for screening for Appropriate Assessment under the Habitats Directive.</p>  <p>  As regards the increase from 3km to 15km for screening purposes the advice referred to was received from our external environmental consultants at the time. When added to NPWS guidance and decisions from the Forestry Appeals Committee, the Department moved from a screening distance of 3km to 15km to consider all European sites within that distance. </p>  <p>  The work currently underway and due to be undertaken to examine the licensing process within Project Woodland will, I hope, lead to an improvement in output which will benefit the forestry sector as a whole.</p></reply>

Mechanical grading in beef factories is underpinned by two pieces of EU legislation which came into force in July 2018. Carcase classification is also governed by S.I. 249 of 2019.</p>  <p>  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1184 of 20 April 2017 sets out the legal tolerances for the authorisation of a mechanical classification system. The figure of 40% referred to by the Deputy relates to the authorisation procedure for  a mechanical classification system and not the operation of machines. Using a system of points and limits defined in the EU legislation, a mechanical classification system must achieve an accuracy figure in excess of 60% for conformation and fat cover  in order for it to be authorised for use in any EU state.  Irish legislation is fully aligned with EU regulation in this regard.</p>  <p>  Unannounced checks by classification officers verify the on-going accuracy of the automated beef grading methods using the same system of points and limits defined in the EU legislation. In 2020, during 314 checks, across the 22 mechanical grading factories, the average performance for conformation in 2020 was 93.3% and 95.6% for fat cover.</p>  <p>  The role of the Department is clearly defined in the Irish legislation in terms of monitoring and supervision of classification. This legislation is constantly kept under review.</p></reply>

The average number of inspections significantly exceed the requirement under the relevant EU legislation. The EU legal requirement for monitoring classification is a minimum of eight inspections per factory per year and must include a minimum of 40 carcasses at each inspection. </p><p>In each of the past five years, including 2021 to date, the average number of inspections per factory was 18 with an average of 85 carcasses inspected at each inspection.  The number of inspections in 2020 was reduced because of COVID-19 restrictions but continued to exceed the number required by legislation.</p><p>Unannounced checks by classification officers verify the on-going accuracy of the automated beef grading methods by using a system of points and limits defined in EU legislation. The mechanical classification method must operate within legally defined tolerances at all times. As with any mechanical system, grading machines can from time to time fall out of tolerance. The suspension of mechanical grading following an inspection by the Department is summarised in the table below. To date in 2021, mechanical classification was suspended on one occasion following an inspection by classification officers. </p><p>Where a machine is found operating outside of tolerance, the factory is instructed to cease mechanical classification. When any mechanical system is found to be working outside of these tolerances, the meat plants concerned are instructed to revert to manual grading.  In this scenario, the factory must arrange for the classification machine to be serviced. When this service is completed, the classification section is notified, and classification officers will proceed to conduct a further classification exercise (min 100 carcasses) to confirm that it is in working within the legal tolerances before mechanical grading is allowed to recommence. Farmers are advised through their remittance dockets where manual grading is applied.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Number of Inspections</th>       <th>Number of Instances where a machine was turned off   following an Inspection by the Department of Agriculture</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>616</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>628</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>550</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>580</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>405</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 to date</td>       <td>132</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The allocation of 400 tonnes for a fishery for smaller vessels using hook and line as a means of fishing was set down in Ministerial Policy in 2010. The Minister amended the Mackerel policy in July 2017 after intensive review and public consultation. This amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery.  </p>  <p>  The mackerel Policy sets down  that the hook and line fishery for vessels under 15m in overall length receive 400t.  </p>  <p>  In order to amend Mackerel Policy, I as Minister must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect of policy, it would require due process involving an assessment of all issues arising, including full public consultation.  </p>  <p>  There has been for the past 20 years or so intensive competition within the industry for access to and a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU/U.K. Trade and Co-operation Agreement provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel  quota by 2026 to the U.K.  This will only increase demands for higher shares of Ireland&rsquo;s quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet.  It is worth noting that the 400t for the hook and line fishery has not been reduced.  Unfortunately the situation is that if there is an increase for any sector, such as the hook and line fishery, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the EU/ U.K. TCA.</p>  <p>  The National Inshore Forum prepared a paper requesting to increase for the hook and line fishery from the 400t limit to 3,000 tonnes and to increase the trip limit from 750kg to 1,500kg.  An increase in the overall 400t limit is set down in Policy.  The other elements of this paper and improved management arrangements for the fishery were discussed by the Quota Management Advisory Committee.</p></reply>

This requires a two-handed approach, comprised of support for our existing and potential future UK trade, as well as further development and diversification in EU and third country markets.</p>  <p>  The Department and its agencies have invested hugely in this work and encouragingly, despite an extremely challenging year in 2020, exports totalled &euro;14.3 billion, with 37% of agri-food exports going to the UK, which is down from 40% in 2016, the year the UK voted to leave the EU.  Remaining agri-food exports in 2020 were split between the EU-27 market (31%) and international market (32%) in 2020.</p>  <p>  The UK remains a priority market for Irish agri-food exporters.  The Trade and Cooperation Agreement reached by the EU and the UK provides for zero tariffs and quotas, and is welcome given the highly integrated Ireland-UK supply chains and the value of trade in both directions.  It will assist Irish exporters to maintain their UK market share, and to remain competitive against third country imports to the UK.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to be very active in the development of third country markets through Trade Missions and key customer engagements; these were carried out virtually in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also continuing to work on the opportunities provided by recent EU Free Trade Agreements with third countries, and to press for the removal of technical market access barriers across a range of third country markets.</p></reply>

They include regulatory and taxation measures and aim to mobilise private investment. It would be difficult, and indeed misleading, to identify their Exchequer cost.  </p><p>The Climate Action Plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The step-up in ambition in each of the sectors covered by the Plan will require investment across the entire economy. Overall, through the mix of technologies and measures identified, the Plan sets out the pathway that represents the least-cost burden to the economy as a whole. A significant portion of the technologies and measures set out in the Plan will result also in net lifetime cost savings to the economy as a whole.</p><p>In terms of costs to the Exchequer and other public funding, the Plan will be funded through Project Ireland 2040 which provides &euro;30 billion for low carbon and sustainable mobility investments in the period to 2027.</p><p>Many of the actions in the plan do not require public funding. The actions contained in this plan fall broadly into four categories:</p><p>- public funding provided in the annual estimates process and in Project Ireland 2040</p><p>- measures such as setting a long-term trajectory for the carbon tax, in order to change long-term behaviour and decisions to encourage investment in more sustainable choices</p><p>- new regulations to end certain practices (e.g. phasing out oil and gas boilers in homes or introducing low emission zones in cities)</p><p>- actions to promote public and community engagement and participation in reducing our emissions. </p><p>For the first time, a decarbonisation target has been set for each sector. Each Government Department must now determine the optimum approach to utilising the funding available to it to support the policies necessary to meet the targets proposed for each sector. The exact costs will be determined from the detailed policy design work which will consist of a mix of regulations, taxes, and subsidies which the Government may choose to deploy to achieve the target abatement range in each sector. </p><p>It should also be noted that there would also be a very significant cost to the Exchequer for not implementing any policies to achieve compliance with our 2030 targets, which would also lock Ireland into a high carbon trajectory that would be unsustainable in the long-run.</p><p>The NDP Review process is underway to update capital allocations for all Government Departments to 2030 and that, as per the phase one report of the NDP review that has already been published (), the NDP Review will be consistent with recent and upcoming commitments from the Irish Government to become carbon neutral by 2050 and to meet the more immediate climate targets by 2030.</p></reply>

These include the following:</p><p><b>SICAP</b></p><p>The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) is Ireland&rsquo;s primary social inclusion funding intervention. SICAP 2018 &ndash; 2022 aims to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality by supporting disadvantaged communities and individuals. </p><p>Under SICAP, funding is provided to Local Development Companies to allow them to carry out work locally to help disadvantaged individuals and the groups that represent those individuals.  The programme is managed by the Local Community Development Committee (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area.</p><p>SICAP has 2 programme goals. Goal one is supporting communities, which involves supporting local community groups representing disadvantaged communities and target groups so that they can work towards solving social exclusion issues that affect them.  Goal two involves supporting individuals who have been identified as being in need to improve their life chances.  This can be through lifelong learning and training, getting labour market supports to improve work readiness, or working with people in broader and more holistic ways so that they can improve their quality of life and general well-being. </p><p>SICAP 2018-2022 continues to prioritise supports to those who are most marginalised and disproportionately affected by poverty.  The following 13 target groups are engaged with under the Programme:  Disadvantaged Children and Families; Disadvantaged Young People (aged 15 &ndash; 24); Disadvantaged Women; Lone Parents; Low Income Workers/Households; New Communities; People living in Disadvantaged Communities; People with Disabilities; Travellers; Roma; The Unemployed; The Disengaged from the Labour Market (Economically Inactive); Emerging needs category as selected by the LCDC.</p><p>In 2020 SICAP helped 26,178 people and they received in excess of 108,000 supports. Of this, 43% were from a jobless household, 27% were long-term unemployed, and 17% were under 25 and 9% were people with a disability. 6,067 people completed a lifelong learning course. 1,057 people got jobs and 1,274 set up their own business. 2,687 community groups were helped &amp;amp; they received in excess of 19,000 supports. 448 Social enterprises were also supported through SICAP.</p><p><b>Community Services Programme (CSP)</b></p><p>The Community Services Programme (CSP) currently supports more than 420 community organisations to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model. CSP funding is provided as a fixed annual contribution of &euro;32,000 towards the cost of a manager and &euro;19,033 towards an agreed number of full-time equivalent positions.</p><p>The programme focuses on communities where public and private sector services are lacking, either through geographical or social isolation or because of demand deficits. It supports a range of community business and social enterprises, including Local Development Companies, to deliver a diverse range of local services and employment opportunities. </p><p>CSP supported organisations must employ at least 70% of their CSP supported full time equivalents (FTEs), from across the following target groups, who are deemed most distant from the labour market, which include persons with a disability, members of the Traveller community, those most distant from the labour market, unemployed people, stabilised and recovering drug misusers and people with convictions who are in contact with the probation service. </p><p><b>Libraries Development</b></p><p>The public library service provides the Work Matters programme which promotes the library as a space to support the information and research needs of people who are seeking employment, changing career or wishing to up-skill. </p><p><b>Social Enterprise</b></p><p>Social enterprises operate in a wide range of areas including health care, environment and housing. Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISEs), support disadvantaged people to prepare for, and participate in, the labour market. The continued implementation of the National Social Enterprise Policy for Ireland will support the development of social enterprises including those providing valuable services to disadvantaged communities.</p><p><b>Our Rural Future</b></p><p>My Department's mission is &ldquo;To promote rural and community development and to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland&quot;.</p><p>A key element of this mission are the inclusive communities.  A key component of delivering on this mission is regular, ongoing and meaningful engagement with rural and community development stakeholders working to enhance the quality of life in our communities.</p><p>&lsquo;<i>Our Rural Future</i>- Rural Development Policy 2021-2025&rsquo; was published on 29 March 2021 and is the most ambitious and transformational policy for rural development in Ireland for decades.</p><p>The policy focuses on optimising opportunities for individuals, communities and businesses and promotes inclusivity and social cohesion, placing people and communities at the heart of the measures for delivery.  It contains more than 150 commitments, across the whole-of-Government, each of which is aligned to at least one UN Sustainable Development Goal.  Some of these commitments specifically support minority cohorts in rural areas, including measures geared towards access to employment, such as investment in digital connectivity and remote working infrastructure, further education and training/upskilling, each led by the relevant Government Department.</p><p><i>Our Rural Future</i>was developed after an extensive consultation process and, as a result, it recognises the key needs of people living and working in rural areas.</p><p>My Department will continue to engage with and listen to communities as we implement the Policy over the next five years as ongoing consultation will play a key role allowing us to maximise the impact of <i>Our Rural Future</i>and to develop additional measures for inclusion in the Policy.  </p><p><b>The Department and its Agencies</b></p><p>The Department of Rural and Community Development was established on 19th July 2017 to provide a renewed and consolidated focus on rural and community development in Ireland.</p><p>Open recruitment for my Department is done through the Public Appointments Service (PAS) who have their own independent Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy that they adhere to. This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s own recently launched Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Vision Statement and Maturity Model for the Public Service. </p><p>The EDI Vision Statement and Maturity Model&rsquo;s aim is to &ldquo;promote equality, diversity and inclusion&rdquo;. It is important that the Public Service achieves greater equality of opportunity, gender balance, diversity and inclusion across its workforce. It is also important that a consistent approach is taken, in line with equality legislation, to ensure that the Public Service is generally representative of society and respects and promotes human rights.</p><p>My Department has a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) in place whose role is to assist and support staff with disabilities under the guidance of the National Disability Authority. This would include onboarding of new staff that require reasonable accommodation in their workplace. The DLO also plays an important role in promoting awareness about disability across the department and would support staff with disabilities when they are seeking job new opportunities and promotions.</p><p>Please note, the recruitment for the four agencies is a matter for the relevant boards and management of those agencies as they are independent entities.</p></reply>
