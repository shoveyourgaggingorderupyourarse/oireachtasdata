We discussed the latest situation on Covid-19 and the measures being taken in response, including in relation to travel.  We discussed the similarity of approach across many of the actions we are each taking in response to Covid.  We also discussed the issue of new variants of the virus and the importance of genome sequencing in detecting their presence. </p>  <p>  We also discussed the progress being made on resolving Passenger Locator Form issues between the two Health Departments, who have agreed that the Irish side will provide a passenger contact service for people who travel on to Northern Ireland after arrival in Ireland, as an interim measure, pending further work being finalised to facilitate transfer of data.  </p>  <p>  I also met by videoconference with the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, on Wednesday 13 January, when we also discussed the latest developments on Covid-19. </p>  <p>  We also had a very useful discussion on Covid-19 between the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive at the North South Ministerial Council  Plenary meeting on 18 December, which was hosted by the First Minister and deputy First Minister. </p>  <p>  In addition, Minister for Foreign Affairs,  Simon Coveney TD and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis MP  jointly chair Quad meetings which discuss the ongoing response to Covid-19 and  are also attended by the First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill.</p>  <p>  There is also regular contact between Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly and his Northern Ireland counterpart Minister Robin Swann, and between the Chief Medical Officers North and South.  There is also regular engagement at official level more generally, including through a series of meetings of officials from the Irish Government, the UK Government and the Northern Ireland Executive which are coordinated and jointly chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach and the Cabinet Office.</p></reply>

The Assembly has adapted its methods to comply with Public Health guidelines and resumed its work with online meetings in October 2020 with the aim of reporting by June 2021.  The experience of the current Assembly of operating on an online basis will inform the approach to the other Citizen's Assemblies to be undertaken in line with the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government, the Government aims to establish a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly in 2021 to consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin.   This Assembly will be established with a new Chairperson and new members following completion of the current Assembly.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government provides for establishment of Citizens' Assemblies to consider matters relating to drugs use; biodiversity; and the future of education.  Officials from my Department are engaging with officials from the relevant Departments on the approach to be taken with regard to these Assemblies.  It is envisaged that they will be established after the Dublin Mayor Citizen's Assembly has completed its work, but the specific timing of each Assembly has yet to be worked out. </p></reply>

Details of the wide range of supports available are on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>We are providing for an extension of the tax warehousing scheme to include repayments of Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme funds owed by employers and preliminary tax obligations for adversely affected businesses.</p><p>These measures are in addition to the July Stimulus &euro;7bn package of enterprise measures, which includes the Wage Subsidy Scheme extended through 2021, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst self-employed.</p><p>As announced in the July Stimulus, the Enterprise Support Grant was extended to assist eligible self-employed, including sole traders, who exit the PUP or jobseekers schemes to re-start their business. A self-employed person who closes their PUP should send their grant application to their local Intreo Centre to be processed.  Further information is available at www.gov.ie.</p><p>On the 9th of December, following engagement with the Arts sector and other self-employed sectors my colleague Minister Heather Humphreys T.D., Minister for Social Protection, announced the doubling of the PUP threshold from the current &euro;480 over four weeks to &euro;960 over an eight-week period effective immediately. This measure is to assist those who are trying to restart their businesses and will allow self-employed people to take on intermittent jobs without losing their entitlement to the PUP.</p><p>The Government also announced the provision of support of &euro;50m for the live entertainment sector in Budget 2021. This will include measures for the commercial entertainment sector and will support live entertainment across the country. The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders. It will also be informed by the pilot live performance scheme in 2020 which is being rolled out now.</p><p>I acknowledge the issue whereby businesses might not be eligible for the CRSS or other measures announced in the budget, such as the &euro;50 million fund for live entertainment.  I have asked my officials to work with other relevant Departments to identify the type and number of businesses that fall outside the scope of the CRSS, and to report back to me with proposals on how we could devise an amended or new scheme.</p><p>My colleagues, Minister Catherine Martin T.D., Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht and Minister Charlie McConalogue, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine may be able to provide more specific details on a roadmap to recovery for the events and hospitality industry, and details on supports for the food sector respectively.  </p></reply>

I fully appreciate how difficult the situation is for those involved and their families.</p>  <p>  While the Government cannot interfere with the High Court-overseen liquidation process, it has always sought to ensure that the concerns of workers are heard, and that the State&rsquo;s welfare, employment and training services are responding to the needs of the ex-Debenhams workers.</p>  <p>  The State has always guaranteed statutory employment rights to the workers, including statutory redundancy. This right has been honoured by the State at a cost of over &euro;13m.  </p>  <p>  The talks facilitated by the Chair of the Labour Court, Kevin Foley, concluded in December. In recognition of the exceptional circumstances of this case, as reflected in Kevin Foley&rsquo;s report, the Government said it was willing to allocate a fund of &euro;3 million to support career guidance, training, education and business start-ups for the former Debenham workers.</p>  <p>  On 13 January, the ex-Debenhams workers voted to reject the proposal for a &euro;3m Training Fund. I understand that the ex-Debenhams workers are disappointed that their expectations cannot be met.  There is also no legal scope for the Government to use the Social Insurance Fund to supplement or &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; redundancy payments to honour a collective agreement between an employer and its employees. </p>  <p>  At this stage, it appears that all avenues have been explored and exhausted and the Government awaits the outcome of the High Court process.</p></reply>

This guidance includes taking action such as isolating the worker and arranging transport home or to hospital for medical assessment if required. An employer must also carry out an assessment of the incident and arrange for appropriate cleaning of all work areas involved and co-operate with the Department of Public Health or HSE in relation to contact tracing. The full Work Safely Protocol is available on www.enterprise.ie </p>  <p>  Separately, the recently introduced Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Biological Agents) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 539 of 2020), now place greater reporting requirements on employers in relation to categories of workers exposed to Biological Agents in the course of their normal work activities including exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for COVID-19. The Regulations now cover several specific types of work activities which were previously not covered by the Biological Agents Regulations. </p>  <p>  Employees can contract COVID-19 through occupational exposure to the virus, for example, in a research laboratory or incidentally from work activities which by their nature involve potential specific exposure to the virus, for example, working with a COVID-19 patient, handling infected waste or carrying out diagnostic testing for COVID-19 in a laboratory. Under the Biological Agents Regulations where a person&rsquo;s work activity involves occupational exposure to SARS-COV-2 an employer must carry out a specific &ldquo;biological agent&rdquo; risk assessment and, also, has reporting requirements where infection has been acquired by the employee. </p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority is currently carrying out a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) to support consideration of a proposal by the Board of the Health and Safety Authority to require employers to report cases of Covid-19 that are attributable to work activity to the Authority.

The Scheme is available to SMEs, small Mid-Caps (up to 499 employees) and primary producers and will run until 30 June 2020 in accordance with the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Temporary Framework.</p>  <p>  The guarantee schemes operating under the Credit Guarantee Act, which includes the CCGS, are based on contingent liability. What this means is that there is no cost to the State unless a participating enterprise is unable to pay back the loan for more than 90 days, whereupon the loan enters a default stage and the finance provider can call on the guarantee for 80 percent of the outstanding balance. These demands will be called on through the operator of the scheme, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI). </p>  <p>  In such a scheme there is no upfront cost to the state in the allocations to finance providers. The finance provider issues loans utilising their own funds. Allocations under the scheme were assessed in depth by the agency with the relevant market knowledge, the SBCI, in accordance with the finance providers market share and ability to manage a suitably sized loan book.   </p>  <p>  While the State provides an 80 percent guarantee on these loans, this Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process in relation to loans offered under the Scheme, which, is fully delegated to the participating lenders. &euro;26 million has been set aside in Budget 2021 for potential calls on the guarantee by finance providers and to cover operational costs.  </p>  <p>There have been over &euro;260 million in loan applications from 3953 Irish businesses in the four months since the launch of the CCGS up to the 22nd   of January. Since the New Year, 19 Credit Unions and 3 non-bank lenders have also joined the scheme adding greater geographical reach and diversification in loan products available.  </p></reply>

This action by the US resulted in steel originally destined for the US market being diverted to the EU with the associated risk of flooding the EU market with steel products to the detriment of Union industry and producers.</p>  <p>  In response, in 2018, the European Commission brought forward Safeguard Measures to manage the volume of steel entering the Single Market from 3rd countries. The Measures currently in place allow for the importation of steel from 3rd countries by way of quotas, determined in line with traditional volumes of trade in steel using the 2015-2017 reference period. Steel imports outside of the quota limits are subject to a 25% tariff on landing in the EU. These current Measures are due to expire at the end of June 2021, unless prolonged after further review.</p>  <p>Due to the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union, as of 1st   January 2021, the UK is no longer party to the EU&rsquo;s Measures and the UK is now a 3rd country in relation to the application of the EU&rsquo;s Safeguard Measures. Under the EU&rsquo;s Safeguards, the UK - now operating as a 3rd country - has been allocated its own specific quotas for the majority of the EU&rsquo;s 26 product categories subject to the Measures.  Furthermore, in anticipation of the UK&rsquo;s new status as a 3rd country, in September 2020, the UK Government issued a notice stating that it would establish its own set of Safeguard Measures and "transition" 19 of the 26 product categories subject of EU Safeguards from the 1st January 2021. The UK has also calculated its own quota levels for imports of steel products from 3rd countries, including the EU into the UK.</p>  <p>  Irish importers can continue to import steel from the UK without the additional "Safeguard" tariff of 25% if the volume of imports remains within the EU's quota allocations for the UK.  Imports from the UK to Ireland, or other EU Member States, in excess of these quotas will attract a 25% tariff. Similarly, imports of steel from other 3rd countries into Ireland would also be subject to a 25% tariff if the exporting country exceeds the available quota. Importantly, however, Irish importers can continue to import steel from the rest of the EU as part of the Single Market where no tariffs or quotas apply.</p>  <p>  In applying the Safeguard Measures, the European Commission has undertaken 2 reviews of the Measures, with the most recent review conducted in June 2020. The findings of that review included details on the availability of quotas for each product category. The Commission's review found that in the last quarter of year-2 of the measures (i.e. April - June 2020), a significant level of quotas remained unused, with quotas available in      every product category.  Furthermore the review noted that as of 15 May 2020, there were 9      million tonnes, or 29% of the total quotas, available for use in year-2      of the Measures ('year-3' of the Measures began in July 2020). This would indicate that the application of the EU's Safeguard Measures does not affect the availability of supply, as quotas are not exhausted before the end of a given period. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Commission has previously stated that the imposition of Safeguard Measures are not designed to unduly restrict trade flows but are instead designed to allow a level of imports proportionate to the needs of the Union market. This principle remains in place, now that the United Kingdom is a 3rd country in relation to the application of the EU's Safeguard Measures. </p>  <p>  Finally, neither my Department, nor any of our Enterprise Agencies, is aware of any supply concerns by industry regarding imports of steel into Ireland. The quotas available for steel reflect traditional levels of trade in steel and the Commission's evidence suggests that the quotas are not being exhausted. Conversely, demand for steel has declined as a result of COVID-19, with the Commission and industry advising that it could be 2022 before demand returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. This would suggest that the imposition of Safeguard Measures should not result in any supply issues for industry.</p>  <p>Finally, officials in my Department will continue to monitor the situation and they remain actively engaged with the Commission on the matter including the interplay between the Measures and the Northern Ireland Protocol with the view of finalising how Measures should operate and apply in respect of Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

The legal agreement with each approved lender has a portfolio trigger percentage, increasing over time, which specifies the expected scheme deployment rate.

The deployment rate of the lenders' scheme allocation is monitored on a quarterly basis, and reallocation of existing capacity will be undertaken if the trigger point for any lender is reached.  </p></reply>

We are providing for an extension of the tax warehousing scheme to include repayments of Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme funds owed by employers and preliminary tax obligations for adversely affected businesses. </p>  <p>  To ensure that all self-employed taxpayers can benefit from the losses provision introduced in the July Stimulus, we are also providing that debt warehousing provisions be extended to include the 2019 balance and 2020 preliminary tax to allow such taxpayers to defer payment for a period of a year with no interest applying. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance is also delivering on the Programme for Government commitment to equalise the Earned Income Credit with the PAYE credit by raising it by &euro;150 to &euro;1,650. </p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to the July Stimulus of enterprise measures, which includes the Wage Subsidy Scheme extended through 2021, the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst second line support businesses.  COVID-19 Business Loans up to &euro;25,000 are available through Microfinance Ireland. The loans can range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000. </p>  <p>  Bord Bia is providing a range of supports for impacted food business, including an information hub; training supports; and the introduction of the &euro;1m COVID-19 Response Marketing Package for businesses to accelerate eCommerce and expand marketing activities in the context of rapidly changing trading conditions. Bord Bia continues to support quality assured Irish produce through promotion campaigns and is also supporting food companies to re-orient their produce to meet the needs of retail customers, and to explore any import substitution opportunities.

However, site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies.  2020 has presented undeniable challenges to our ongoing efforts to sustain and grow foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland. The introduction of travel restrictions around the world disrupted the usual way the IDA engages with investors, resulting in fewer numbers of site visits and client meetings. The pandemic has also impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.</p><p>In response to COVID-19, IDA Ireland migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities onto digital platforms and has established a suite of digital content which can be accessed by potential investors.  The Agency has developed this further and has put in place an E-Site Visit experience for potential investors.  The use of digital platforms by IDA staff has contributed to an enhanced digital engagement with existing clients and in hosting E-Site visits with potential new investors.</p><p>The table below details the number of IDA site visits per county during 2020<b></b>These figures capture the total visits per County taking place with potential new investors.

The EWSS is of particular assistance to those businesses who continue to trade, as it should help to cover a large portion of the variable costs the business incurs by opening.</p>  <p>  Alongside the wage subsidy schemes are other concessions which have been granted over the past year, including waivers of commercial rates by the Department of Housing, Local Government  and Heritage and the warehousing of tax liabilities by my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>  In terms of direct grants, many businesses, including those who remained open but who have suffered declines in turnover of 25% or greater were eligible for the Restart and Restart Plus grants from my own Department.  These direct payments complemented a number of other schemes available from my Department, the Enterprise Agencies and the Local Enterprise Offices. </p>  <p>There are businesses for whom additional assistance may be necessary, such as those who are ineligible for CRSS or other schemes.

It is an important mechanism that allows consumers and companies to benefit from a trade agreement at an early stage, as the completion of national ratification procedures across all 27 Member States can take several years.  The full coming into force of the Agreement once ratified across all Member States, will see the implementation of the Investment Chapter of the Agreement including the resolution of disputes between investors and states, should they arise.  </p>  <p>  All international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements.  Where such agreements cover (i) trade in both goods and services and (ii) investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments.  The EU&rsquo;s new approach to investment protection is the Investment Court System (ICS) which is contained in CETA and replaces the old Investor-State Dispute Settlement or ISDS mechanism.  </p>  <p>  ISDS, which has been in existence since the 1950s, enables overseas investors to resolve disputes with the government of the country where their investment is made through binding international arbitration.  ISDS has been included in more than 2,000 investment treaties but has proved controversial in recent times and is now regarded as outdated by the European Commission.  In this regard, the Irish Government considered the European Commission was right to seek to address the concerns raised by NGOs and others regarding ISDS in seeking to develop a new replacement mechanism &ndash; the Investment Court System (ICS) &ndash; to address concerns on transparency, legitimacy and public interest.  ICS is the Investment Dispute Settlement system incorporated in CETA.</p>  <p>  ICS addressees the concerns around the old ISDS system through:</p>  <p>  - Greater transparency &ndash; hearings will be open and comments available on-line, and a right to intervene for parties with an interest in the dispute will be provided;</p>  <p>  - Safeguards to prevent forum-shopping;</p>  <p>  - Provisions for the swift dismissal of frivolous claims should they arise;</p>  <p>  - The maintenance of a clear distinction between international law and domestic law;</p>  <p>  - The avoidance of multiple and parallel proceedings in the ICS and national courts, and;</p>  <p>  - The establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators.</p>  <p>  The reforms to investment protection mean the ICS will involve:</p>  <p>  - a public Investment Court System composed of a first instance Tribunal and an Appeal Tribunal;</p>  <p>  - the establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators with qualifications &ndash; comparable to those required for the members of permanent international courts, from which members will be selected to hear individual cases; and  </p>  <p>  - precise limitations on the ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal.</p>  <p>  Irish companies investing in Canada have only one legal system and one constitutional framework to navigate should they believe they have been discriminated against.  In contrast, Canadian companies investing in Europe are faced with 27 legal systems and constitutions.  The Investment Court System provides a single, consistent mechanism where investors, be they Canadian or European, can seek redress.  </p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada&rsquo;s right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection, meaning measures relating to plain packaging on cigarettes, or minimum alcohol pricing can continue to be introduced.  Further, an investor&rsquo;s loss of profits will not be sufficient grounds for making a claim against a Government.  Any claim must be based on discriminatory and unfair treatment.</p>  <p>  On its own initiative, the European Commission referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) the question of competence as it applied to the EU and the Member States regarding the signing and ratifying of the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (ref 02/15).  The resulting Opinion of the Court, which came after the agreement with Canada had been reached, reinforced our understanding as to where Member State competence rests in relation to certain investment aspects and the attendant obligation on Member States to ratify agreements containing such commitments.  </p>  <p>  In a consequent move aimed at greater transparency, the European Commission adopted a new approach in the case of Agreements with Vietnam and Singapore, separating out the "EU-only" from the "shared competence" elements into two parallel agreements - an exclusively Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and an exclusively Investment Protection Agreement (IPA) respectively.  The IPAs concluded with both countries contain ICS provisions and will each fall to be ratified by all EU Member States in accordance with their national requirements, in due course.  So, ICS continues to be the EU's ambition for IPAs.</p>  <p>  Regarding the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) which was agreed in principle on 30 December 2020, initially, the CAI was intended to contain Investment Protection provisions, however, specific Investment Protection negotiations have not yet been concluded and will now continue on a separate track with the CAI focused on market access opportunities and related matters. However, the EU and China have committed to striving to conclude Investment Protection negotiations within the two years following the signature of the CAI and the EU ambition is for an ICS outcome.   </p>  <p>  The EU is not a party to a third country agreement, but in relation to Mexico I can assure the Deputy that in the modernising of the EU&rsquo;s Association Agreement with Mexico, ICS provisions are included.  </p>  <p>  As far as the EU-UK deal - the TCA - is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that this was very much a &ldquo;bare bones&rdquo; agreement, negotiated in record time and, consequently, omitted many traditional elements of an FTA and left others for further negotiation and settlement.  So I do not think that the TCA can be taken as any sort of exemplar of a model ambitious trade and investment agreement. </p>  <p>  As a small, open economy, Ireland has benefitted immensely from our export orientated enterprises trading across the globe and, therefore, we fully support balanced international trade and the suite of EU Free Trade Agreements that seek to underpin this.  Equally, Ireland has been an attractive destination for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for many decades and participating in EU-Third Country Agreements that address Investment Protection continue to assist marketing Ireland as a competitive FDI-friendly jurisdiction for multinational enterprise to make their investments with the attendant jobs and prosperity that that entails.   </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be recorded that investment disputes can continue to be litigated before national Courts and what ICS offers is an alternative approach for an aggrieved investor. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-03a.116.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021020300059#WRB08600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</p>  <p>  Under Article 7 of the European Union&rsquo;s Energy Efficiency Directive, Member States are required to make a specified amount of energy savings that meet certain criteria defined by the Directive. </p>  <p>  Ireland established an Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme (EEOS) in 2014 in order to achieve a portion of these savings.  An obligation scheme is a regulatory requirement on energy suppliers and distributors to help energy users save energy. This can be achieved by supporting the energy user (financially or otherwise) to implement energy saving practices or to carry out energy upgrades in their property.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s energy efficiency obligation scheme is administered on my behalf by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. The scheme requires suppliers with a market sales volume in Ireland of greater than 600 GWh per annum to achieve savings. The amount of savings each obligated party is required to make is related to their overall market share. The amount of savings to be delivered is as follows: 75% in the non-residential sector, 20% in the residential sector, and 5% among customers in energy poverty. </p>  <p>  Preliminary data indicates that between 2014-2020, the EEOS successfully supported energy efficiency actions in more than 291,000 dwellings and 4,750 businesses, achieving final energy savings of over 3,450 GWh.</p>  <p>  The achievement and average annual energy saving under each sector is:</p>  <p>  - Energy Poor = 74,439[1] properties covered with an average saving of 3,304kWh per dwelling;</p>  <p>  - Residential = 224,2241 properties covered with an average saving of 3,587[2] kWh per dwelling;</p>  <p>  - Non-Residential = 750,000 kWh per site/premises (Non-residential projects have a large range with some below 10,000 kWh and some in excess of 100 GWH).</p>  <p>  SEAI does not collect information from the obligated parties in relation to the cost of delivering savings under the EEOS. However, in 2017 the Commission for Regulation of Utilities published a report indicating that the average cost for electricity and gas suppliers to deliver a kWh of savings under the EEOS was 4.4c per kWh in 2015 and 5.6c per kWh in 2016. As a portion of all gas and electricity sales in those years this is equivalent to between 0.03c and 0.05c per kWh on the bill for commercial and domestic customers if passed on directly. It is up to each obligated party to decide how to fund these savings. Oil companies obligated under the scheme meet their costs through a levy of 0.12c per litre of oil sold. </p>  <p>  Last year, the Department published a paper stating that Ireland would use an obligation scheme again for the period 2021-2030. An interim obligation scheme is now in place for 2021 and a public consultation on the design of the scheme to be implemented from 2022-2030 will be published later this month.  The collection of cost data will be among the topics for consultation.</p>  <p>  [1] Some homes have received support on more than one occasion. Total is just over 291,000 unique dwellings.</p>  <p>  [2] For homeowners meeting the Energy Poor eligibility criteria the costs of the upgrades are fully subsidised for the occupant, whereas the residential occupants are expected to contribute to the costs, allowing deeper measures to be carried out. This explains the higher average saving in residential non-energy poor homes.</p></reply>

I propose to take Questiosn Nos 39 and 40 together.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty was published in 2016. The Strategy set out several actions to alleviate the burden of energy poverty on the most vulnerable in society. The focus of the strategy was on high impact actions which aimed to make a real difference to the lives of those in energy poverty. </p>  <p>  Good progress has been made under the strategy including:</p>  <p>  - Free upgrades were carried out in over 23,000 lower income homes under the main SEAI energy poverty schemes; </p>  <p>  - A consultation on energy efficiency in the rented sector has also been completed which has informed changes to energy efficiency grant schemes with further recommendations to follow later this year;</p>  <p>  - Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically over the period from &euro;15 million in 2015 to over &euro;109 million for 2021. </p>  <p>  - The allocations for retrofit of social housing have also increased significantly with an allocation of &euro;65 million for 2021. </p>  <p>  At the time of its launch, the Strategy was accompanied by a report on the level and extent of energy poverty in Ireland. This study looked at what the typical household has to spend on energy to keep their home heated and compared that to household income. This report found that in 2016, 28% of households in Ireland could be in or at risk of energy poverty.  The ERSI published reports in 2019 and 2020 which calculated the current level of energy poverty. In 2020 the ESRI calculated that the proportion in or at risk of energy poverty had reduced from 28% to 17.5%. These rates align closely to the level of basic deprivation experienced in Ireland.  A separate ESRI study suggested that energy poverty is primarily a function of inadequate resources to cover living costs rather than simply an energy issue.  In addition under the Survey on Income and Living Conditions, the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, has fallen from 9% in 2015 to 4.9% in 2019.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform publishes an annual Public Service Performance Report. My Department provides input to this report annually in relation to the number of lower income households supported to improve their energy efficiency. The Department of Social Protection also provides input in relation to the number of households in receipt of income supports and the impact on the rate of poverty.  The Report is submitted to Government for information and is published on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.   </p>  <p>  Looking forward, the Programme for Government commits to providing &euro;5 billion to part fund a socially progressive national retrofit programme targeting all homes but with a particular focus on the Midlands region and on social and lower income tenancies.  This is in addition to &euro;3.7 billion to support our retrofit targets in the National Development Plan.  &euro;109 million in exchequer funding has been provided tis year to support lower income households to retrofit their homes.  This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation for energy poverty schemes and means that almost half of the total residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. Recommendations aimed at improving the targeting of energy poverty schemes at those most in need will be finalised soon. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to ensuring that increases in the carbon tax are progressive by spending &euro;3 billion on targeted social welfare and other initiatives to prevent fuel poverty and ensure a just transition.  As part of Budget 2021 the Fuel Allowance will increase by &euro;3.50 to &euro;28 per week.    </p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed this year.  Alleviating energy poverty will also be a key consideration for the National Retrofit Plan which will be published this year.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. </p>  <p>  NBI has established a dedicated team to investigate acceleration of the rollout from its current contracted schedule of seven years. All possible alternative network providers are being considered and substantial work has been completed by this team to date with further actions scheduled over the coming months. Part of this work includes an assessment of the potential to utilise the ESB Network for certain areas and this work is on-going. The technical feasibility of whether the ESB network is compatible with the NBI solution has been the primary focus and NBI has undertaken site surveys and developed a detailed design for a pilot area using the ESB network, with the aim of establishing from this pilot exercise, the feasibility of using the ESB infrastructure on a broader basis.</p>  <p>  Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

Despite the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, NBI has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan. I am advised by NBI that, as of 22 January 2021, over 166,000 premises across 26 counties have been surveyed. The first fibre to the home connections are successfully connected and in a test and trial phase in Carrigaline, Co Cork and Cavan. Technical testing and validation will be undertaken prior to a wider release of the areas. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 22 January 2021, 255 sites have been installed by NBI. In addition, school BCPs will be provided with high speed broadband for educational use through this initiative. An acceleration of this aspect of the project was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.</p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays on delivery of aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors with restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally), as welll as the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale, up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. </p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. Budget 2021 provided &euro;109 million in capital funding to support lower income households to retrofit their homes with &euro;100 million of this funding allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme. This represents a &euro;47 million increase on the 2020 allocation and is the highest ever budget for this scheme.The scheme is currently available to households in receipt of:</p><p>- Fuel allowance under the National Fuel Scheme; </p><p>- Job Seekers Allowance for more than six months (and having children under 7); </p><p>- Family Income Supplement;</p><p>- One-Parent Family Payment;</p><p>- Domiciliary Care Allowance;</p><p>- Carer&rsquo;s Allowance where you live with the person you are caring for.</p><p>The eligibility criteria for the scheme were selected in order to maximise the impact of the resources available to the scheme. They are kept under ongoing review with the Department of Social Protection (DSP) to ensure they are consistent with and complementary to the other income support schemes offered by that Department. It is important to note that households in receipt of other DSP allowances may also qualify for a fuel allowance payment. The fuel allowance is means tested and is therefore aligned to the income of the household. </p><p>Funding is also available for people who do not qualify for the Warmer Homes scheme. Budget 2021 provided &euro;112.5 million in capital funding for the other SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes. These schemes can cover a portion of the cost of energy upgrades. </p><p>My Department is engaging with the relevant Government Departments and agencies in relation to measures that could further reduce the financing cost of retrofit for homeowners.  There is also engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on funding requirements as part of the NDP review.  </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that there are other grants and schemes available from Government if there is an urgent need. These include the Department of Social Protection Urgent Needs Payment available through the Community Welfare Service at local DSP offices and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage Aid for Older People Grant Scheme which is administered by the Local Authorities.</p></reply>

The SEAI retrofit schemes offer partial grants for individuals who can afford to contribute to the cost of upgrades as well as free energy efficiency improvements for people at risk of energy poverty.  Guidelines for each scheme is available on the SEAI website - www.seai.ie.The Warmer Homes Scheme and the Warmth and Wellbeing pilot scheme provide a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to lower income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  The types of energy efficiency upgrade recommended for a home is determined by an SEAI survey that considers factors including the age, size, type and condition of the property. There is no maximum value associated with these upgrades but the  measures available and the conditions for recommendation are published in the scheme guidelines.  Risk and complexity are taken into account when assessing each home and recommending particular interventions.</p><p>The Better Energy Homes scheme aims to improve energy efficiency by providing grant support for energy efficiency upgrades to homeowners. Fixed amounts are available for a range of measures. The maximum that a home can receive in grant funding through this scheme is currently &euro;12,450. </p><p>Under the Solar PV scheme a homeowner can receive a maximum of &euro;3,000 towards the cost of Solar PV and battery storage.</p><p>The Community Energy Grant scheme funds community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area - homes, including those at risk of energy poverty, community facilities and businesses.  The maximum grant per house depends on the home type as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Home type</th>       <th>Percentage</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Private energy poor</td>       <td>Up to 80%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Private non-energy poor</td>       <td>Up to 35%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local authority homes</td>       <td>Up to 35%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Private rented homes</td>       <td>Up to 35%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Housing Association homes</td>       <td>Up to 50%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The National Retrofit (One Stop Shop Development) scheme is designed to encourage the development of one-stop-shops for retrofit and to engage groups of private households, registered housing associations/Approved Housing Bodies and Local Authorities that wish to participate in delivering energy efficiency upgrades, specifically in domestic buildings.  The scheme will facilitate larger, more efficient aggregated projects and will bring benefits for homeowners and the supply chain.  The maximum grant per house depends on the home type as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Home type</th>       <th>Percentage</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Private </td>       <td>Up to 35%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local authority homes</td>       <td>Up to 35%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Housing Association homes</td>       <td>Up to 50%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Private non energy poor (Midlands strand)</td>       <td>Up to 35%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Private energy poor (Midlands strand)</td>       <td>Up to 80%</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

It is proposed as a 575km long (500km subsea), 700MW cable from the north-west coast of France to the south coast of Ireland. At this scale it would be able to provide electricity for some 450,000 homes.    The Celtic Interconnector will provide a reliable high-capacity electricity link between Ireland and France that will have significant benefits for the people of Ireland. The project will provide access to the European internal energy market, leading to expected increased competition and lower prices in Ireland.  It will also enhance security of electricity supply and facilitate increased capacity for renewable energy here via export access to the mainland European markets.</p>  <p>  In late 2019 the European Commission announced a grant of &euro;530m towards the construction of the interconnector under the Connecting Europe Facility fund. This grant was made possible by significant support for the project from the Irish Government that resulted in its designation as an EU Project of Common Interest.</p>  <p>  Extensive planning by EirGrid and a period of public consultation took place last year with regard to the development of interconnector infrastructure, following which decisions were reached on the interconnector's location in East Cork.  A further decision was arrived at by EirGrid regarding the establishment of an enhanced community benefit scheme for impacted communities.</p>  <p>  While I have no function in this matter, my officials have been informed that EirGrid will likely submit its planning application for Celtic Interconnector project in Spring this year.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.There are currently over 7,000 homes on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are: </p><p>- currently undergoing works; </p><p>- have been allocated to contractors for works; </p><p>- have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor, </p><p>- or are awaiting the initial survey of their home. </p><p>Eligible homes are allocated on a first come, first served basis, and the average time between application and allocation to a contractor is now 23 months.  The wait time is a result of strong demand for what is an extremely popular scheme.  Wait times were also impacted by changes to the scheme introduced in 2018 which expanded and enhanced the range of energy efficiency measures available as well as an extension of eligibility rules.</p><p>Unfortunately, COVID-19 related restrictions have also impacted waiting times under the scheme. Works are currently suspended in line with the public health measures in place under Level 5 as announced by Government on 6 January.  Works will recommence as soon as the public health advice allows. SEAI's Covid-19 Notice can be found at the following Link: </p><p>Budget 2021 provided &euro;109 million in capital funding to support lower income households to retrofit their homes with &euro;100 million of this funding allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme. This represents a &euro;47 million increase on the 2020 allocation and is the highest ever budget for this scheme.  In addition to the increased budget, capacity by the industry to deliver more activity has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works which commenced at the end of 2020. I also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to allow it drive the various grant programmes that it operates, including the Warmer Homes Scheme, and to ensure that level of activity envisaged under the Programme for Government is delivered. My Department is also in regular contact with the SEAI at official level in relation to the operation of the Scheme. </p><p>Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will also be finalised shortly. </p></reply>

The deployment plan forecasts construction commenced in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.    I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 22 January 2021, over 166,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed including 8,211 in County Tipperary. Surveys have been completed in the surrounding townlands of Aherloe, Ballinalard and Bansha and pre-build works have commenced in these areas. Surveys are progressing in the Roscea area and surrounding townlands and have started in Cashel, Townspark, Boherlahan, Goolds Cross, Knockavilla, Garrenroe, Camus Bridge, Golden, Shanballa, Dogstown, Racecourse Cross, Rosegreen, Knockbrett, Mayfield, Boscobell and Dualla. Further details are available on specific areas within County Tipperary through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 22 January, 255 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. BCP&rsquo;s installed in County Tipperary are Drom Community Centre, Killoscully Community Centre and Killea GAA Club.  BCP sites connected are Moyglass Community Hall, Killurney Community Centre and Aglish Community Centre. Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Poulacapple National School and Killeen National School are installed by NBI and will be connected with high speed broadband for educational use through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Education as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of the schools aspect of the project was announced late last year and will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at https://nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.  </p></reply>

The public transport system in Ireland has played an essential service role over the course of the pandemic, especially in carrying essential workers and others making necessary journeys.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to support continuation of PSO services during the Covid situation in 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the situation of the licenced bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.</p>  <p>  Therefore, last June the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  The Expressway business operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann is one of the many commercial operations of licenced public transport services that have been able to avail of this new, temporary, Covid-related support.</p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis. The NTA on behalf of my Department, entered into contracts with the licensed bus sector to provide funding for routes where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention.  As it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on 26 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. </p>  <p>  As is the case in many other sectors of the economy, despite these Government supports, Covid-19 has resulted in significant financial pressures for public transport operators.  As you will be aware, Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s Expressway business operates on a commercial basis in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licenced bus market.  Following extensive analysis and work within the company, the decision to consolidate its Expressway network was taken by the Board of Bus &Eacute;ireann in September 2020.  This was a commercial decision by the company.  The decision affects four routes:  the Dublin/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020): and services on the Dublin to Cork, Limerick and Galway routes.  </p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement public service obligation (PSO) service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfiguring to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services.</p>  <p>  I understand that Expressway ceased its X12 Limerick/Dublin route with effect from Saturday 30 January 2021.  In light of the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X12 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X12 corridor and have determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route. </p>  <p>  I understand no cessation date has been confirmed by the company for the X8 Cork/Dublin or 20/X20 Galway/Dublin routes and these routes are continuing to operate with the temporary Government funding supports, albeit at a reduced level in line with the reduction in demand.  The NTA will undertake similar examinations in respect of these corridors affected by Expressway&rsquo;s route consolidation process, to ensure there are no gaps in the network, and to assess if there is a need to provide any additional services. This will be done prior to these services ceasing operation.</p>  <p>  On a separate front, the Deputies may also wish to note that, as part of the initiatives introduced in the Government's announcment of a Stimulus Package last July, there will be a significant expansion of PSO bus services in several areas across the country.  Among other things, this will involve the taking on of 120 additional drivers by Bus &Eacute;ireann, and will enable increased bus services in Cork city centre, as well as more frequent services in Navan town, Drogheda, Limerick city, and counties Clare and Tipperary. </p>  <p>  Concerning carbon emissions - a key objective of my Department is to secure an efficient and low emission public transport system. As public transport is responsible for less than 5% of our transport emissions, in absolute terms, converting public transport fleets to low carbon alternatives will have a limited impact on national emission reductions. However, greening the public fleet does fulfil a strong leadership and demonstration role as we shift towards a low-carbon economy. To this end, I am committed to continuing to green the public transport fleet, and to making each public transport journey less carbon-intensive.</p>  <p>The national bus fleet, which carries the majority of public transport passengers, is already moving to lower emission alternatives. During 2020, a total of 280 diesel-electric hybrid buses were ordered, which are plug-in hybrids allowing overnight charging and which have capability of over 2.5 km continuous running in zero emission mode, allowing sections of the routes to operate in this mode.  A number of these vehicles were delivered during December and will enter into service over the coming weeks.  A total of 100 such vehicles should be operational by the end of the first quarter of 2021, with the remaining 180 vehicles to be delivered during quarter 3 and quarter 4 of this year.  </p></reply>

In this regard, this year will see continued support to further enable the roll out of Electric Vehicles and related charging infrastructure. In addition to the continuation of vehicle grants and home and public charging, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) will also be introducing support for destination chargers for locations such as hotels, shopping centres or places of employment while a new EV marketing campaign has been launched by the SEAI to assist citizens in making informed choices on the environmental and economic benefits of driving an electric vehicle. </p>  <p>  In addition, at Budget time, I announced a 2021 allocation of &euro;15 million will support up to 750 taxi and hackney drivers in scrapping their older vehicles and replacing them with zero-emission capable electric alternatives. The scrappage scheme will be open for taxis and hackneys reaching their maximum permissible age limit in 2020/21. Up to &euro;20,000 will be made available for eligible drivers switching to a new all-electric vehicle and up to &euro;32,500 for those moving to a wheelchair accessible full electric vehicle.</p>  <p>   The list of current supports to incentivise the take-up of EVs includes: </p>  <p>  - Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) relief of up to &euro;5,000 for battery electric vehicles and low rates of VRT for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;</p>  <p>  - Up to &euro;5,000 in grant support for the private purchase of a new electric car (M1), and up to &euro;3,800 for the purchase of a new electric van (N1) by a company or where a motor dealership is purchasing a demonstration vehicle;</p>  <p>  - Benefit-in-kind tax relief for battery electric vehicles;</p>  <p>  - Grant support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600;</p>  <p>  - Lowest rate of motor tax (&euro;120 per annum) for battery electric vehicles and generally low rates of motor tax for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles; and</p>  <p>  - A discount on tolls of 50% for battery electric vehicles and 25% for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (up to a maximum amount of &euro;500 per year with greater reductions off-peak on the M50).</p>  <p>It is widely expected that, over the next number of years, the combination of improvements in technology, reductions in vehicle purchase prices, increasing driving ranges and model availabilities from manufacturers, coupled with Government incentives and new investment in the recharging network will maintain the current positive policy environment under which electric vehicle sales have risen steeply in recent years, albeit from a low base.  </p></reply>

This examination is entitled &lsquo;Connecting Ireland&rsquo; and it aims to provide better connections between villages and towns by linking them with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide. </p><p>I am advised that the NTA has now started a three-stage consultation process on its proposals, designed to ensure that meaningful engagement takes place with different stakeholders in transport development at the appropriate stage when developing service revision plans.  Phases 1 and 2 have already started and are running concurrently. They focus on consulting with Local and Regional Authority officials on the main concepts of Connecting Ireland.  Phase 3 which will be a broad consultation with all stakeholders is planned for later in 2021.</p><p>I hope the Deputy can see that there are a number of important strands of work underway in addressing this very important topic.</p></reply>

The recommendations broadly ranged from measures to improve the safety of air travel, to rebuilding regional and international connectivity, and to making financial support measures available to the sector. The current course of COVID-19 means that the short-term prospects for aviation, across Europe and beyond, are bleak. International travel is reduced to only essential journeys, and in that context the aviation sector will be operating at very low levels of activity.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce report was very much focused on how to aid recovery, and while now is not the time to stimulate and encourage recovery, the building blocks for recovery are being put in place for when the public health conditions support the gradual return of non-essential international air travel. Ireland adopted the EU&rsquo;s traffic light system for international travel, which the Report called for, and this, together with the finalisation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Protocol for Safe Air Travel, provided a comprehensive set of rules for international air travel based on clear public health advice.</p>  <p>  A number of financial supports have been made available to the aviation industry, including meeting the Taskforce&rsquo;s recommendations for the extension of the wage subsidy scheme and the provision of liquidity supports. The wage subsidy scheme has been extended into 2021, as has the waiver of commercial rates. Liquidity support for medium and large enterprises has been made available to all sectors, including the aviation sector, through the ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund.</p>  <p>  In November 2020, the Government also agreed a revised &euro;80 million funding package specifically for Irish aviation in recognition of the very difficult circumstances facing the sector. My Department is currently engaging with the European Commission regarding formal approval of this package which will be implemented in line with EU State aid rules.</p>  <p>  The scale of the challenges created by COVID-19 are better understood now than when the Taskforce reported.  While the recommendations of the Taskforce do remain relevant, those relating to recovery and growth of air traffic can only be progressed at the appropriate time, in line with the easing of travel restrictions and improving wider epidemiological conditions.  </p>  <p>  My Department will forward a report to the Deputy in tabular format on the status of imlementation of each of the recommendations.  </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.</p>  <p>  The NDP, as it stands,  does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network, but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be  the maintenance and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects.  Currently the NDP is under review and changes to project criteria could occur.</p>  <p>  Any road improvement project put forward for consideration must be appraised for compliance with the Public Spending Code as revised in December 2019.  An important change to the Public Spending Code is the introduction of a requirement for a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for all projects with an estimated expenditure of &euro;10 million or more.  The SAR is now a key deliverable at the first decision stage in the project appraisal process.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the SAR is to examine the rationale for a proposed project and to ensure the strategic alignment of projects with Government policy, including the National Planning Framework and National Development Plan. The SAR is also an important step in the project lifecycle in that potential alternatives for an intervention are assessed and identified for further appraisal should the project progress to the Preliminary Business Case phase of the appraisal process.</p>  <p>  As regards access to Cobh and Great Island, there was some initial engagement between Cork County Council and this Department in 2019, including a meeting with the  Department's Strategic Research and Analysis Division regarding the project appraisal process. Subsequent to that meeting, Cork County Council decided  to appoint consultants to carry out a wider transport study which will look at all options in relation to access and I understand that the Council expects to appoint those consultants shortly.</p>  <p>  As regards the classification of the R624, the classification of roads as either a national road or a regional road is a Ministerial responsibility under section 10 of the Roads Act, 1993, as amended.  A public road, other than one classified  as a national road or a regional road, is a local road.</p>  <p>  Roads classified as National Primary or National Secondary are funded by the State and construction, improvement and maintenance works are overseen by TII, in conjunction with the relevant local authority, and funded mainly from voted monies.  Roads classified as regional or local roads fall under the responsibility of local authorities. The construction, repair and maintenance of these roads is funded by local authorities&rsquo; own resources supplemented by State grants.</p>  <p>  Requests to classify a road as a national road or regional road are considered, in consultation with TII as appropriate.  Criteria for consideration are numerous and include items such as function of road including access to towns and Cities, major ports and airports, geographical regions, population centres and tourist regions.  It also includes considerations of continuity of classification throughout the length of road, whether roads are feeder connections or links to the national road network, cross section, alignment and structural integrity as well as amount of heavy commercial vehicles.   Funding source for road improvement is not a consideration of classification of road type.</p>  <p>  No decision has been taken to reclassify the R624 as a national road to date. Further consideration may be given to the issue as part of a future general review of road classifications.</p></reply>

This exemption does not apply to the PUP.  Given the differentials in amounts between the two payments, on tax equity grounds I do not consider that s. 126(4)(b) should be extended to the PUP.</p>  <p>  In relation to the matter of increases for qualifying children (IQCs), these payments are exempted under s. 126(2B)  of the TCA.

The payment is made in respect of the employee&rsquo;s regular salary for the days that they are no longer working. For example, where an employee&rsquo;s working week has been reduced from a five-day work pattern to a three-day work pattern, they can receive Short-time Work Support for the other two days.  Short-time work must be systematic and show a clear repetitive pattern of employment. The administration of this support is under the remit of the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The statutory basis for the long-standing exemption from income tax for the Short-Time Work Support is contained in section 126 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides that taxation shall not apply in relation to Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit or Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit (self-employed) paid or payable, to a person employed in short-time employment.  Short-time employment is defined in the Social Welfare Act 2005, as employment in which, for the time being, a number of days is systematically worked in a working week, which is less than the number of days which is normal in a working week in the employment concerned.  Full-time employees who have been placed on a reduced weekly work pattern can apply for the support. Employees must work 3 days per week or less to qualify, having previously been employed on a full time basis.</p>  <p>  Revenue advise me that in situations where an employee&rsquo;s contract of employment sets out that workdays are flexible in nature, then this employment will not meet the definition of &lsquo;short time employment&rsquo;, and the employee will be taxed as normal for the days worked.</p>  <p>  Finally, and as the Deputy may be aware, under Section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, Revenue is precluded by reason of its taxpayer confidentiality obligations, from providing any details in relation to the company in question.</p></reply>

An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. The HTB scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for affordable new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.</p>  <p>  HTB is designed to stimulate the supply of new houses in the housing market and to assist first-time buyers in accumulating a deposit for a new home.  In order to help further meet these goals, I announced an enhancement to the existing scheme with effect from 23 July last for the remainder of 2020 as part of the July Stimulus Package. The legislation that gives effect to this is set out in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020. The Finance Act 2020 further extended the period of application of the enhanced levels of support until 31 December 2021.</p>  <p>  The question of the future of HTB support beyond its current expiry date is a matter that will be considered in due course in the context of Budget 2022 and the subsequent Finance Bill.</p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan.</p><p>Details of CRSS are set out in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at:</p><p>.</p><p>To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on.</p><p>A self-employed travel agent providing services from a home office, which is not customer-facing, will not meet the eligibility criteria.</p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises, such as a camping or caravan site, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria for CRSS. However, Deputies will be aware of the Tourism Business Continuity scheme, a &euro;55m strategic funding scheme announced as part of Budget 2021 to support tourism businesses which was launched earlier this week. I understand that caravan and camping and other outdoor accommodation providers that are registered with F&aacute;ilte Ireland are eligible for phase 1 of this scheme. Further details of the scheme are available on the F&aacute;ilte Ireland website at .</p><p>It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19. The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises, as is currently the case for a business whose trade involves providing non-essential training services to customers at its own business premises.</p><p>Where the trade of a business consists of the provision of health and safety training services at the business premises of a customer, the business would not qualify for CRSS because any reduction in turnover of the business during a period of restrictions would not be because of a restriction on access to the premises of that particular business.</p><p>It is noted that essential health and safety training (that cannot be done remotely) is considered as an essential service and is therefore not subject to restrictions under public health regulations. Therefore, where the trade of a business consists of the provision of essential health and safety training services, that business would not be eligible to claim under CRSS.</p><p>Where the trade of a business consists of a combination of essential and non-essential health and safety training and/ or of non-essential health and safety training carried out at its own business premises and at the business premises of its customers, the business would be eligible to claim under CRSS in respect of that part its trade which relates to health and safety training carried out at its own business premises where the business meets all the eligibility criteria.</p><p>Where a business supplies goods or services to businesses in the hospitality industry which, under the specific terms of the Covid restrictions, are required to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises (for example restaurants), it will not result in the supplier business being eligible to make a claim under CRSS.  Each business must meet the qualification criteria in their own right.</p><p>A charity shop that is not chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D will not qualify for CRSS. This includes a charity shop that has been granted charitable tax exemption status because it is exempt from paying corporation tax or income tax on any income received where the income is used for its main charitable purpose.</p><p>I have no plans to change the eligibility criteria for the CRSS. The CRSS is just one of the Government&rsquo;s supports to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19. Businesses who are not eligible for CRSS may be entitled to alternative supports put in place by the Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme. Businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, excess payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020.</p><p>I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.</p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging Covid-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that borrowers whose payment break has ended are been given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. The latest BPFI payment break update, to 31 December, reported that approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% have not returned to full repayment and are receiving other forms of lender support.</p><p>The Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.</p><p>SME borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME regulations  set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.</p><p>In addition, Credit Review https://www.creditreview.ie was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.</p><p>Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers.</p><p>It should be noted that the Central Credit Register does not produce credit scores; rather the information on a credit report provided by the Central Credit Register is factual in nature and the information is provided to the Central Credit Register by lenders.  It contains no guidance, recommendation or prohibition for lenders on what decision they should make on an application for credit or repayment arrangements agreed with borrowers. Subject to complying with applicable law and regulatory requirements, it is a matter for lenders to make their own lending decisions in accordance with their own credit policies and risk appetites.</p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.</p></reply>

If the political entity is considered to be carrying on a trade, such income may be regarded as part of its trading income and could be taxable. Typically, for activities to constitute trading there should be an element of commerciality and the intention to make a profit.</p>  <p>  Where an individual or a company makes a donation to a political entity and does not receive any goods or services in return, they would generally not be regarded as trading. Where the political entity is not trading, the income from donations would not be taxable. However to the extent that the income from donations is used to generate taxable income any such income will be taxed in the normal manner. Political entities are treated in the same manner under the tax code, regardless of their political orientation.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue does not separately identify or categorise taxpayers based on their political orientation and therefore it is not possible to provide information of the nature sought by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Article 28 of the Mortgage Credit Directive relates to arrears and foreclosure and it was transposed by Regulation 29 of the 2016 Regulations.</p>  <p>  Related to Regulation 29 of the 2016 Regulations, the Bank has in place the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) which was issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989. The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.</p>  <p>  For mortgages that do not fall within the scope of the CCMA, the arrears handling provisions of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the CPC) apply.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-03a.495.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021020300064#WRG06900"><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was legislated for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020. The scheme was an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy.</p>  <p>  The key eligibility criteria for the scheme are that the business is suffering significant negative economic impact due to the pandemic, specifically the employer must demonstrate to Revenue&rsquo;s satisfaction that, by reason of the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent disruption to business, the employer&rsquo;s turnover or business orders will be reduced by at least 25% for the period from 14 March 2020 to 30 June 2020; the employees in respect of whom the wage subsidy is claimed were included on the employer&rsquo;s payroll on 29 February 2020; and the February 2020 payroll submissions were submitted by the employer to Revenue before, in general, 15 March 2020 but recently extended, by concession, to 1 April 2020.</p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) was legislated for under the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020. The scheme is an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and to deliver an enterprise support to employers based on business eligibility delivering a per-head subsidy on a flat rate basis.</p>  <p>  As regards eligibility for the scheme, an employer must be able to demonstrate that his or her business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 January and 30 June 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, the employer must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance throughout the scheme.</p>  <p>  The operation of both the TWSS and EWSS schemes relies on employers to determine their own eligibility. Satisfaction of the eligibility criteria is fundamentally a question of fact. Accordingly, there is no formal appeal mechanism as such provided in relation to this in the legislation. However, in the absence of such a mechanism, Revenue has taken a reasonable and pragmatic approach to the issue of disputes whereby, via their customer complaints procedures, aggrieved businesses can engage with Revenue on the matter by providing supporting evidence and submissions setting out their rationale for inclusion in the TWSS or EWSS as appropriate.</p>  <p>  In the interests of completeness, I should point out that the legislation does provide that certain &lsquo;right of appeal&rsquo; provisions contained in Part 40A of the Taxes Consolidated Act, 1997 shall, in so far as they are applicable, apply where an assessment is raised by Revenue for the collection and recovery of relevant tax related to the TWSS and EWSS.</p></reply>

Records should be maintained to show that the employer has prohibited its use and no such use has occurred, e.g. communication from employer, photographic evidence of odometer etc.</p><p><b>(c) Employer Allows Private Use</b></p><p>Where an employee has a car provided by his/her employer and</p><p>- the circumstances in the previous example don&rsquo;t apply;</p><p>- limited or reduced business mileage (if any) is undertaken during the period of the COVID-19 crisis; and</p><p>- personal use is limited</p><p>the amount of business mileage travelled in January 2020 may be used as a base month for the purposes of calculating the amount of BIK due. Thus, the percentage applied in the calculation of the cash equivalent, which is based on annualised business mileage, may have regard to the actual business mileage for January 2020, for the period of the COVID-19 restrictions. Appropriate records should be kept, e.g. business mileage travelled in January 2020, amount of private use, photographic evidence of odometer etc.</p><p>Where an employee did not have any business mileage for their current role in January 2020, for example where an employee has taken on a new role since that time, a reasonable alternative may be used to calculate the annualised business mileage for 2021. The reasonable alternative used should have due regard to the specific role carried out by the employee, and the business travel the employee would likely be expected to undertake in the absence of any COVID-19 related travel restrictions.</p><p><b>Employee Continues Working</b></p><p>Where an employee continues to undertake business travel as usual in an employer-provided vehicle, the usual BIK rules will apply. Further information on the taxation of employer-provided vehicles is available on Revenue's website.</p><p>Guidance on the above, and many other matters pertaining to COVID-19, can be found on Revenue's website.</p></reply>

The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code (the Code) sets out a number of requirements for banks when amending or altering their services.</p>  <p>  Provision 3.10 of the Code requires banks amending their services to give notice to affected consumers at least one month in advance of the amendment being introduced. This should include details of where customers can continue to access such services. The Code also contains a requirement in Provision 2.11 that a regulated firm must not, through its policies, procedures, or working practice, prevent access to basic financial services. This provision aims to ensure that vulnerable people can gain access to mainstream financial services.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank expects that all regulated firms take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests, particularly in dealings with vulnerable consumers. People who may be experiencing particular vulnerabilities, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19, must be provided with whatever reasonable arrangements and/or assistance they need in dealings with regulated entities.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that COVID-19 has accelerated an increase in the use of digital and card payments and measures have been introduced to ensure that consumers can use digital and card payments where necessary. For example, contactless payments can now be made up to a value of &euro;50 so that consumers have an increased choice in payment methods and less reliance on cash. Where a retailer does not accept a certain form of payment instrument, they must display so clearly at the entrance to their establishment or at the till.</p>  <p>  However, cash still plays a vital part in the Irish payment system and where ATM facilities are unavailable, I would encourage consumers to avail of alternative methods to obtain cash if necessary, such as cashback facilities and withdrawal and lodgement services offered by An Post on behalf of some of the retail banks.</p></reply>

The issue raised in the question is complex as there are a variety of government Covid 19-related supports, some of which may not be covered under any business interruption policy. The Deputy will also appreciate that while, I cannot adjudicate on specific cases, it is my view that where it is established that a liability exists, insurers have a contractual obligation which should be discharged in a timely manner. Where businesses have received eligible government supports, these need to be accounted for in the usual manner.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that both Minister of State Fleming and I have had considerable engagement with the insurance industry on the issue of business interruption claims over the past year. The position outlined above is consistent with our view that as a general rule, insurers should engage with those impacted businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour the terms of the policy cover, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code. Separately, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Business Interruption Insurance Supervisory Framework sets out its expectations of insurance firms in handling COVID-19 related business interruption insurance claims.</p>  <p>  Working to protect customers during and after the COVID-19 crisis, with particular emphasis on business disruption insurance, is a priority issue for Government. This is reflected in the Programme for Government and the recently launched Action Plan for Insurance Reform. The Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will raise this issue with Insurance Ireland and we will engage appropriately with both insurers and the Central Bank on this matter.</p></reply>

The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, subsidy payments of almost &euro;2 billion have been made and PRSI relief worth over &euro;300m granted to over 44,500 employers in respect of over 500,000 employees.</p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS. It is noted that the legislation implementing the measure provides that it will be in place until 31 March 2021, but also provides that the scheme may be extended until the end of June 2021, should it be required.</p>  <p>  It is likely that continued support will be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment and to provide businesses with certainty to the maximum extent possible. Decisions on the form of such support will take account of emerging circumstances and economic conditions as they become clearer.</p>  <p>  In the meantime I am satisfied that the current configuration of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) fully takes account of the changing environment around living with the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19.</p>  <p>  For those businesses who may need additional support at this time, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p></reply>

Further information on the classification process is available on the Revenue website at . Importers having difficulty in determining the product classification code for a particular product should contact the Revenue Tariff Classification Unit through Revenue&rsquo;s secure MyEnquiries service or email: tarclass@revenue.ie for guidance. A detailed description of the product should be included to assist with classification. Power tools is a generic term and is not specific enough to classify the goods and to determine the tariff rate.</p><p>The customs value on which customs duty is calculated is the cost of the goods plus the transport costs (including postage), any insurance fees and any handling charges to deliver the goods to the EU.

As such, it is included within the Programme for Government and the Action Plan for Insurance Reform, launched last December. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, I have consistently called on insurers to treat their customers honestly, fairly and professionally.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that both Minister of State Fleming and I have had extensive engagement with motor insurers and other key policy stakeholders throughout 2020 and these discussions are planned to continue this year. As the Deputy indicates I have called upon insurers to be pro-active and generous in relation to their treatment of motor insurance customers during the COVID-19 crisis. In particular, I would highlight an expected significant reduction in claims arising from the travel restrictions that have been in place. Last year saw a number of insurers announcing a range of forbearance measures and motor insurance rebates for policyholders. Insurers have agreed to further review the situation if Covid-19 restrictions on movement continue to result in sustained lower road usage and claims frequency this year.</p>  <p>  More recently, as part of comprehensive engagement on the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform agenda with a wide range of stakeholder interests, including the main Irish insurers and their representatives, Minister of State Fleming again raised the need for industry to respond to both the Government&rsquo;s ongoing reforms and COVID-19 pandemic. This expectation will be met through lowering premiums, continuing to offer forbearance measures, and by expanding their risk horizon in the market (such as providing more cover for younger drivers.</p>  <p>  While Insurance Ireland last week (27 January) announced a continuance of forbearance measures on behalf of a number of its members, including a number of measures directly targeting motor insurance policyholders, both Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to raise this issue through our ongoing engagement with insurers, particularly in light of the stricter restrictions on movement currently in place as a result of Government measures to combat the pandemic.</p></reply>

Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing TWSS compliance programme is specifically examining that employers adhered to that requirement, as well as examining employer/employee eligibility for the TWSS.</p>  <p>  In order to get much needed income supports into the hands of employees as quickly as possible, Revenue operated a transitional phase of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme until 3 May 2020. This transitional phase of the TWSS provided a subsidy of 70% of the average net weekly pay up to a maximum of &euro;410 in respect of eligible employees.</p>  <p>  On 4 May 2020 Revenue moved to the operational phase of the TWSS, which included increased subsidy rates of up to 85%, subject to certain limits. During this phase of the scheme Revenue ensured that the subsidy refunded to employers was based on each individual employee&rsquo;s Average Revenue Net Weekly Pay (ARNWP), which was derived from an employee&rsquo;s average net earnings in January/February 2020.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that during the operational phase of the TWSS, the calculation of the subsidy payments to employers in respect of its employees based on the average net earnings of each employee during January/February 2020 has optimised the payments to employers for the vast majority of its employees. However, Revenue publicly announced on 8 May 2020 that for a small number of employees who were higher income earners before the COVID 19 pandemic, because of the interaction between their gross and net earnings, an additional subsidy payment may be due.</p>  <p>  Revenue is currently in the process of identifying these employees, with a view to calculating any additional subsidy payment that may be due and will offset this amount against any undercharges of income tax and USC arising on their untaxed TWSS payments. This exercise is being done as part of Revenue&rsquo;s final reconciliation of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.</p>  <p>  Reconciliation involves a comprehensive review by Revenue of the &lsquo;subsidy payable&rsquo; amount for each employee payslip, based on the rules of the TWSS. The total &lsquo;subsidy payable&rsquo; amounts will then be compared to the actual total amount paid to the employer under the scheme to identify any instances where the amounts reimbursed to employers may have been over or under paid. In order to complete the reconciliation process, employers must provide details of the wage subsidy they paid to their employees. To date, Revenue has already received &lsquo;subsidy paid&rsquo; data in respect of 94% of the 6 million payslips that were covered under the TWSS and is actively engaged with those employers who have yet to provide these details. Once all of the required information is available from TWSS reconciliation, the matter of calculating any additional subsidy payments to employees who may have such an entitlement and recalculating the tax and USC liability can be finalised. This process is likely to take several weeks to complete.</p></reply>

The scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020.</p>  <p>  TWSS payments were liable to income tax and USC in the same way as &lsquo;normal&rsquo; wages. This ensures consistent treatment with other workers whose pay was not subsidised by the State, including those in receipt of pay commensurate with the levels of income paid out under the measures such as minimum wage workers.</p>  <p>  However, these liabilities were not deducted from payroll in the usual manner during 2020 and instead became due at year end. This decision was taken in order to maximise the amount of financial support that was provided to recipients at a time when it was considered that they needed such support most.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that some employees in receipt of the TWSS received tax and USC refunds during 2020 because their subsidy payments were not taxed in real-time and the cumulative system of tax deduction calculated that refunds were due to them based on their income and tax deductions at each pay date.</p>  <p>  According to Revenue&rsquo;s records, the person in question had two active employments in 2020, with one employer participating in the TWSS. The person received TWSS payments of &euro;350 per week through this employer for seventeen weeks during the period 2 April 2020 to 30 July 2020. The only exception was for the pay date of 11 June 2020 where the person did not receive a subsidy payment. The person also received varying &lsquo;top-up&rsquo; payments from the employer during the period, which were taxed in real-time through the PAYE system.</p>  <p>  The person submitted his 2020 Income Tax return on 9 January 2021 and, based on the information provided, a final Statement of Liability issued to him on 16 January 2021, confirming an underpayment for the year.</p>  <p>  While Revenue is satisfied that the underpayment calculations are correct, it has confirmed that it will make direct contact with the person to explain how the liability arose. Revenue will also assure the person that the amount will be collected, interest free, over a four-year period beginning in January 2022 by reducing his tax credits for those years.</p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p>  <p>  While many borrowers whose payment break has ended have been able to return to full payments, it is also recognised that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of COVID-19 and they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends or may now be in difficulty for the first time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance. The BPFI has also reiterated this January that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation. It is in the best long term interests of both the borrower and lender that engagement takes place in relation to a particular loan difficulty and that the most appropriate solution to the individual case is adopted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Consumer Protection Code, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience loan difficulty because of COVID-19. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.</p>  <p>  Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements and Central Bank expectations.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.</p></reply>

The scheme was developed at a time when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates, and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, thus far, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.</p>  <p>  Stay and Spend is scheduled to operate until 30 April but the flexibility exists for me to extend its operation in 2021 beyond that date (to end 2021). It is too early as yet to take definitive decisions in that regard. Much will depend on how circumstances unfold in the months ahead. As I have said before, I will keep an eye on how matters develop and the role that the scheme might play and consider if any changes need to be made.</p>  <p>  Since 1 October 2020 when the Stay and Spend scheme commenced, a total of 47,613 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 28 January 2021. The expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;7,652,571 and the potential tax cost is &euro;1,530,514, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important also to recall that Stay and Spend should not be viewed in isolation from the other measures put in place to support businesses generally and the hospitality sector in particular. The VAT change; the rates waiver; the wage support scheme and its application to new or seasonal staff; and other Government measures all play a part in helping the hospitality sector cope with the challenges it faces.</p></reply>

Public bodies are obliged to act in accordance with these rules and accordingly must observe the general principles of EU law including non-discrimination, the free movement of goods and services, equal treatment, and proportionality and transparency in awarding public contracts. They must also ensure that procurement transactions and decisions are fair, equitable and deliver value for money.</p><p>Public procurement procedures require bidders to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts. The criteria upon which contracting authorities may exclude bidders from the award procedure of public contracts are set out in Regulation 57 of S.I. No. 284 of 2016 &ndash; European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulations 2016 on public procurement. The 2016 Regulations contain both compulsory and voluntary grounds for the exclusion of bidders.</p><p>The compulsory grounds for exclusion relate to certain serious offences which are deemed to preclude award of public contracts to a bidder &ndash; at least for a period of time. The compulsory exclusion grounds must be applied at all stages of a procurement procedure. These are:</p><p>- participation in a criminal organisation</p><p>- corruption</p><p>- fraud</p><p>- terrorist offences or offences linked to terrorist activities</p><p>- money laundering or terrorist financing</p><p>- child labour and human-trafficking related offences</p><p>- breach of tax or social security obligations.</p><p>Exclusions can only take place where the bidder or a person who is a member of its administrative, management, or supervisory body, or has powers of representation, decision, or control over it, has been convicted by a final judgment of one of the offences.  When invoking the grounds for exclusion, a contracting authority must have evidence of a sufficiently robust nature to withstand any challenge to that decision.  In the absence of a binding decision or final court judgment, the contracting authority may not be in a position to exclude a bidder.</p><p>Contracting authorities have discretion to disqualify bidders for competing in a public procurement competition for the following reasons:</p><p>- where the contracting authority can demonstrate violations of environmental, social and labour law obligations including rules on accessibility for disabled persons</p><p>- bankruptcy; insolvency or winding-up procedures; assets being administered by liquidator or by the Court; arrangements with creditors</p><p>- where the contracting authority can demonstrate grave professional misconduct</p><p>- where a contracting authority has sufficiently plausible indications to conclude that bidders have entered into agreements with other tenderers aimed at distorting competition</p><p>- poor past performance where the candidate has shown significant or persistent deficiencies in a prior public contract which led to termination, damages or other comparable sanctions</p><p>- where a conflict of interest cannot be remedied by any less intrusive means</p><p>- where a distortion of competition arises from direct or indirect involvement in the preparation of the procurement procedure</p><p>- the bidder has been guilty of serious misinterpretation in supplying information required for the  verification of the absence of Exclusion Grounds or the fulfilment of the Selection Criteria, has withheld such information or is not able to submit supporting documents in relation to the ESPD (European Single Procurement Document)</p><p>- where the bidder has undertaken to unduly influence the decision-making process of the contracting authority or obtained confidential information which may confer upon it undue advantages in the procurement procedure or where the tenderer has  negligently provided misleading information that may have a material  influence on decisions concerning exclusion, selection or award.</p><p>Where there is a conviction on compulsory exclusionary grounds, a bidder is excluded from competing for public contracts for a period of 5 years from the date of the relevant conviction.  Exclusion on the basis of voluntary exclusion grounds is for a period 3 years from the date of the relevant event.  A bidder has the opportunity to provide evidence at tender stage of &ldquo;self-cleaning&rdquo; measures and must not be excluded if such evidence is considered sufficient.  Such evidence could include, for example, payment of compensation in respect of any damage caused, active cooperation with investigating authorities by clarifying the facts and circumstances, implementation of technical, organisational or personnel measures that are appropriate to prevent further misconduct.  The self-cleansing option cannot, however, be extended in the case of exclusion from participation in procurement procedures because of a final court judgment.</p><p>Overall, when submitting a tender, bidders must consider whether any of the exclusion grounds listed in the procurement documents apply to them. Should any of the grounds apply, bidders must advise the contracting authority accordingly. The management of a tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to assess that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process. Contracting authorities may exclude tenderers at any time during the procedures in accordance with the Regulations. In applying discretionary Exclusion Grounds, contracting authorities should pay particular attention to the principle of proportionality.</p></reply>

This is a significant scheme within the Office of Public Works &euro;1 billion flood relief investment programme, from which the relevant funding for the Enniscorthy scheme will be made available, and on completion will protect 236 properties in the town.</p>  <p>  The Scheme requires formal confirmation from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (MPER) to proceed. This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts, which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also requires the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme. This involves, inter alia, a formal review by MPER of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) commissioned by WCC and recently submitted (along with a Natura Impact Statement) to MPER as part of the formal Confirmation process.</p>  <p>  DPER ran the statutory public consultation period required in relation to this process from 28th July to 28th August, 2020. The initial phase of the review of the EIAR and NIS was carried out by consultants engaged for this purpose by DPER, during September and early October. DPER has now forwarded submissions from the public consultation, and the EIAR and NIS reviews, to the OPW, along with a request for supplementary information, pursuant to ADA regulations 2019, to ensure that the design of the scheme complies with relevant environmental directives and regulations. </p>  <p>  The OPW, Wexford County Council, and scheme consultants Mott Mc Donald are currently compiling the supplementary information required, in order to formally respond to the points raised by the review of the scheme by DPER and their consultants.  To this end the OPW has written to DPER indicating that the relevant information will be forwarded by the end of April 2021. DPER and their consultants will then need to review the material submitted with a view to confirming the scheme. It is not possible to provide a specific timeline for a formal decision regarding confirmation in advance of that. </p>  <p>  Completion of the above tasks and the progression of the flood relief scheme is a priority for all parties. In parallel with the confirmation process OPW and Wexford County Council have been working on the following to ensure as efficient progression of the works as possible once the scheme is confirmed; </p>  <p>  - the Foreshore licence application public consultation has been completed, approval expected mid 2021</p>  <p>  - a legal agreement with Irish Water for diversion of services has been agreed. The detailed design for these works is complete, and contractor tender documents are currently being reviewed prior to advertisement.</p>  <p>  - Technical approvals have been received from Irish Rail regarding the rail line crossings, with the legal agreement well advanced</p>  <p>  - Archaeological excavations are ongoing</p>  <p>  - Removal of invasive species (e.g. Japanese Knotweed) are ongoing</p>  <p>  - Pre-qualification of the bridgeworks contractor is almost complete, with a view to expediting contractor appointment post-confirmation.</p></reply>

The Directive provides for a range of measures to establish a common set of minimum standards for the protection of persons who report breaches of EU law across all Member States. </p>  <p>  Ireland already has comprehensive whistleblower protection laws in place in the form of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. Transposition of the Directive will require a number of amendments to be made to the Act.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on those areas of the Directive where Ireland has discretion as regards implementation was conducted in June and July 2020, which was notified using the gov.ie public consultations page, through targeted invitations to relevant stakeholders and via notice in the national press. In all, 24 submissions were received to this consultation from a wide cross section of national and international sources, including advocacy groups, professional organisations, academics and whistleblowers. These submissions have been published on the public consultation page on gov.ie. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to consult with stakeholders on a number of matters related to the transposition of the Directive and always welcomes any further submissions or feedback on this topic from interested parties. </p>  <p>  I hope to bring the text of a draft general scheme of the legislation to transpose the Directive to Cabinet for approval in the coming weeks. The provision for Pre-legislative scrutiny has been made in the Legislative Programme for the Spring Session. I intend to complete the transposition of the Directive in advance of the deadline of 17 December 2021. </p></reply>

Of particular relevance to the tourism sector were the following measures: </p>  <p>- There was a record level of funding for Tourism overall, an increase of &euro;59 million over 2020 allocation, to just under &euro;221 million. </p>  <p>- Based on this allocation, a &euro;55 million business continuity scheme was launched on 1st February by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to help strategic tourism business survive the pandemic and drive recovery. The Scheme will contribute to the fixed costs of identified tourism businesses that are not eligible for CRSS to support their survival.  It will provide an equitable level of payment to the CRSS for qualifying businesses and the first phase which was launched on 1st February will cover businesses such as tourism attractions, activity providers, and caravan and camping sites.</p>  <p>- The VAT rate for the Sector was reduced to 9% to help improve competitiveness and viability of businesses. </p>  <p>- Two separate funds of &euro;10million each were introduced for Coach Tourism Operators and Ireland Based Inbound Agents Business Continuity Scheme in the last quarter of 2020.  </p>  <p>- Funding of &euro;5 million has also been provided for upskilling training and to improve digital presence.</p>  <p>- A &euro;26m adaptation fund for the tourism sector to adapt their premises to meet COVID-19 safety requirements. </p>  <p>In addition, the Government has introduced a number of horizontal measures that have been of assistance to the tourism sector including the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), tax warehousing, and the Commercial Rates waiver, which was recently extended to the end of Q1 2021.  In regard to the CRSS, as at 28 January 2021, Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; data shows that &euro;244m was paid out under CRSS, of which approximately 64% (&euro;155m) related to Tourism and Hospitality businesses. </p>  <p>  The measures introduced have been critical in assisting tourism businesses to survive the hugely challenging situation brought about by the pandemic.

The Taskforce presented its Tourism Recovery Plan 2020-2023 to me on 30th September last. I met with the Taskforce members at their final meeting on October 7th to thank them for the huge amount of work they had put into creating the Tourism Recovery Plan. The Plan produced by the Taskforce was a very useful and important consideration for myself and my colleagues in Government in our deliberations for Budget 2021 and this continues to be the case as we evaluate the evolving situation. </p><p>One of the recommendations in the Recovery Plan was to establish an independently chaired Recovery Oversight Group, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the Taskforce report and monitor the sector&rsquo;s recovery from the Covid-19 crisis. I appointed the Recovery Oversight Group in December 2020 and the group comprises tourism industry practitioners, a transport policy expert, along with the CEO&rsquo;s of the tourism agencies and a Departmental representative. The Group will keep me apprised of progress on the implementation of the Recovery Plan and the recovery of the sector. The Recovery Oversight Group has met twice to date and I attended the Group's first meeting on the 7th December.</p><p>  The Recovery Plan makes a number of recommendations with the priority recommendations relating to the survival of the sector. Good progress has been made in introducing the following tourism-specific measures:</p><p>- There was a record level of funding for Tourism overall, an increase of &euro;59 million over 2020 allocation, to just under &euro;221 million. </p><p>- A &euro;55 million business continuity scheme was introduced to help strategic tourism business survive the pandemic and drive recovery.  </p><p>- The VAT rate for the Sector was reduced to 9% to help improve competitiveness and viability of businesses. </p><p>- A &euro;10million Ireland Based Inbound Agents Business Continuity Scheme opened for applications in November.</p><p>- Funding of &euro;5 million has also been provided for upskilling training and to improve digital presence.</p><p>In addition, there have also been very positive developments with regard to horizontal measures introduced or amended by Government which relate to the recommendations in the Recovery Plan:</p><p>- The EWSS will continue in some form for all of 2021 and the EWSS rates will be aligned with the rates of payment under PUP, up to &euro;350 per week, until 31 March 2021.</p><p>- The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) was introduced, providing for turnover-based payments of up to &euro;5,000 per week where businesses are significantly impacted or closed due to public health restrictions. As at 28 January 2021, Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; data shows that &euro;244m was paid out under CRSS, of which approximately 64% (&euro;155m) related to Tourism and Hospitality.</p><p>- The Commercial Rates Waiver was extended to the end of Q1 2021.</p><p>The measures introduced have been critical in assisting tourism businesses to survive the hugely challenging situation brought about by the pandemic which is ongoing.</p><p>Unfortunately, the evolution of the pandemic in Ireland and elsewhere has meant that our tourism sector has remained in survival mode. Many of the remaining recommendations of the Recovery Plan are aimed at the stabilisation and recovery phase. I, along with my colleagues in Government, will keep these under review as we emerge from the survival phase and move towards recovery and look forward to the input of the Recovery Oversight Group to inform my deliberations in this regard.</p></reply>

The primary objective of the Act is to ensure the improved provision of public services through the Irish language. </p><p>The Act as it currently stands provides for the delivery of public services in Irish in three ways:</p><p>- through provisions of the Act which are applicable to all public bodies under the Act;</p><p>- through regulations made by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media which again are applicable to all public bodies under the Act; and,</p><p>- through language schemes which are agreed with individual public bodies and which provide for an increase over time in the number and standard of services provided in Irish by these public bodies. </p><p>The Office of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga was established under the Act in 2004. The primary functions of the Office are to monitor compliance by public bodies with the provisions of the Act and to take appropriate measures to ensure such compliance.</p><p>The Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2019, as referenced by the Deputy, was published in December 2019. The primary purpose of the Bill is to amend the Official Languages Act 2003 with a view to increasing and improving the provision of public services through the Irish language. Central to these efforts will be a series of provisions which aim to increase the number of Irish speakers recruited to the public service. </p><p>Committee Stage for the Official Languages Bill (Amendment) 2019 commenced on Friday 22</p><p>January and has still to be completed.</p><p>The Bill allows for a statutory Irish Languages Services Advisory Committee to be established to increase and improve the provision of public services through the Irish language. It is proposed that the Advisory Committee be established no later than six months after the Bill has been enacted. The functions of the Advisory Committee are laid out in the Bill and include the publication of a National Plan with the aim of increasing the amount of public services provided through the medium of Irish. It is proposed that the National Plan be prepared and provided to the Minister no later than two years after the Committee's establishment.  </p><p>This Bill provides for an overall objective of 20% of all new recruits in the public service being competent in the Irish language. It is now proposed that this be achieved no later than 2030. </p><p>Furthermore, it is proposed that the Language Commissioner will have additional powers in order to monitor provisions in other enactments relating to the use or status of the official language and to provide commentaries in the way that he or she sees fit. </p><p>The enactment of this Bill will help to strengthen the Irish language in the public sector so that high quality Irish language services will be available to the Irish speaking and Gaeltacht communities. </p></reply>

This Bill provides for: </p>  <p>  - An affordable purchase scheme for the delivery of housing by local authorities;</p>  <p>  - A new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private lands;</p>  <p>  - Introducing a new form of tenure in Cost Rental - this will see the first homes delivered in 2021 where rents will be at least 25% below market rates.</p>  <p>  Of note, the report mentioned above welcomes the Government&rsquo;s shared equity scheme as a measure to help bridge the affordability gap highlighted in the report. </p>  <p>  In terms of measures to improve viability and affordability more broadly, I am mindful of the need to efficiently manage and utilise state-owned lands.  As such, the Government intendeds to legislate to establish the Land Development Agency (LDA) on a statutory basis as a matter of urgency.  The LDA will be tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, state agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase.</p></reply>

Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  </p><p>Local authorities report to my Department on numbers of overall inspections carried out and enforcement actions undertaken on a quarterly basis. The most recent data received in respect of the number of inspections of all private rental properties and those with HAP tenancies is set out in the table below. <table>    <tr>       <th>HAP Inspections carried out in 2019</th>       <th>Total Inspections   carried out in 2019</th>       <th>HAP On-site Inspections   carried out Q1-3 2020</th>       <th>Total On-site Inspections carried out in Q1-3 2020</th>       <th>HAP Virtual Inspections carried out in Q1-3 2020</th>       <th>Total Virtual Inspections carried out in Q1-3 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>23,419</td>       <td>40,988</td>       <td>9,663</td>       <td>19,524</td>       <td>501</td>       <td>755</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, Covid-19 pandemic restrictions have impacted on the inspection of all rented dwellings - including those with HAP tenancies.  The City and County Management Association&rsquo;s Local Authority Resilience and Recovery Plan for living with Covid-19 (October 2020) and its subsequent Local Authority Services Framework for Future Covid-19 Pandemic Response (January 2021) do not permit rental inspections in Levels 4 and 5.  This is in order to protect tenants, landlords and rental inspectors.</p><p>In response to the difficulties caused by pandemic restrictions, some local authorities have been piloting virtual inspections.  Dublin City Council has led this initiative which entails landlords receiving a checklist for self-assessment and being required to submit photographic/video evidence by email, tenants being invited to raise any non-compliance issues they are aware of and being asked to confirm that any remedial works requested by the local authority have been completed, and the Council reserving the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to do so.</p><p>While virtual inspection systems present certain challenges and limitations, they do offer a way of improving the standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic. I support these initiatives and my Department is encouraging local authorities not involved in the pilots to consider adopting them. I have committed to providing Exchequer funding for those that do.</p></reply>

The Guidelines are available on the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage website at  </p><p>Specific Planning Policy Requirement 9 (SPPR 9) provides as follows:</p><p>There shall be a presumption against granting planning permission for shared accommodation/co-living development unless the proposed development is either:-</p><p>(i) required to meet specific demand identified by a local planning authority further to a Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) process;</p><p>or,</p><p>(ii) on the date of publication of these updated Guidelines, a valid planning application to a planning authority, appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, or strategic housing development (SHD) planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in which case the application or appeal may be determined on its merits.</p><p>In conclusion, SPPR 9 includes provision for an exceptional case where a local authority identifies a specific need for shared accommodation/co-living development, further to a HNDA process.  This is a matter for individual local authorities to determine.  My Department will continue to monitor the emerging shared accommodation/co-living sector and in particular the delivery of any permitted developments.</p></reply>

Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 sets out the purposes for which costs may be incurred by housing authorities in respect of the provision of homeless accommodation and related services.</p>  <p>  All emergency accommodation, whether provided by local authorities, NGOs, voluntary bodies or privately are required to comply with standards and these standards are monitored.  The National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) for homeless services is in place nationally for local authority and NGO delivered services.  The Framework was developed to ensure a consistent approach in how local authorities and service providers respond to the needs of those experiencing homelessness and to improve the quality of services provided.   In general, the operation of these emergency accommodation facilities is contracted out by local authorities, under service level agreements, to NGOs involved in the delivery of homeless services.</p>  <p>  Local authorities also carry out inspections on facilities that are not covered under the Framework, as they determine to be appropriate.  This regime operates in parallel with, and is based on, the NQSF arrangements.  The Standards and Facilities Teams in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) oversee all emergency accommodation in the region and seek to ensure that all relevant guidelines, policies and procedures are complied with in order to deliver a safe and comfortable place to stay for service users.  The DRHE has an inspection regime in place to deal with complaints and to ensure accommodation is appropriate and safe. This includes engaging with homeless families and individuals on issues arising in their accommodation.  The DRHE has confirmed that it has a thorough complaints procedure in place, and that each complaint is fully investigated and addressed in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  Separate to the service standards expected of providers via service level agreements, all homeless service providers must meet the requirements of statutory codes, in particular the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Fire Services Acts.</p>  <p>  Procurement of services and awarding of contracts are a matter for individual local authorities who are obliged to ensure compliance with all relevant statutory obligations in respect of provision of services and use of public funds.  Decisions on the need for homeless accommodation including any procurement of services, contractual arrangements and operation and funding of homeless accommodation are a matter for individual authorities.</p></reply>

The Committee&rsquo;s report has since been received and my Department is currently working through the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. The General Scheme, which was published in 2017, is available on my Department's website at the following link: </p><p>The main objective of the proposed legislation is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with Building Regulations within the builder community of the construction sector  The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist contractors is an essential consumer protection measure giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator.  In addition, it will complement the reforms made through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and contribute to the development of an enhanced culture of competence and compliance in the construction sector. </p><p>In response to the building failures that have emerged over the past decade, a three pronged Building Control Reform Agenda focusing primarily on ensuring strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry and on improving compliance in the Building Regulations. The three elements include;</p><p>1. Reform of the Building Control process</p><p>2. Building Control Management Project and establishment of a National Building Control Office</p><p>3. Putting the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing.</p><p>The reform of the Building Control Process and establishment of the National Building Control Office have resulted in clarity on who has held the designated roles and who is responsible for addressing the issues. This facilitates and simplifies the inspection, implementation and enforcement role of Building Control Authority.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%. </p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way.  The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), underpins much of global  biodiversity policy and its 15th Conference of the Parties is due to take place later this year, having been delayed due to the Covid pandemic from its original dates in November 2020. </p>  <p>  The EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, launched by the European Commission in May 2020, proposes that by 2030, member states legally protect at least 30% of the EU&rsquo;s land and marine areas, and that 10% (or one-third of the protected areas) would be strictly protected. This is an overall EU target and discussions around how this will be achieved are still ongoing; fair and transparent burden-sharing among member states is a crucial consideration in discussions around implementation of the Strategy at national level. Nonetheless, the EU Strategy will form the basis of the positions to be adopted by the EU and its Member States at COP15.</p>  <p>  The increased percentage of designated land for protected areas is crucial to the EU Biodiversity Strategy but will require significant buy-in across the EU from agriculture and landowners. This will be one of the key challenges of implementing the Strategy.  The Commission and member states will agree on criteria and guidance for identifying and designating additional areas, as well as further information on definition of protection, later this year. Member states will be obliged to demonstrate significant progress in designating the required new protected areas and integrating ecological corridors by end 2023; on this basis the Commission will assess in 2024 whether new EU legislation or other further actions should be proposed. </p>  <p>  Ireland is at the early stages of developing a network of marine protected areas (that will include SACs and SPAs designated under the Nature Directives). In addition, NPWS and Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are cooperating on exploring the overlaps of the Biodiversity Strategy with the EU "Farm to Fork" policy in agriculture; and more generally, examining the resources and funding which will be needed for restoration, and with regard to implications for farming, forestry, fisheries and the commercial activities associated with implementation of the Strategy. </p>  <p>  The EU Strategy also calls for the updating of National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plans (NBAP) in 2021. Ireland has carried out an interim review of its current NBAP and the process of developing a new NBAP will get underway this year.  The outcome of the COP15 and the agreement of a post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, along with the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and the existing national policy and legislative framework for biodiversity and nature, will underpin the objectives, targets and actions of an ambitious and transformative National Biodiversity Action Plan to carry on the important work that is already underway across government in implementing the current NBAP which runs from 2017 to 2021. </p></reply>

This primarily involved a desktop exercise based on the information available in local authorities.  Though the desktop survey work was limited it did indicate that substantial investment in the local authority housing stock was required  Such investment is being made on an annual basis by my Department under the Energy Efficiency, Voids, Disabled Persons Grants, Regeneration and Remedial Works Schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department is determined to ensure that future improvement works are driven by strategic and targeted work programmes informed by stock condition surveys and therefore have been working with the local authority sector, through the City and County Management Association, to drive a planned maintenance approach to the maintenance of local authority housing stock.  This will see circa 140,000 local authority social housing properties surveyed over a 4/5 year period, commencing in late 2021.  These stock condition surveys will inform future work programmes, funding requirements and allocations.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Acts to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. </p>  <p>  The RTB displays comprehensive information on its website - www.rtb.ie - including guidance and frequently asked questions documents relating to terminating tenancies during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  A landlord may refer a matter to the RTB for dispute resolution services where the tenancy has been registered.  Due to the quasi-judicial nature of work of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to provide legal advice, comment on, or to intervene in the specifics of any individual case.  My Department does not provide legal advice.  A landlord or tenant might wish to seek independent legal advice in a particular case. </p>  <p>  Section 34 of the Acts provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any tenancy termination notice served, and the termination will not be valid unless that reason relates to one of the following:</p>  <p>  -  the tenant has failed to comply with the obligations (other than the obligation to pay rent) of the tenancy;</p>  <p>  -  the tenant has failed to comply with the obligation to pay rent under the tenancy;</p>  <p>  -  the landlord intends to sell the dwelling within the next 9 months;</p>  <p>  -  the dwelling is no longer suited to the needs of the occupying household;</p>  <p>  -  the landlord requires the dwelling for own or family member occupation;</p>  <p>  -  vacant possession is required for substantial refurbishment of the dwelling; and/or </p>  <p>  -  the landlord intends to change the use of the dwelling.</p>  <p>  Notices of termination can be served at this time but a termination cannot take effect until after 15 March 2021 (i.e. 10 days after the lifting of the current 5km restriction on travel from home) under the Residential Tenancies Act 2020, subject to certain exceptions.  For example, a notice of termination with a 7 day notice period can be served in serious cases of anti-social behaviour and can take effect at this time.  Actions to deal with anti-social behaviour, harassment and intimidation are primarily a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be contacted, if necessary, to safeguard property.</p>  <p>  Section 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 provides that where a valid termination notice was served before the commencement of an emergency period (i.e. before 31 December 2020, in the context of the current emergency period), the tenant is entitled to remain in occupation during the emergency period and for 10 days following the expiry of the emergency period (i.e. up to and including 15 March 2021; the emergency period could automatically be extended in line with any extension by the Minister for Health under section 31A Health Regulations to the operation of the 5km travel restriction).  The usual terms and conditions of the tenancy apply during this time. </p>  <p>  Where a tenancy is to be terminated on grounds of rent arrears, newly enhanced protections and procedures now apply for tenants and landlords under Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020. Comprehensive guidance on these measures is also available on www.rtb.ie.</p>  <p>  My Department arranged for a response to issue to the person in question on 28 January.</p></reply>

Generally a single 'call for proposals' will issue early in the year.  A second call may issue later in the year if additional funding is available.</p>  <p>  In 2019, an initial call for proposals issued to local authorities. After a review of the submissions final allocations issued in August 2019. A second round of funding was also made available to local authorities who could complete additional units by the years end.</p>  <p>  In March 2020, a call for proposals for COVID-19 related voids funding was issued to local authorities.  406 homes were returned to productive use as part of this programme with Exchequer funding of &euro;3.7m recouped to local authorities.</p>  <p>  As part of this Governments July Stimulus Package, I secured &euro;40million of additional funding for the Voids programme in 2020 and a call for proposals issued in August.

As part of its work, the Working Group recommended a number of revisions to the existing grant scheme that provided support towards the remediation, repair, or upgrading works to, or the replacement of, domestic waste water treatment systems.  The revised and new regulations that underpin the grant schemes were published in May 2020.</p>  <p>  The Water Services Act 2007, as amended, required all owners of premises served by an individual domestic waste water treatment system to have the system entered into a register maintained by local authorities.  The prescribed date of 1 February 2013 was appointed by the Water Services Act 2007 and 2012 Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems (Registration) Regulations 2012, as amended. New houses with domestic tanks continue to be required to register.</p>  <p>  The strict cut-off date, together with sanctions for non-compliance, was successful ensuring that an estimated 95% of systems were registered.  Amending this provision to allow for retrospective registration would require amendments to primary legislation.  It was not possible to do so as part of the introduction of the revised grant schemes which were effected by regulations.</p>  <p>  In implementing the revised arrangements, my Department has undertaken to conduct a review of the grant schemes after one year of operation to ensure their alignment with policy objectives.  In this context the issue of the registration cut-off date will be considered, noting, of course, that primary legislation would be required to effect such a change.</p></reply>

This provides the legislative basis for a number of new affordable housing measures.  This includes a local authority led affordable purchase scheme and an Affordable Purchase Shared Equity scheme for homes on private developments. </p>  <p>  It is intended that these schemes will be targeted at first-time buyers who are seeking to buy a new home, but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time.  The equity support provided will help them to secure their own home by bridging the gap between the mortgage available to them and the cost of the home that is suitable to meet their needs.  The eligibility criteria for these schemes is being finalised along with other elements of the detailed drafting of the Bill.  However, it is not anticipated that there will be any restriction on eligible households purchasing homes under both affordable schemes from accessing mortgages from retail institutions.</p>  <p>  In relation to the location which is the subject of the question, Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) funding has been made available for six proposed developments in the Cork County administrative area, one of which was for 50 affordable homes on land at Cammogue, Kinsale with funding of just over &euro;2.8m.  This project is being led and managed by Cork County Council.  I understand that the Council is presently undertaking the design of the proposed housing scheme on this site with a view to bringing forward a Part 8 planning application for the development of the site later this year. </p></reply>

All local authorities are receiving and processing RIHL applications and are incorporating increased flexibility to accommodate applicants during the COVID 19 Pandemic. </p>  <p>  As is the case with any lender, local authorities must lend mortgages on a prudent basis, taking into account the most recent income and employment data available.  Importantly, this is both for the protection of the lender and the borrower, in particular to seek to ensure that borrowers are not left with unsustainable debt burdens, as a mortgage is a long-term financial commitment.  It would not be appropriate to lend when there is an identifiable risk that the person&rsquo;s income and ability to pay might not return to the level required to support the borrowing requested.</p>  <p>  Where such persons are approved for a RIHL loan, draw down would not commence until their unsupported income post Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) has returned to the level specified in the original application for a period of time, usually up to three months.  This is line with the requirement to lend prudently. </p>  <p>  This is not a blanket ban and local authorities can use their judgement and knowledge of local employers to advance loans to applicants before the end of this three-month period, where appropriate.  This also applies to the successor scheme the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).  There are further exceptions to this approach.  In the case of a joint application where only one party is on TWSS or EWSS, the application can also proceed to drawdown if repayment capacity can be assured based on the other person&rsquo;s income.  For applicants whose post-TWSS/EWSS income is lower (e.g. due to reduced hours) than stated on their application, their application can be re-assessed to determine the most appropriate borrowing amount for them.</p>  <p>  In addition, persons currently on the TWSS/EWSS can continue to apply for a RIHL mortgage based on their pre-TWSS/EWSS Income.  This will provide clarity to applicants regarding their eligibility for the loan amount and will enable them to commence the property search.</p></reply>

The Government quadrupled funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2020, given its role as lead UN agency for health and co-host of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which has the COVAX facility as a centrepiece.  COVAX is supporting 92 low and middle-income countries access Covid-19 vaccines.</p>  <p>  Vaccine supply constraints remain an issue, particularly for low-income countries.  In response to this, the Irish Aid allocation to global health will increase to at least &euro;50 million in 2021, to include support for global equitable access to vaccines through WHO and the COVAX facility.</p>  <p>  Also included in this is funding of &euro;15 million to the Global Fund to end AIDS, TB and Malaria, and &euro;3 million to Gavi - supporting our partner multilateral agencies, sustaining health systems and ensuring attention to other diseases including HIV and AIDS, Malaria and TB. Ireland also continues to support key partner multilateral agencies, such as UNICEF and multilateral development banks, who are also playing an important part in the global response to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Irish Missions in partner countries will in the meantime be working alongside the WHO and other health partners to support the vaccine roll-out effort, which will face further challenges given limited health systems capacity in many countries.</p></reply>

This is an issue where there could be benefits to moving in step with EU partners, and it is a matter that I discuss regularly with EU colleagues.</p>  <p>  Recognition by Ireland outside the context of an overall peace agreement could, however, affect Ireland&rsquo;s influence on the Israel-Palestine conflict at EU and international level.  Timing and context would affect whether such a loss of influence would be matched by a commensurate benefit for the Palestinian people and a positive impact on the peace process. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to supporting a viable two-State solution, in line with the agreed parameters for a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The matter is discussed regularly at the Security Council.  </p>  <p>  This month, UN Secretary General Guterres appointed a new UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Mr Tor Wennesland.  On 26 January Mr Wennesland provided a briefing to the UN Security Council at the 'Quarterly Open Debate on the Middle East, including the Palestinian question'. </p>  <p>  At this debate, I outlined Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Middle East Peace Process and called for a renewed role for the Middle East Quartet to re-energise the peace process.  I emphasised that Ireland remains ready to support any peace initiative that respects the international parameters for a two-State solution and the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, and which provide a basis to meet the aspirations of both peoples.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to work with international partners on this issue including while we are on the UN Security Council, in particular focusing on the need for the adherence of all parties to the Resolutions which have been adopted by the Council, and our opposition to actions which undermine a viable two State solution. </p></reply>

The Minister continues to engage with regional actors in this regard, including in Addis Ababa, Nairobi and Pretoria, and through our membership of the European Union.</p>  <p>  My Department has provided over &euro;2.6 million to date to support the humanitarian response to the Tigray crisis.  This includes &euro;1.4 million to Irish NGOs within Tigray, &euro;500,000 to the UN refugee agency to support the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, and almost &euro;750,000 towards humanitarian stocks, and supports for the protection of women and girls. </p>  <p>  The crisis in Ethiopia was discussed at the UN Security Council on 24 November and 14 December last year.

It is staffed by officers from the EU Commission, the EU Council Secretariat and the Foreign Ministries of EU Member States, including my Department.  The recruitment of diplomats from Member States to serve in the EEAS enhances the links and interaction with the diplomatic services of the Member States. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government makes a commitment to ensuring that Ireland is adequately represented in EU Institutions, including the EEAS.  To that end, last October, the Minister of State for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, T.D. launched a public consultation on Ireland's EU jobs strategy.  Following this consultation, officials in my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are working together to develop Ireland's overall policy approach to EU staffing.  The strategy will include proposals aimed at increasing the number of Irish diplomats securing positions within the EU Institutions, including the EEAS.  While work on the strategy is ongoing, I hope it will be published in the coming months.</p>  <p>  In the interim, this continues to be an area of focus for my Department in recognition of the value of placing Irish civil servants in key positions to enhance our influence and contribute to the effective functioning of EU institutions.  My Department takes all reasonable steps to support the candidacies of Irish applicants for EEAS posts.  Officers who are offered positions have been, and will continue to be, granted special leave for the duration of their assignments.  Currently, eleven members of staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are on assignment to the EEAS, either at its Headquarters in Brussels or in one of the 140 EU Delegations located across the world.  This includes one at Head of Delegation level and one at Managing Director level.</p></reply>

We reject the democratic legitimacy of the Lukashenko regime and we have condemned in the strongest possible terms the flagrant human rights abuses we have seen take place in Belarus in the run up to, and in the aftermath of, those elections.  The EU has responded with a strong message by imposing sanctions against 88 key figures responsible for the current situation and 7 businesses benefiting and/or supporting the regime.</p>  <p>  The Belarusian people face indiscriminate detention on a daily basis and the authorities appear unwilling to prevent or even investigate credible claims of torture, ill-treatment and abuse by State security forces.  Shamefully, the use of State violence against peaceful protesters has also led to loss of life.  These actions are wholly unacceptable.</p>  <p>  Reporters Without Borders have designated Belarus the most dangerous country in the world for journalists, with detentions of media workers numbering in the several hundreds since the fraudulent election.  We strongly condemn the repression of the Belarusian people and the suppression of their voices through internet shutdowns and curtailments of fundamental freedoms and media freedoms. </p>  <p>  Along with our EU partners, Ireland has been vocal in calling on the Belarusian authorities to release all those unjustly detained, including political prisoners.  We have been clear and consistent in international settings in this regard, including at the Human Rights Council and at meetings of UN Security Council members.  I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to use our voice to press the Belarusian authorities to adhere to their international obligations.</p>  <p>  The future of Belarus is for its people to decide in fresh elections that are free and fair.  The new OSCE Chairperson-in-Office has maintained the offer to facilitate a meaningful national dialogue.  This is the best way to achieve a peaceful and democratic resolution to the crisis and we urge the Belarusian authorities to firmly grasp this opportunity.</p></reply>

Both Ireland and the EU regularly make that position clear and remind other States of their obligations. </p>  <p>  At the most recent meeting of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Executive Committee in October 2020, the EU recognised the importance of safeguarding the principle of non-refoulement.  In my address at the same meeting, I reiterated that defending the norms and commitments enshrined in the 1951 Geneva Conventions remains of paramount importance.</p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2020, the EU commended the efforts made by Lebanon and the Lebanese people to host over 1 million Syrian refugees until such a time when conditions for their safe, voluntary and dignified return in line with the applicable norms of international law and the principle of non-refoulement will be met.  These efforts have been despite Lebanon facing its own challenges including a severe economic crisis, the catastrophic Beirut Port explosion and devastating impacts of COVID-19.  </p>  <p>  I take note of the recent letter from concerned organisations about the situation of Syrian refugees in Lebanon and commend the vital work of civil society organisations in safeguarding the wellbeing and rights of refugees in Lebanon. Ireland has been consistently clear that refugee returns must be voluntary and safe. Addressing the United Nations Security Council on 20 January, Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative to the UN stated that &lsquo;millions of Syrians remain as refugees, and the conditions necessary for them to return, in a safe, voluntary and dignified manner are far from being achieved&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Ireland's response to the Syria crisis has been its largest single response to any humanitarian emergency.

Within Syria itself, more than 11 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, while over five million Syrians are refugees, mainly in neighbouring countries. </p>  <p>  At the most recent meeting of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Executive Committee in October 2020, I reasserted Ireland's continued commitment to resettlement as a vital protection tool and an expression of solidarity to these populations in need. </p>  <p>  In total over 3,000 persons with Syrian nationality have begun new lives in Ireland under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).</p>  <p>  In December 2019, the Government committed to welcoming a further 2900 refugees between 2020 and 2023 through a combination of community sponsorship and resettlement, with a focus on Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon. </p>  <p>  Ireland also supports resettlement and family reunification through core funding to UNHCR and International Organisation for Migration. The IOM is the leading inter-governmental organisation in the field of migration and works closely with governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental partners. Ireland is one of a small group of countries which provides unearmarked core funding support to IOM, giving the Organisation the flexibility to operate where needs are greatest. Our support increased to &euro;1 million in 2020.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the efforts of the efforts of the UNHCR which is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees worldwide and safeguard their rights and well-being. Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to UNHCR for 2020 were over &euro;18.5 million, which includes unearmarked core funding of &euro;9 million, as well as crisis specific responses including the Syria crisis.</p>  <p>  Ireland also welcomes any action by the EU or the United States of America to support resettlement and family reunification. Since 2017, more than 40 per cent of refugees resettled through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have found new homes in Europe. At the Global Refugee Forum in December 2019, EU countries pledged a total of 30,000 resettlement places for 2020. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the practical challenges it has posed for resettlement, the European Commission&rsquo;s new Pact on Migration and Asylum, released in September 2020, proposes to extend both the EU target quota of 30,000 as well as the ad hoc pledges Member States made for 2020 into 2021. </p></reply>

Funding is provided through implementing organisations including non-governmental organisations, UN organisations and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>  <p>  Each of these partners has specific qualities, areas of focus, and comparative advantage that allows us to reach a broad range of recipients. Support through these partners meets the high levels of accountability and strict standards of propriety which are in place for all implementing organisations.</p>  <p>  Our key implementing partners in the Syria region are:</p>  <p>  -  The UN, which is often the lead actor in many major humanitarian crises, has a strong overview of overall needs, and coordinates the various actors involved in the response.</p>  <p>  -  The ICRC, whose speciality is working in conflict, and which is sometimes the only humanitarian actor present in some particularly challenging contexts.</p>  <p>  -  Irish NGOs, whose programmes are both addressing immediate life-saving needs of the most vulnerable communities affected by the Syria crisis and advocating for their protection from human rights abuses. </p>  <p>  Crucially, each of these partners works in close cooperation and partnership with local community organisations. For example, the UN&rsquo;s Syria Cross Border Humanitarian Fund (SCHF), to which Ireland provided &euro;2.5m in 2020, supports recipients that include Syrian and international NGOs, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movements and UN agencies. One of the Fund&rsquo;s key objectives is to maximise engagement with local, national and diaspora Syrian NGOs to ensure better access to the people in need. As a result, over the past few years, the SCHF has grown into a critical funding mechanism for Syrian NGOs with a large part of its funding allocated to local partners.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is a significant contributor to EU humanitarian budgets. Through its annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s response.  The EU has mobilised more than &euro;20 billion since 2012 for assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in the region. Since its establishment in 2014, a significant share of the EU's support for Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries has been provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis. The Fund primarily addresses educational, economic, social and health needs of Syrian refugees, while also supporting overstretched local communities and their administrations.</p></reply>

These statements, among other things, urged China to urgently implement the eight recommendations made by the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination related to Xinjiang, and to uphold its international obligations and respect human rights in Xinjiang. They also called on the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide regular information on the situation in the region, in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms that are guaranteed under international law. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, the EU has raised this matter with Chinese authorities directly on a number of occasions. The deterioration of the human rights situation, including the treatment of minorities in Xinjiang, was raised by EU leaders with China on 14 September, and also during the EU-China Summit on 22 June. </p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and Ireland will continue to monitor and assess the situation and, along with our EU partners, engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora to address our concerns.</p></reply>

In line with these Conclusions, the Government agreed on 13 October to suspend Ireland's Extradition Agreement with Hong Kong.</p>  <p>  This matter was discussed most recently by Member States at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 25 January, where it was agreed to continue with the implementation of the measures outlined in the Council Conclusions. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our EU partners, will continue to monitor the situation and raise our concerns with Chinese and Hong Kong authorities as appropriate. </p></reply>

Building on the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute;, United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 (2015) established a framework for a political solution. </p>  <p>  Under that framework, a UN facilitated but Syrian owned and led Constitutional Committee comprised of representatives of the Syrian Government, opposition and civil society has been meeting in Geneva with the goal of drafting a new Constitution ahead of free and fair elections. Five meetings of the Committee have taken place since the autumn of 2019. </p>  <p>  While we welcome the meetings that have taken place to date, the pace of progress has not been sufficient to meet the expectations of the people of Syria. </p>  <p>  Speaking to the Security Council on 20 January, the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, noted the importance of the latest session commencing on 25 January and said that the time had come for the Committee to begin to move from preparing a constitutional reform to drafting one. He noted the need to unlock progress along the path of resolution 2254 and the dangers to Syria&rsquo;s civilians, to Syria as a state, to its society, and to the region if this does not happen. I fully share this view. </p>  <p>  Ireland calls on all parties to engage urgently and seriously with the work of the Special Envoy, and make sustained progress towards the end of the conflict.</p></reply>

Along with the UN and the EU, Ireland believes that the only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in Yemen is through a negotiated end to the conflict. The UN has been warning for some months of the risk of famine in Yemen, underlining the seriousness of the situation there and the urgency that is needed to address it.</p>  <p>  Ireland is in regular contact with the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which Mr. Lowcock heads, from Dublin as well as through our Missions in Geneva and New York.  We rank as one of the top 20 donors to OCHA&rsquo;s core activities over recent years.  Ireland also provides core funding to the OCHA-managed humanitarian pooled funds - the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and the Yemen Humanitarian Fund.</p>  <p>  Mr. Lowcock briefed the UN Security Council on 14 January when, along with the World Food Programme Executive Director, Mr. David Beasley, he again warned of the threat of famine.  Ireland&rsquo;s Permanent Representative told the Council that, faced with this catastrophe, the international community must spare no effort to ensure protection and humanitarian assistance for the most vulnerable, including internally displaced persons and marginalised groups.</p>  <p>  Given the deteriorating situation, Ireland in December provided an additional &euro;1 million to the Yemen Humanitarian Fund, which is managed by OCHA, because of the urgency and scale of the humanitarian needs in Yemen. In 2020, Ireland provided &euro;6 million in funding to this Yemen Fund, which mobilises and channels funding to NGOs and UN agencies that are best placed to deliver lifesaving assistance to the most vulnerable. In total, Ireland has contributed over &euro;28 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen since 2015.</p>  <p>  Ireland also provides significant humanitarian funding at the global level, including to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). In 2020, the CERF provided almost &euro;54 million in funding to Yemen. As an EU Member State, Ireland also contributes to the EU response to the crisis in Yemen. Since 2015, the EU has allocated over &euro;554 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen.</p></reply>

Minister Coveney, along with officials from the Department, continue to engage with relevant actors, and monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  On the Security Council Ireland's focus will be on actions which contribute to building long term peace, justice and stability in Somalia, including promoting peacebuilding under the National Reconciliation Framework and ensuring inclusive political participation&mdash;particularly of women and marginalised communities. </p>  <p>  It is against this backdrop, that Ireland has taken up the role of chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee, one of the Security Council&rsquo;s subsidiary bodies.  These bodies are chaired by the Permanent Representatives of elected Council members, with Ambassador Byrne Nason chairing the Somalia Sanctions Committee.  </p>  <p>  The mandate of the Somalia Sanctions Committee is to oversee implementation of relevant Council Resolutions, which provide for a targeted arms embargo, a travel ban, and assets freeze, along with its important humanitarian carve-out.  As Chair, Ireland will seek to facilitate agreement on fulfilling the Committee&rsquo;s mandate, including improved compliance with the arms embargo, addressing Al-Shabaab financing, and advancing the human rights and accountability elements of the mandate.</p>  <p>  Ireland will also focus on leveraging sanctions as a preventative tool against threats to the peace, security and stability of Somalia, including through violations of International Humanitarian Law. </p>  <p>  In Ireland's broader work on the Council, we are committed to ensuring that voices from the region are clearly heard and heeded: we will encourage deeper dialogue between the Council, the African Union and African Member States on the security transition in Somalia&mdash;including the implications for the broader Horn of Africa. </p>  <p>  The Minister receives regular briefings from officials in the Department in Dublin and New York on all aspects of Ireland's Council membership, including the Ambassador, and provides policy direction as required.</p></reply>

More than 13 million people are in humanitarian need inside Syria and six million of these have been internally displaced. The war has also caused the biggest refugee movement from a single conflict in a generation, with almost seven million people having fled the country with over 80% staying within the region.</p>  <p>  The unprecedented political, economic and social situation across the region, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges, has underscored the need for sustained support for refugees. Despite the challenges brought by these trends, throughout nearly a decade of displacement, host countries, institutions, and communities continue to provide asylum and services to Syrian refugees, and refugees of other nationalities.</p>  <p>  In the period 2012-2020, Ireland has provided over &euro;168 million in humanitarian aid, including over &euro;25 million provided in 2020, to those affected by the conflict in Syria and the region - our largest ever response to any single crisis. In 2021 we will continue our strong commitment in support of Syrian refugees.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s support is channelled through a range of partners including non-governmental organisations, UN organisations and the EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey. These partners provide those most in need with humanitarian supplies and access to urgently-needed health, education, water, and sanitation services to ensure that Syrians affected by the crisis, including those who have been forced to flee their homes, are supported to meet their own critical needs. Through our annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response; the EU has mobilised more than &euro;20 billion since 2012 for assistance to support Syrians inside the country and in the region. </p>  <p>  As a member of the Security Council since 1 January, Ireland has a specific responsibility regarding Syria, leading on the humanitarian file along with Norway. We will work to ensure that the critical humanitarian assistance, provided by the UN and its partners, continues to reach all those most in need and at the required level. </p></reply>

From January 2021, a rolling recruitment model for the RDF is being implemented, which is similar to the model currently used for the PDF General Service recruitment. </p>  <p>  In the context of finite resources and personnel, it is necessary to strike an appropriate balance in terms of PDF and RDF recruitment in order to maintain the capacity of the Defence Forces to undertake all roles assigned by Government. While the Government remains fully committed to on-going recruitment in the RDF, it should be noted that the same personnel and resources are utilised for both PDF and RDF recruitment. Given the competing recruitment demands at present, PDF recruitment is, and will remain a priority.  However, recruitment to the RDF will be progressed having regard to the available resources.</p>  <p>  The military authorities have advised that while the organisation can process a significant number of applications in any given year, the volume is dependent on a number of variable factors.  </p></reply>

However budgetary changes that occurred in the UK in 2017 introduced a 25% tax charge, referred to as an overseas transfer charge, that can become payable in respect of the transferred funds to the QROPS schemes, under certain conditions. As part of these changes, managers of overseas pension schemes registering for QROPS are required to sign an undertaking that they would be jointly and severally liable for the overseas transfer charge, should it arise, along with the individual. This requirement of the UK tax authorities remains.  As a result of this change, and following DPER guidance, most Irish public service pension scheme did not (re)register for QROPS, as providing such an undertaking in respect of publicly funded Irish public service schemes effectively amounts to the State guaranteeing an individual&rsquo;s tax liability. My Department is guided by DPER in this respect and therefore the application was not processed because the mechanism was suspended.  Officials in my Department have made direct contact with the person in question to discuss her position further.  </p></reply>

The advisory group has been convened to advise Government on all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures.  The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>At a meeting of the group on 22 January, the Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union presented its Report on the 2021 State Examinations and Return to School. Following this meeting, the group agreed that there would be an intensive set of engagements in respect of exploring further possible options for the examinations, having regard to the findings of the recent ISSU Report on the 2021 State Examinations. </p><p>The sub-group exploring these options has since met on three occasions and has discussed further possible measures that could be taken to address the demands on students preparing for the examinations.  Having regard to the impact of current school closures for face-to-face tuition, there was also discussion on the scope and form of assessment for the various examination components, written and non-written. </p><p>All partners are committed to acting in the interests and wellbeing of students, who are at the heart of this process.</p><p>A meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Education also took place on 1 February which provided an opportunity for consideration of possible options prior to consideration by Government as a whole.</p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, have been engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools.</p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the original closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020 (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on<i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool</i>. </p></reply>

In accordance with this agreement pupils will attend on a 50 per cent basis to allow for attendance of reduced numbers within the school setting. This will be reviewed in line with public health advice. </p><p>On Monday 22 February, special classes in mainstream primary schools will re-open to pupils.</p><p>Talks will continue this week and in the coming period with stakeholders, including within the post primary school sector, on further phases of return, so that a wider reopening can be delivered for children as soon as possible. </p><p>During the period of school closure, remote learning provision will continue to be made available to all pupils in line with each school&rsquo;s remote learning plan.</p><p>Recognising that remote learning is particularly challenging for children with additional needs, the Department of Education is putting in place a supplementary programme to support the education and/or care needs of pupils with complex needs. </p><p>An allocation of five hours per week of home-based teaching or care supports will be made available to eligible pupils. This allocation is intended to supplement, and not replace, the remote teaching provided by the pupil&rsquo;s school and can be provided by a teacher or SNA in a student&rsquo;s home, at evenings and weekends. Participation in the programme is voluntary for families, teachers and SNAs and must be delivered in accordance with Public Health Advice. </p><p>Further information on the in-person supplementary scheme to support the education and care needs of pupils with complex needs is being finalised and will be issued to schools over the coming days. Parents will be advised on the application process, which will be similar to a summer provision scheme, with parents engaging the teacher or SNA directly and the Department arranging payment. </p><p>It is intended that this programme would be supported by teachers and SNAs who may opt in to participate, on a paid basis, to help ensure a better learning experience for these pupils and to build on the learning taking place as part of the remote provision.  </p><p>As therapy services are provided to children who require them by the Health Service Executive, questions in relation to the provision of therapy services should be referred to the Department of Health or to the Health Service Executive.</p></reply>

Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions as is the current situation.  Schools can use this funding, inter alia, to acquire software applications or platforms to enable remote learning and communications, and to provide for devices to be loaned to teachers and learners in particular where needed to enable engagement with remote learning. </p><p>In 2020, &euro;80m in funding issued to all recognised primary, special and post-primary schools, in respect of pupils and students following primary and post-primary programmes. All eligible schools received a lump sum payment and an  allocation based on a per capita rate determined by the number of qualifying schools and enrolment data. An increased per capita rate is paid in respect of special schools and special classes in mainstream schools, and to DEIS category schools. Post primary schools receive a higher rate that that applied to primary schools in line with the rate of capitation paid, in view of the wider curriculum to be supported.

The pandemic has brought significant challenges to the education system, and I am acutely aware of the impacts that this has had on those students preparing to sit their final examinations. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19.</p><p>The planning work underway in respect of the State Examinations in 2021 is being assisted by an Advisory Group of key stakeholders which has met on a number of occasions in recent months. The advisory group has been convened to advise Government on all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures.  The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>At a meeting of the group on 22 January, the Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union presented its Report on the 2021 State Examinations and Return to School. Following this meeting, the group agreed that there would be an intensive set of engagements in respect of exploring further possible options for the examinations, having regard to the findings of the recent ISSU Report on the 2021 State Examinations. </p><p>The sub-group exploring these options has since met on three occasions and has discussed further possible measures that could be taken to address the demands on students preparing for the examinations.  Having regard to the impact of current school closures for face-to-face tuition, there was also discussion on the scope and form of assessment for the various examination components, written and non-written. </p><p>All partners are committed to acting in the interests and wellbeing of students, who are at the heart of this process.</p><p>A meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Education also took place on 1 February which provided an opportunity for consideration of possible options prior to consideration by Government as a whole.</p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, have been engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools.</p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the original closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020 (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.

This was not based on a changed assessment of the risks in relation to transmission levels in schools. </p>  <p>  Public Health has consistently advised that schools are safe places for both students and staff because of the infection control measures in place in our schools. Public Health have also stated that the new variants of the disease do not change the infection prevention and control measures required in schools. Schools have been supported by a funding package of &euro;450m to put in place and maintain these key measures. Public Health advice is that compliance with these measures ensure that schools remain safe places for children and staff.</p>  <p>  My Department has agreed a plan with the relevant education stakeholders for the phased return to in-person learning for children in special schools and children in special classes in mainstream schools. This phased reopening will commence next Thursday 11 February with children in special schools returning on a 50 per cent shared basis from that date.   </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement with public health and the education partners is focusing on the safe return of all pupils and students to school at the earliest opportunity, especially for children in priority cohorts and supporting the provision of remote learning at this time. </p></reply>

It was decided that the introuction of the model would be deferred.  This will allow time for the necessary planning and trining for schools.</p>  <p>  As an interim step, SNA allocations were frozen at their current levels for 2020/21 with provision for additionality where necessary. Deparment Circular 30/2020 sets out the arrangements for SNA allocations for the 2020/21 school year.</p>  <p>  Schools were advised in the first instance to review and reprioritise deployment of all SNAs within mainstram settings and allocate resources on the basis that those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.</p>  <p>  Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014. SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p>  <p>  Where schools consider their SNA allocation to be inadequate to meet current needs, a school can seek a review by making an application to the NCSE.</p></reply>

It is a key requirement of the act that all school admission policies are fair and transparent. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018 the appeals system provides for a parent/guardian to take an appeal in respect of a decision by a school board or person acting on behalf of a school&rsquo;s board to permanently exclude a student from a school; to suspend a student from attendance at a school for 20 or more school days in a school year; or to refuse to admit a student to a school. Regarding refusal to admit a student this decision can be because the school is oversubscribed or for a reason other than oversubscription. </p>  <p>  Appeals in relation to expulsion, suspension and refusal to enrol for reasons other than oversubscription are held by oral hearing.</p>  <p>  Appeals in relation to oversubscription cases are examined without oral hearing and a parent/guardian must first seek a review by the school&rsquo;s board of management before taking a section 29 appeal in respect of oversubscription. </p>  <p>  An independent appeals committee are appointed to consider each appeal.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal is allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned. </p>  <p>  My Department does not categorise appeals by location. However, I can advise that the total number of appeals under section 29 in 2020 was 389.  Of these 209 proceeded to a hearing and 64 of these were upheld at the hearing.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-03a.1095.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021020300072#WRP05700"><p>While parents will very naturally be concerned for their sixth class children in the transition to post-primary education in 2021 and, in particular, their concern for the impact that the Covid-19 school closures may have had on their children&rsquo;s learning, there are no plans to have pupils repeat 6th class. It is important that pupils/students move on with their peers and continue to the next stage of their education.  </p><p>There has been much learning across the system in the 2019/202 school year in relation to transitions and my Department is confident that the education system will use this knowledge to respond carefully to the needs of these children so that they can transfer successfully to age-appropriate, post-primary education in September 2021. </p><p>For example, primary schools will prepare children for transition to post-primary education.  Primary teachers are working hard to prevent and address gaps in the learning of sixth class pupils. This is currently happening remotely and will be a priority also for teachers when the children return to the classroom. Focussing on children&rsquo;s well-being and resilience will also be priorities for teachers as they help their sixth class pupils prepare for the move to post-primary education.</p><p>Post-primary schools will also be keenly aware of the nature of the school experience of the children in 2020-21. Post-primary teachers will be in a position to respond with agility to the needs of the incoming first year students in 2021 and to set realistic, differentiated expectations for their learning.</p><p>The successful transfer of sixth class children to post-primary education in 2021 will require ongoing, collaboration and careful planning between primary schools and post-primary schools. This will happen at a local level through transition programmes involving meetings of the primary and post-primary teachers with the children and their parents as well as through the transfer of key information to the post-primary schools. The NEPS Continuum of Support and the Home School Liaison Officers in DEIS schools can also be utilised to support the transition of pupils.  </p><p>Communication between the primary and post primary schools and with the parents and children is of utmost importance in order to ensure progression is as seamless as possible. Sharing information about children&rsquo;s learning is a key way of supporting their transition from primary post-primary school. This information transfer:</p><p>-  provides a rounded picture of children&rsquo;s progress and achievement at primary school</p><p>-  ensures continuity and progression for learners</p><p>-  alerts post-primary schools if additional support is needed to support is needed to support learning.</p><p>Primary schools should use the Education Passport materials developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to support the transfer of information which also allows for the child and his/ her parents to contribute to the information supplied.</p><p>The Education Passport materials include a:</p><p>-  6th Class Report Card </p><p>-  My Profile sheet for children</p><p>-  My Child&rsquo;s Profile sheet for parent(s)/guardian(s)</p><p>This transfer of information will ease the transition experiences of pupils and support them as they make the transition to learning in the post-primary education environment in September 2021.</p></reply>

All special schools are classified as primary national schools.</p><p>There were also 10,328 pupils enrolled to special classes including 7,520 pupils enrolled to special classes in primary schools and 2,808 pupils enrolled to special classes in post primary schools. </p><p>Special school placements are provided for other children with very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week. </p><p>Special classes are provided for children with more complex needs who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day.  </p><p>In relation to the number of pupils with special educational needs who attend mainstream schools, from 2017 a new model for allocating special education teachers to schools was introduced.</p><p>DES Circular 007/2019 for primary schools and 008/2019 for post primary schools set out the details of the model for allocating special education teachers to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at www.education.ie.</p><p>The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.  </p><p>Under the special education teacher allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.</p><p>Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Children do not have to be labelled with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.</p><p>The model gives greater freedom to schools to give extra teaching help to the pupils who most need it, regardless of their diagnosis.</p><p>Schools also do not have to give a set amount of time to pupils based on their disability category. They can give the most assistance to the pupils who need the support most and allocate resources based on needs.</p><p>Accordingly, schools have discretion to allocate additional teaching time to pupils with special educational needs, or additional learning needs, in mainstream schools, without a requirement for a formal diagnosis of a particular disability. As this identification of need, and distribution of teaching time, occurs locally within schools, my Department does not hold details of the total number of pupils receiving additional teaching support on the basis of having special educational needs in mainstream schools. </p></reply>

The Government commissioned ESRI research which identified three key payments by the Department of Social Protection to channel carbon tax revenues towards this cohort. These were the Qualified Child Allowance, the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, effective from January 2021, the weekly Fuel Allowance payment has been increased by &euro;3.50 per week to &euro;28 for a period of 28 weeks.  Also from January 2021, Qualified Child payments have been increased by &euro;2 per week, from &euro;36 to &euro;38 per week, for children under 12 years of age and by &euro;5 per week, from &euro;40 to &euro;45 per week, for children aged 12 and over.  It is estimated that this will benefit 419,000 children who are most in need.  The Living Alone Allowance was also increased in Budget 2021 by &euro;5 from &euro;14 to &euro;19 at an overall cost in 2021 of &euro;57.5m. </p>  <p>  Therefore, all TSA recipients have benefitted from an increase in payments totalling &euro;8.50 weekly during Fuel Season and &euro;5 outside Fuel Season as a result of Budget 2021 changes.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department operates both Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers.</p>  <p>  All proposals, including any proposals to introduce a new support allowance for people to help offset the cost of broadband or to increase the weekly rate of TSA could only be considered while taking account of overall Government policy and in a budgetary context.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The scheme aimed to provide jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement. The scheme provided a supportive structure for participants, including case worker support for both placement hosts and jobseekers.</p><p>Since the scheme's inception, a total of 958 people have commenced a placement, while there are currently 87 participants on the YESS.  To date, a total of 786 employers have provided YESS placements.</p><p>The type of work experience undertaken by participants involved roles across a number of different sectors including - community and voluntary, hospitality and food, ICT and telecoms, manufacturing, retail, sales and marketing, science and healthcare and construction. Recruitment to the scheme in the scheme was affected by Covid-19 during 2020, with fewer participants than anticipated and an associated reduction in scheme expenditure with an estimated outturn of &euro;1.7 million for the year. </p><p>In the July Jobs Stimulus the government committed to  a &euro;200m investment in training, education, skill development, work placement schemes, recruitment subsidies and jobs search and assistance measures aimed to help those who have lost their jobs find a new one, retrain or develop new skills, in particular for emerging growth sectors.  Included in this is provision for a funded work placement scheme to provide work experience for jobseekers who have been unemployed for more than six months regardless of age. A particular objective is to provide a mechanism for those with recent work experience or with sector specific skills to pivot into new employment/jobs through additional learning with new and relevant work experience. </p><p>Existing YESS participants will be given the option to transfer onto the new programme prior to its launch. Those who do not wish to transfer can complete their YESS scheme as usual.  The budget allocations for YESS in 2020 and 2021 are set out in tabular format below.</p><p>Budget Allocations for YESS <table>    <tr>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;000</td>       <td>&euro;000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2,440</td>       <td>3,350</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The on-going payment of Mortgage Interest Supplement did not address the long-term housing challenges for people in serious mortgage arrears; and,</p>  <p>  2.  The Central Bank's Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides for an appropriate framework for customers, with the responsibility of forbearance for a customer&rsquo;s mortgage difficulties resting with the mortgage service provider.  </p>  <p>  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported remains through on-going engagement with their lender to explore a sustainable and appropriate response from their lending institution. Under the CCMA (2013), measures and policies are in place to support customers in financial difficulty with their mortgage commitments.  The CCMA is issued by the Central Bank under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989.</p>  <p>  The CCMA provides support for those that are in: arrears, pre-arrears or those who fall under scope of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). Under the CCMA, lending institutions are encouraging customers to contact them at the earliest opportunity regarding their concerns and any particular circumstances which may impact on the customer&rsquo;s financial well-being. </p>  <p>  Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) on behalf of its members has recently stated that the industry continues to use a case by case approach to support those customers adversely impacted by the Coronavirus pandemic, with standard payment breaks offered as  part of the wide range of solutions provided to customers.  The number of active payment breaks for Private Dwellings (PDH) mortgages continues to decline with only 2,000 PDH mortgage payment breaks currently active as at December 2020 (9,000 as at October 2020). </p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, also continues to provides assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

During each period of Level-5 restrictions, CE participants,  whose contracts were due to end during the period of these restrictions have had their contracts extended for the duration of these restrictions.   The latest CE contract extension date is the 26th   March, 2021, and this will continue to be monitored having regard to Government guidelines and restrictions.</p>  <p>  Over 5,000 contracts which were due to come to an end since last October are having their contracts extended under this latest arrangement.  However, there will be no cliff edge or sudden cut off point for ending this number of contracts on whatever the final date of extensions will be. Subsequent to the final extension date,  there will be a planned ending of contracts on a phased basis, over a period of time, in order to ensure continuity of local services.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of the CE recruitment challenges arising from the current restrictions which has had an impact on the ability of some CE schemes to recruit new CE participants and on Intreo activation staff in referring new participants to schemes.  My Department officials both centrally and in local Intreo Offices continue to work with CE sponsoring authorities to identify and refer potential CE participants to schemes where it is safe to do so in compliance with public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  Where a CE participant finishes up on their CE scheme without completing the training outlined in their Individual Learning Plan (ILP) and if unfortunately they remain unemployed, they may be able to continue their training through other training supports provided by my Department such as the Training Support Grant (TSG) and the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA).</p>  <p>  The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.  CE will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, while maintaining the role of CE as an active labour market programme.   </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of this programme and will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities through the provision of services.</p></reply>

I confirm that my Department received an application for CA from the second named person on 20 October 2020.  </p>  <p>  The application was awarded to the person concerned on 1 December 2020 with effect from 22 October 2020.  The first payment issued to her nominated bank account on 10 December 2020.  This included arrears of allowance due from 22 October 2020 to 9 December 2020 less any overpayments that occurred.  The person concerned was notified on 1 December 2020 of this decision, the reason for it and of her right of review and appeal. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  </p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.</p>  <p>  A person who has paid a total of 260 or more contributions at an appropriate class since entering employment is entitled to receive payment of Illness Benefit for a maximum of 624 paid days in any one period of interruption of employment.  The maximum for a person who has paid between 104 and 259 contributions is 312 paid days.  Days of Illness Benefit paid are reckonable towards the maximum number of days payable, regardless of whether they arise from a diagnosis of Covid-19, a requirement to isolate as a possible source of infection of Covid-19 or from another illness.</p>  <p>  If a person has exhausted their entitlement to standard Illness Benefit, he or she can apply for the enhanced Illness Benefit.  They are only entitled to it if they have a current contract of employment and a paid contribution in the last four weeks or are self-employed in the four weeks preceding the first day of certification.  </p>  <p>  A person in receipt of standard Illness Benefit who has been in employment or self-employment in the four week period prior to being medically certified as either required to self-isolate as a possible source of infection, or diagnosed with Covid-19, may transfer to the enhanced rate payment and revert afterwards to the standard rate, subject to ongoing certification and meeting the eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  A person in receipt of standard Illness Benefit who has not been in employment or self-employment in the previous four weeks is not entitled to the higher rate of payment if they are diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a possible source of infection, but they may continue on standard Illness Benefit, subject to meeting the eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.  The Department may also make an exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.   </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

Therefore, the need for credited weekly contributions does not arise for self-employed contributors.</p>  <p>  Self-employed workers in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment and who are seeking to maintain their business can have an income of up to &euro;960 over an eight-week period and retain their full payment. Such recipients simply need to inform the Department of Social Protection if their income is over &euro;960 in any eight-week period.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 makes provision for the attribution of social insurance contributions, for a period that may be prescribed, for employed contributors who are beneficiaries of certain Covid-19 income supports including the pandemic unemployment payment.</p>  <p>  That Act also makes provision  for the Minister for Social Protection, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to make regulations, having considered certain matters set out in the Act including the potential impact of Covid-19 on the entitlements of employed and self-employed contributors and the manner in which social insurance contributions are paid by employed and self-employed contributors, to apply the attribution of contributions measure to persons specified in those regulations.</p>  <p>  A self-employed contributor has nine months following the end of the contribution year, or from the day in the contribution year in which he or she ceases to be such a contributor, to remit and pay his or her social insurance liability for that contribution year. For example, self-employed contributors have until September 2021 to pay their social insurance contribution in respect of the 2020 contribution year.</p>  <p>  Once data on the social insurance returns made by self-employed workers in respect of 2020 are available later this year or early in 2022, I and my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will be in a position to consider the factors set out in the Act and decide if regulations are necessary to protect the social insurance entitlements of certain self-employed workers who were in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment and who were not in a position to discharge their social insurance liability for 2020.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Latest data gathered from the City/County Childcare Committees show that more than 1,800 services are open nationally, many of which at operating at low occupancy levels.</p>  <p>  ELC and SAC services are privately operated and are therefore free to set their own admission policies but I am aware that many of these providers are already accommodating additional demand for ELC and SAC at this time due to school closures.</p>  <p>  The City/County Childcare Committees are available to assist parents currently experiencing difficulties securing a place for their child to find suitable childcare in their local area on the basis of current available capacity.

For the small numbers where there are particular challenges, the Sustainability Fund will open a new strand of funding tailored to the present arrangements. </p><p>If providers do not access the conditional funding, they may still request fees from parents.  Contract terms between providers and parents may stipulate specific obligations of both parties and I acknowledge that the relationship between a service and parent is a private one based on a contract between those two parties. </p><p>Providers will be able to confirm if they are receiving enhanced funding, and consequently, their fee arrangements. They will also be able to clarify refund or credit arrangements for any pre-paid fees. These arrangements will apply from February 1st to March 5th. </p><p>Detailed guidance has issued to providers on these matters and is available at .</p></reply>

The investigation was framed to provide a clear emphasis on the experiences of women and children who spent time in these institutions. Initially the public focus was very narrow and related to concerns around the former home in Tuam, Co. Galway. This focus broadened significantly in the course of the extensive public consultation process and inter-departmental review which assisted the then Government in defining the terms of reference for this inquiry.  </p>  <p>  Notably, the criteria used to identify Mother and Baby homes included having the main function of providing sheltered and supervised ante- and post-natal facilities to single mothers and their children, including both board and lodgings; and an ethos which those running the institutions considered to promote a regime of work, training or education as part of an overall approach to either rehabilitating single mothers, or to give them training for living independently. Religious ethos, or the private or public status of potentially relevant institutions, were not determining factors in the analysis. This is evident in the fact that a number of privately operated institutions were included within the scope of the inquiry. The specific institution raised by the Deputy is not one of the 14 named Mother and Baby Homes, which the Commission was directed to investigate, alongside the representative sample of County Homes selected by the Commission.</p>  <p>  Chapter 1 and 2 of the Commission's report describes and lists many of the other types of institutions, including maternity homes, which were in operation in the period in question. A number of maternity homes with addresses on North Circular Road, are identified in this section of the Report, although the Commission did not specifically investigate these separate institutions. </p></reply>

Piloting Baby Boxes is just one initiative which is part of a wide ranging strategy addressing various aspects of the lives of children from birth to age five including supports for parents to balance working and caring, developments in early learning and care and health initiatives.</p>  <p>  The gift of the Baby Box is intended as a welcome from the state for a new arrival to a family and an acknowledgement of this very significant moment for parents. The universal distribution of Baby Boxes also reflects an important equality principle that each child is given something of equal value at the start of their life. The concept of Baby Boxes originates in Finland (and has been implemented in a number of other countries) and consists of a package of items to assist with the transition to parenthood. The pilot will undertake research and consultation to determine items for inclusion in the pack and these may include safety items, baby clothes and toys to support early development and books.</p>  <p>  Key objectives with the Baby Box and linked communications will include support for parent-infant bonding, information on baby development and early learning, advice and support for breastfeeding and promotion of infant health and safety.</p>  <p>  Owing to Covid-19, work on the pilot project has been delayed. However, the Terms of Reference for the Working Group are being finalised and this group will be established in the coming weeks to lead this development. An initial task of this Group will be to finalise the scope of this project and agree a detailed project plan. Key initial considerations will include the identification of the pilot area, agreement on the optimal timing for (pre- or post-natal), and channel of, distribution of the baby box and the likely contents.  Research and engagement with parents will be undertaken to inform the identification of items for inclusion.</p>  <p>  Following this initial scoping phase, the Working Group will oversee a process to appoint suitable partners to develop and distribute the baby boxes and undertake a full evaluation of the pilot.</p></reply>

The provision of suitable childcare for the children of frontline healthcare workers, particularly for those with new childcare needs as a result of the closure of schools, is a significant concern for the Government. My officials have been examining options as regards this and are engaging with colleagues in the Department of Health to address the issue.</p>  <p>  Following Cabinet approval on 26 January for the continuation of additional measures under full Level 5 restrictions, I have announced new funding measures to support the Early Learning and Care and School Aged Childcare (ELC and SAC) sector to cover the period 1 February to 5 March. These measures have been developed in order to ensure that childcare services which are open can continue to operate safely and in line with public health advice, with a particular focus on addressing the childcare needs of those working in essential services and for vulnerable children.</p>  <p>  The pre-school (ECCE) programme will continue to be suspended during these extended restrictions, however all other early learning and childcare services can remain open for children whose parents work in an essential service and for vulnerable children. </p>  <p>  The new funding arrangements are as follows: </p>  <p>  - Services open during this period will continue to receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under other Department schemes (i.e. the National Childcare Scheme (NCS), the Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP), and the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM)) These services can also receive the additional 30% of ECCE Programme funding if they commit to certain conditions that includes waiving fees for parents not using the service and retaining staff where possible.    </p>  <p>  - Services closed during this period, where the closure is approved by the Department, will receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under other Department schemes (i.e. NCS, CCSP, and AIM). This funding will be conditional on a commitment to waive fees for parents and retain staff where possible. </p>  <p>  - A newly designed Covid-19 Support Payment is being put in place to support some providers with a significant reliance on parental fee income to waive fees during this period while remaining sustainable. </p></reply>

The Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, and the City and County Managers' Association were some of the bodies included in these consultations.  In addition, representatives of accommodation centre residents and civil society organisations with refugee policy/practice expertise and housing policy/practice expertise (including Approved Housing Bodies) have been consulted.</p>  <p>  Good progress has been made on drafting the White Paper and work is now focusing on testing the accommodation proposals that will be contained in it. In view of the extent of change proposed, the White Paper will take some more time than originally envisaged and it will now be submitted to Government in February. </p>  <p>  The replacement of the direct provision system is complex.  It is recognised by all involved that it will take some time. In order to meet our legal obligations to provide accommodation and other support services for protection applicants, existing accommodation centres will continue to operate in the short to medium term.  However, in doing so we will be focusing on the provision of own-door accommodation and facilities to allow for independent living (access to cooking and laundry facilities and communal family areas outside bedrooms) and greatly reducing any need for the use of hotels and guest-houses as an emergency measure. </p></reply>

The then Minister appointed Ms Marion Reynolds, an experienced social worker from Northern Ireland, to oversee a review of a sample of the files held by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) and Tusla.</p>  <p>  The Independent Reviewer worked with the AAI and Tusla to identify a sample of files to review to determine if they contain comparable evidence of illegal birth registrations. Records were selected from: adoption agencies; nursing homes which acted as &lsquo;informal adoption agencies&rsquo;; and boarding out services selected geographically to provide national coverage.</p>  <p>  The report of the Independent Reviewer ('Sampling Review') was not published upon its completion so as not to encroach on the work of the Commission of Inquiry into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters. A copy of the report was provided to the Commission. </p>  <p>  Now that the Commission has published its final report, I intend to publish the Sampling Review into illegal birth registrations in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

It is currently planned for these arrangements to be in place until 5 March, with the timeframe remaining subject to review in the context of the evolving public health circumstances.</p>  <p>  Latest data gathered from the City/County Childcare Committees show that more than 1,800 early learning and childcare services are open nationally.  The majority of services are operating at an average occupancy of 25%, however there is a wide range (5% to 70%) in occupancy levels across the sector. </p>  <p>  New funding arrangements have been put in place for period 1 February to 5 March that will enable these services to remain open, even at very low levels of occupancy while also retaining their staff and waiving fees for parents who are not using early learning and childcare services at this time. These funding arrangements are: </p>  <p>- Services open will continue to receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under other Department schemes. These services can also receive the additional 30% of the value of ECCE Programme funding if they commit to certain conditions that includes waiving fees for parents not using the service and retaining staff where possible.   </p>  <p>- Services closed, where the closure is approved by my Department, will receive 70% of the value of ECCE programme funding and 100% of funding provided under other Department schemes. This funding will be conditional on a commitment to waive fees for parents and retain staff where possible.</p>  <p>- A newly designed Covid-19 Operating Support Payment has been put in place to support some providers with a significant reliance on parental fee income to waive fees during this period while remaining sustainable.</p>  <p>  EWSS remains central to these funding arrangements. With enhanced EWSS rates until end March 2021, EWSS is estimated to cover 80% of payroll costs or 50% of full operating costs of these services.</p></reply>

In addition to the information provided in this reply, my Office will arrange for responses to issue to the individuals concerned. </p>  <p>  In responding to the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation, the Government has approved the development of a Strategic Action Plan. The plan encompasses a comprehensive suite of 22 measures, which are intended to respond to the priority needs and concerns of former residents and their families.  Most importantly, we will take a survivor-centred approach in the development and implementation of these measures. The Action Plan centres on a number of distinct themes including: access to personal information; archiving and databases; education and research; memorialisation; dignified burial, and restorative recognition. </p>  <p>  This is a hugely important process for all connected to these institutions and I will be working with colleagues and survivors to advance these matters as a priority. The Government's Strategic Action Plan is now available to view on my Department's website at  www.gov.ie/dcediy.  </p>  <p>  As a first step, an Interdepartmental Group  (IDG) has been established to develop proposals for a bespoke ex-gratia Restorative Recognition Scheme to provide financial recognition in respect of the issues examined by the Commission of Investigation.  I want the scheme to be designed as early as possible in 2021. The IDG is tasked with reporting by the end of April to enable specific proposals to be brought to Government. </p>  <p>  I have also prioritised the preparation of Information and Tracing legislation to give individuals the fullest possible access to their birth and early life information. The database and related records which were transferred recently from the Commission of Investigation to Tusla will greatly support timely access to such information in accordance with this proposed new legislation.</p>  <p>  In relation to the proposed developments at Bessborough, I understand the distress which the timing of this proposal has caused for those most centrally connected to this issue. I share their concerns in relation to the risks associated with this development. For these reasons, I made submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Cork City Council asking that any decisions on the proposed development on the Bessborough site take appropriate account of the Commission&rsquo;s Interim and Final Reports and the wishes of survivors and the families of the children who died while resident in this institution. I understand that planning permission for one part of the development has been refused in recent days by Cork County Council.  </p>  <p>  While there are understandable questions in relation to the holding of inquests, it is important to acknowledge the independence of each Coroner in the discharge of their statutory functions in this regard. Specific queries on the role of the Coroner's service should be directed to my colleague the Minister for Justice who is responsible for policy and legislation in this area. </p></reply>

Existing or prospective early learning and childcare providers can receive expert advice on establishing, or expanding, an early learning and childcare service from the national network of City / County Childcare Committees (CCCs), who can provide detailed information on grants and low cost local enterprise loans and commercial borrowing options that may be available.  </p><p>Once a service is registered with Tulsa to operate as an early learning and childcare service, it can enter into funding agreements with my Department to deliver its funding programmes including the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE pre-school programme.  </p><p>Childcare was identified as a strategic priority in the National Development Plan, with capital funding earmarked to develop the early learning and childcare infrastructure over its duration.  This Plan is currently under review. Subject to the outcome of that review, my Department will prepare a plan to deliver on capital investment under the NDP with the aim of ensuring the demand for high-quality early learning and childcare meets supply.</p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the following information has been received from Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in response to this question.</p><p>Local Enterprise Office input. </p><p>The 31 Local Enterprise Offices nationwide are a &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business and act as a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service for all Government supports available to the SME sector. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services or construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices have moved their training programmes, workshops and networking meet-ups online and new entrepreneurs can now enrol for the Start Your Own Business (SYOB) Programme in this manner.  The objective of SYOB is to assist participants in assessing an idea, its viability and then making an informed decision on whether to proceed or take a step back. </p><p>The programme is designed to guide participants through the various aspects of business and business planning with no prior business knowledge necessary. It runs over 6-8 modules with varied course structure and schedule. At conclusion participants will have the tools to complete a business plan and an action plan to develop their business idea. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices also run a Mentor Programme, this is a service offered free of charge, where clients work with an experienced mentor to identify solutions to areas of exposure within their business and develop strategies that are more robust, address issues and maximise potential opportunities, including those around Covid-19 challenges. </p><p>In conjunction with the SYOB Programme, a mentor can provide invaluable insights and direction to those starting their business journey and can assist new business owners by planning the steps needed to make their business idea a success.</p><p>Microenterprise Loan Fund input</p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund operated by Microfinance Ireland assists businesses with fewer than ten employees.  </p><p>Microfinance Ireland provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 to microenterprises and fills the lending gap in the market by lending to business that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders.  It lends to business that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders and applies interest rate charges for its lending which are not reflective of its credit risk.  In particular, its &ldquo;Start-Up Loan&rdquo; is aimed at helping businesses to get up and running.</p><p>There are no fees or charges on start-up loans from Microfinance Ireland.  Loans are available with fixed repayments which helps in planning financial commitments during the important early stage of the business and are available with interest-only payments for the first 3 months.</p><p>Once a Start-Up loan is approved, MFI can also provide invaluable mentoring support from an experienced business mentor on the Local Enterprise Office (LEO) Mentor Panel. Mentoring is a vital extra support tool to help your business, particularly in the early stages. </p><p>The Deputy may wish to contact the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment directly for further information.</p></reply>

Many of the issues highlighted in the survey, in particular the level of pay among those working in early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SLC), are issues on which I have been actively engaging since becoming Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious need for significant improvement in pay and working conditions for practitioners in ELC and SAC services. The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy. It also contributes to challenges of recruitment and retention of staff, which are key to the consistency of care provided to children. The risk of practitioners seeking to leave the sector is one that is highlighted in the SIPTU Big Start Campaign's 2020 survey. The most recent published data indicates that the average hourly wage in the sector was &euro;12.55 in mid-2019.</p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff working in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions. However, wages in the sector remain too low. Given the importance of the issue, it is imperative that my Department continues to engage with provider and staff representatives. </p>  <p>  In December 2020, working in partnership with SIPTU and CSI/IBEC, I began a short process in which interested parties were invited to discuss how best to address issues of pay and conditions in the sector and how a Joint Labour Committee might support this. Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, chaired the meetings, which concluded in the last few days. Dr Duffy will shortly submit to me a report outlining the issues and possible solutions raised in the process, and making a recommendation on next steps.  I am hopeful that implementation of his recommendation will support progress in addressing pay and conditions in the sector.</p></reply>

Included in First 5 is a commitment to designing a new Funding Model to deliver additional funding to early learning and care and school-age childcare providers.</p><p>In September 2019, my predecessor announced the establishment of an Expert Group to develop the new Funding Model. The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. The group is considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area.</p><p>The Expert Group has met twelve times to date.</p><p>The Terms of Reference for the Expert Group include the need to review existing measures and to draw on international evidence on how to structure funding. To support this, Frontier Economics was selected to deliver a significant programme of research to the Expert Group. Frontier Economics has delivered the following research papers, which have been published:</p><p>1. Comparative and Contextual Analysis of ELC and SAC Fees, Staff Wages and Public Investment</p><p>2. International approaches to funding ELC</p><p>3. Review of working conditions for ELC and SAC staff</p><p>4. Potential mechanisms to control fees charged to parents</p><p>5. Approaches to identifying children and/or services in need of additional support </p><p>Further papers, on disadvantage, quality and shared governance and collaboration, will be delivered and published shortly.</p><p>The Terms of Reference of the Expert Group also include the need for consultation and engagement with stakeholders in order to agree the principles to underpin the new Funding Model. The first phase of consultation and engagement took place between August and December 2020. The consultation included a call for submissions, a parental poll, two webinars and a focused discussions with providers, practitioners and parents. A report on key issues identified during the consultation will be published shortly. Further stakeholder engagement and consultation is scheduled for Q1 &amp;amp; Q2 2021.</p><p>Co-ordination with other significant reform projects planned for the sector in respect of Workforce Development and the Review of the Operating System is ongoing. A meeting between representatives of the Expert Group and the Workforce Development Plan Steering Group took place in January.</p><p>It is expected that a report on the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations will be submitted to the Minister in November 2021 for consideration before submission to wider Government.</p><p>Material relating to the Funding Model, including meeting papers, research papers, and reports, is available on a dedicated website, www.first5fundingmodel.ie. </p><p>First 5 also includes a number of commitments related to the workforce for ELC and SAC, including development of a Workforce Development Plan (WDP). The WDP is intended to set out plans to achieve the First 5 workforce commitments, including to raise the profile of careers in the sector and to ensure sufficient numbers of staff at all levels within the sector. The Workforce Development Plan will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.</p><p>Specific objectives include: </p><p>- To achieve a graduate-led (50%) workforce by 2028 for early learning and care.</p><p>- All regulated childminders will hold a minimum qualification.</p><p>- All regulated school-age childcare staff will hold a minimum qualification.</p><p>After a period of extensive public consultation on the subject of qualifications standards for childminding and school-age childcare in late 2020, the Workforce Development Plan will focus on the creation of pathways towards reaching an appropriate qualification standard for both, recognising their unique backgrounds and requirements.</p><p>Phase one of development of the WDP involved the drafting of an interim report. This report is being finalised before publication in the near future. Phase two will involve detailed implementation plans to be prepared by a number of working groups throughout 2021. </p><p>The WDP Stakeholder Group, consisting of a wide range of different voices involved in the sector, has been consulted on each piece of work to date and has provided valuable insights informing policy developments and the consultation process.  </p><p>A programme of consultation on draft proposals on the WDP was rolled out, consisting of: </p><p>- A call for submissions, which ran from 19 August to 2 October, for all involved in the sector to have their say. </p><p>- Webinars on 22 September and 16 December informed the sector of work to date on the project and important details relating to the consultation process. </p><p>- A series of nine consultation events involving focussed discussions with practitioners over two weeks from the 12 to 23 of October. The themes of these discussions were recruitment and retention, qualifications and initial training and ongoing training and CPD. </p><p>The feedback from the consultation process informed the drafting of the interim report, which is due to be published in early 2021.</p></reply>

I have a huge appreciation for the valuable contribution of such organisations in delivering important services to support vulnerable children and families. I am acutely aware of the financial constraints faced by many such organisations and indeed by Tusla in seeking to meet the extensive needs that exist.  I acknowledge that significant challenges remain for frontline organisations, particularly for staff who may not have not seen pay increases in that time.</p>  <p>  While I take on board the points raised, I think the issues in question are not unique to the service you mention or services generally that are commissioned by Tusla or funded by my Department. Issues such as rates of pay and other matters raised by the Deputy for employees of the non-profit sector will require wider consideration across Government.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to have secured significant additional funding for Tusla in this year's Budget which, I believe, will help the Agency more fully achieve its vision.  The exact details of where this additional funding is allocated by Tusla will be finalised in the coming weeks with Tusla&rsquo;s Business Plan for 2021.</p>  <p>  The funding arrangements between individual organisations and Tusla is agreed under a Service Level Agreement (SLA). As the funding arrangement for the particular service referenced by the Deputy is an operational matter for Tusla, I have requested that the Agency respond to the Deputy directly on this matter.</p></reply>

However given the evolving public health situation it is not possible at this time to provide any concrete information on what the new academic year may look like. I would encourage students to engage with their higher education institution regarding their plans for the 2021 academic year in advance of booking student accommodation.</p>  <p>  Students who are renting private accommodation under a lease are entitled to the same legal protections as any other tenant. Tenant rights are set out in the Residential Tenancies Act (2004, as amended). There is protection provided under this legislation for deposits, as as they are considered the lawful property of the tenant until the landlord establishes a right to it. Information on tenant rights and responsibilities are available on the website of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).   </p>  <p>  The emergency rental provisions brought in as part of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, which expired on 1 August, applied to student accommodation. Any future legislation on this matter will also cover student accommodation.</p>  <p>  For student-specific accommodation the license terms including cost, duration, refund and cancellation policies should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. Under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students residing in student-specific accommodation under licence agreements have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the university sector has been actively engaging with students on the issue of accommodation refunds for the current academic year. As a result of the decision to minimise on-site teaching, all universities have confirmed that students who opted to leave their university-owned student accommodation as a result of reduced on-campus activity will be offered refunds or rental credits. The processing of these refunds is a matter for the universities themselves, and any student who wishes to receive a refund for their on-campus accommodation should engage directly with their university&rsquo;s accommodation office. </p>  <p>   In the case of privately-owned student accommodation, I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances that students find themselves.  There are, however, no powers available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action.  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.  In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached. If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board.</p></reply>

However, the beginning of semester 2 should give a clearer indication of these rates. Most Higher Education Institutions give students until the beginning of February to inform them of their intention not to continue with their course of study and therefore a better indication of non-progression rates will be available later in the semester.

My Department is monitoring developments in this regard very closely.</p><p>From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), and including the representative bodies of education providers and students to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of:</p><p>- teaching and learning, </p><p>- assessment, and </p><p>- qualifications. </p><p>This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements and methods of delivery, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p><p>In the case of Social Care, the awards standards in place for these qualifications reflect the accreditation criteria and placement requirements that have been set out by CORU, Ireland's multi-profession Health and Social Care Regulator and consequently the relevant PRB for this profession.</p><p>Since March 2020, QQI has facilitated engagement between members of the stakeholders group and CORU which have taken place in parallel to direct engagements between CORU and individual education providers. The goal of these engagements has been to ensure that, where possible, necessary alternative arrangements are in place to maintain the standards of education and training in this area and that these issues are actively managed. These efforts are to ensure that students can progress in their programmes from one academic year into the next, or, where relevant, graduate with the necessary professional competencies that have been set out by CORU. </p><p>While I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts that have been made by CORU, QQI and our educational institutions to identify and implement flexible solutions for students up to this point, I am conscious that further efforts are now necessary.</p><p>The current timing and the likely duration of Covid restrictions has created even greater disruption and uncertainty in this space than anticipated and has substantially impacted on the expected level of available social care placements.  It is in this context that I have asked QQI, supported by my Department, to facilitate intensified engagements between CORU, education providers and relevant stakeholders on this issue.  The focus of these engagements will be to identify solutions that can be swiftly implemented for the student cohort who are most impacted in the near term while also identifying flexible approaches that can be readily adopted within the system in the medium to longer term as the response to the pandemic evolves and changes. These engagements will facilitate a dialogue among stakeholders in developing these solutions and, most importantly, will ensure transparency and clarity for those students studying social care.  </p><p>Students should continue to engage directly with their provider for further information on the arrangements being implemented for their particular year and course.</p></reply>

Adaptations were made available by City and Guilds for year 2 students due to complete their qualification in 2020, and the FET institution arranged for students to complete these examinations outside of the institution. This concession was available following meetings with the awarding body, and the FET institution had to provide assurances and evidence that standards were being followed.  It was only available to year 2 students who were due to graduate in 2020 and examinations for year 1 students were postponed until the following academic year.   </p>  <p>  An examination timetable was prepared for the postponed year 1 examinations and given to students when they registered for year 2 of the programme commencing in autumn 2020.  I understand that all postponed examinations have taken place in accordance with the timetable. In January, a new timetable was prepared, and two examinations took place in January 2021, with the remaining examinations scheduled for March, April and May 2021. </p>  <p>  The FET institution must comply with the requirements of the awarding body, City and Guilds, which currently does not allow examinations for this course to be completed online.  The FET institution appreciates that many of their students are experiencing increased stress at present and are endeavouring to support them under very difficult circumstances.</p></reply>

My Department will oversee the implementation of the review through a steering group with student representation as well as representation from SUSI. It is intended that the review will commence shortly and will report to me in summer 2021.  Stakeholders will be consulted as part of the review process and it is intended that the future direction of the SUSI scheme will be guided by the outcome of the review. </p><p>The main support available to assist postgraduate students with the cost of attending higher education is the Student Grant Scheme and the Programme for Government committed to addressing the gap in postgraduate grants. From September 2021 the postgraduate fee grant will increase to &euro;3,500 from &euro;2,000. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and would give greater certainty for students in terms of supports. In addition the fee income threshold will increase to &euro;54,240 from &euro;31,500 from September 2021.</p><p>Under the Student Grant Scheme 2020, a student in receipt of a postgraduate research award where the stipend portion of the award does not exceed &euro;16,000 may apply to the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) for financial assistance under the Student Grant Scheme.  </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware that in July I announced a funding package of &euro;168m for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website </p><p>I recently announced enhanced funding of &euro;3.2 million for the Irish Research Council to better support postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers in Ireland across all disciplines. This will directly benefit close to 1,300 early-career researchers across our higher education and research system. The additional investment will fulfill the long-standing priority attached by the Council to improving the support for its funded postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers at the earliest opportunity. The Irish Research Council&rsquo;s postgraduate stipend will increase from &euro;16,000 to &euro;18,500 per annum and funding for its postdoctoral researchers is also increasing. The changes will benefit both existing and new Council awardees in 2021, effective from the beginning of January.  Since my appointment, the funding gap for postgraduate students and post-doctoral researchers between the research funding agencies under my Department has been an issue I wanted to address. I am pleased I have been able to address this as part of Budget 2021.</p></reply>

The &euro;250 grant is available automatically to everyone in full time third level education, including PLC courses, who avails of SUSI supports.  Nearly 72,000 students received their top-up before Christmas.  In some cases the payment will be made to registered students early this year, for example, if bank details were not submitted in time or if college registration is yet to be confirmed. There is no need to apply for it, and SUSI will be in touch with students.</p>  <p>  Students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions under the aegis of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in the State can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.  There is no need for students to apply for this funding and it is the intention that all students will have been contacted by their institution before the end of February.  </p>  <p>  In a small number of cases, alternative arrangements will be made for the payment of the monies to students.</p>  <p>  SUSI payments, including this once-off additional &euro;250 payment, are specifically exempt from tax.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners have advised the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science that the non-SUSI credit/payment is income for tax purposes but would not give rise to a tax liability for the majority of full-time students.</p>  <p>  The Covid Student Assistance Fund will provide financial assistance to all eligible full time third level students in recognition in recognition of the significant upheaval they have experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the options are designed to ensure students who are not in receipt of SUSI will benefit from the measure.</p>  <p>  This measure builds on the specific student supports in response to Covid, which I announced in July including the provision of additional student assistance including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education to assist with difficulties in accessing technology to facilitate their course work in a blended capacity.

If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board. </p><p>I am of course very conscious of the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students, financial assistance will be provided in academic year 202/21 to all students who avail of SUSI grants and to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state. </p><p>Under this initiative students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive a &euro;250 top-up in their grant and students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding student contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution.</p><p>Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative. In July I announced a range of additional student supports including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students.</p><p>The combined impact of these supports and initiatives highlight the strength of the Government's commitment to supporting students in meeting the costs of third level education.  </p></reply>

Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes.</p><p>Under the Department's Free Fees Initiative, the Exchequer pays tuition fees on behalf of eligible first time undergraduate students attending approved full-time undergraduate courses (including medicine courses). In order to qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative, students must meet the criteria of the scheme including previous education attainment.</p><p>Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. One of the recommendations of the Fottrell report (2006) was the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme (GEM). Students pursuing GEM programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. </p><p>However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes, and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the HEA. Currently, the subsidy is &euro;11,200 per student (2019/20 academic year) with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p><p>Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The total level of fees to be charged in the case of GEM fees are therefore solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.</p><p>There is no Department supported loan scheme in place for GEM students. There are various loans available for GEM students but these are private arrangements between the relevant lenders and the students applying for such loans and my Department has no role in such arrangements.</p><p>In terms of supports offered by institutions, HEIs may also offer financial support for students on such courses e.g. a  Atlantic Philanthropies-funded scholarship in UL for students who entered their undergraduate degree through an access route but this, along with overall admissions processes, is a matter for each HEI. </p><p>Students on graduate entry medicine courses may be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding.</p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, </p></reply>

This includes the consideration of issues around on-site access for practical work for students. The national co-ordination group for further and higher education is also meeting on a regular basis, and is closely monitoring the impact that Covid-19 is having on third level institutions and their students.</p><p>From the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, significant work has been undertaken by a stakeholder group chaired by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), and including the representative bodies of education providers and students to address issues relating to the maintenance of the quality and standards of:</p><p>- teaching and learning, </p><p>- assessment, and </p><p>- qualifications. </p><p>This group has focused on the implementation of alternative arrangements and methods of delivery, where appropriate and necessary, to meet both these standards and, where applicable, the educational accreditation criteria established by Professional Recognition Bodies (PRBs).</p><p>The government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business and Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021, Plan for Living with COVID-19, combined with the HSA Return to Work Protocols and ongoing Public Health advice, provide the over-arching framework for all sectors of society for the operation of their facilities and premises in keeping with public health advice.</p><p>Specific to further and higher education, the government has also published &ldquo;Guidance for Further and Higher Education for returning to on-site activity in 2020: Roadmap and COVID-19 Adaptation Framework for returning to on-site activity in autumn 2020&rdquo; accompanied by &ldquo;Implementation Guidelines for Public Health Measures in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)&rdquo; and outbreaks protocols developed in collaboration with experts within the higher education sector and with the Department of Health. This suite of guidance provides robust advice to higher and further educational facilities on COVID-19 prevention measures, implementation of which will minimise the risk of infection for all students and staff. Further and Higher Education Institutes should adapt and customise these recommendations for their own particular settings, adhering at all times to the overarching Public Health principles on which the guidance is predicated.</p><p>As Higher Education Institutions are autonomous, and as such are academically independent and are entitled to regulate their own academic affairs and administrative processes, including in relation to access to laboratory facilities, and as there are a wide range of courses with practical laboratory elements, students are encouraged to approach their institutions directly if they have any queries in relation to the lab-based elements of their course.  </p><p>However, my Department is continuing to work with all stakeholders to identify mitigating actions which can be implemented.</p></reply>

The European Commission has been engaged in work to examine what is possible given the current state of the pandemic across Europe.</p>  <p>  The European Commission approved the new work programme for Erasmus+ (2021-2028) in December 2020. The Higher Education Authority (HEA), which acts as the National Agency for the Erasmus+ Higher Education programme, is expecting to announce a call for applications to all participating Higher Education Institutions in March 2021. The HEA is working with the Sector to help it to benefit from the flexible approach proposed in the new Erasmus programme.  In response to suggestions to the European Commission made over a number of years, shorter duration mobilities and the use of blended modes of participation are now being introduced. These measures will help widen opportunities for learning mobilities in our higher education sector, but the ability to take these up will of course depend on the prevailing circumstances at the time. </p>  <p>  In 2021/2022, students and staff will have the opportunity to undertake a physical mobility to their chosen destination, depending on restrictions in place at at that time, should the circumstances surrounding international travel and the Covid-19 pandemic permit this. Students can also undertake a blended mobility approach, combining a period of physical mobility with a period of virtual learning. If international travel is not possible, students can do a virtual mobility for the entire duration of their Erasmus experience</p></reply>

If a student had already paid a deposit for accommodation or had incurred additional costs in advance of their departure, this will also be accepted as eligible for reimbursement provided evidence is given which indicates that this expenditure cannot be recovered. </p>  <p>  These measures are being managed by the Erasmus coordinators in the education institutions, and they will be able to offer guidance and assistance with any issues Erasmus students may be experiencing. </p></reply>

The rates of pay for the 25 craft apprenticeship programmes are agreed by the partners within the relevant sector, or are set out in Sectoral Employment Orders (Construction Sector and Mechanical Engineering Building Services Contracting Sector). Rates vary between occupations and sectors but in all cases craft apprenticeship rates are expressed as a proportion of the qualified rate, increasing yearly from 33% of the qualified rate in year one to 90% in year four. Payment is also based on attainment of relevant skill, knowledge and competence achieved after successfully completing each phase of training. The most up to date rates are at the following link.</p><p>ETBs pay a training allowance to craft apprentices undertaking periods of off-the-job training.  This training allowance is equivalent to the relevant agreed rate of pay and is paid in addition to either a travel or an accommodation allowance. For the period of off-the-job training, apprentices who have experienced a delay in their apprenticeship may be paid a training allowance at a rate which is one point higher than the rate normally assigned to that phase. This payment is in line with SOLAS internal procedures which govern apprenticeship operations and is currently being implemented across each Education and Training Board, Institutes of Technology, and Technological Universities. </p><p>The Department, SOLAS and the HEA are working closely with further and higher education providers around the country to add the maximum amount of training capacity possible.  Online learning and opportunities to step up the delivery of blocks of training are all being worked on with the objective of tackling the waiting lists and ensuring that apprentices complete their training as quickly as possible.</p><p>https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2021-02-03_pq542-03-02-21_en.doc</p></reply>

In overall terms, the sectors have rapidly adjusted to a more restrictive environment again, with all further and higher education institutions conducting the vast majority of their provision online. The balance between on-site and online provision has been subject to continuous change in order to safeguard students, staff and the communities in which institutions are located. Reflecting the recent deterioration in the Covid-19 situation, FET and HE providers are adapting and using their discretion to restrict onsite attendance further, only allowing the most essential work to take place onsite. Institutional and provider determinations regarding onsite activities are focused on activities that are not capable of being delivered through alternative means and are time-critical for students and learners during this period.</p>  <p>  There is a high level of autonomy in the sector and therefore it is not within my remit to determine assessment policies. However, I appreciate that the circumstances of this past year have been both challenging and stressful to students, and institutions are taking this into account in assessment design and implementation. At the same time, institutions must ensure that the assessment methods being used satisfy the requirements of professional or accrediting bodies, and external examiners, so that the integrity of the assessment process will not be compromised, thus maintaining confidence and transparency in the quality of the qualifications awarded.</p></reply>

The Protocol is intended to ensure strict precautions are taken to provide the highest standards of safety in the sales, lettings, valuations and managements of properties in the best interest of clients, consumers, employees, employers and those who are categorised as being at risk or at high risk of Covid-19.</p><p>This document gives detailed guidelines for consideration prior to arranging a viewing of a property, what happens during a viewing, post viewing tasks and what to do when a rental agreement is reached including: </p><p>- Confirm whether a respective client is cocooning or in an at risk category and if so, identify any additional precautionary measures that may be required.</p><p>- Agree with the owner/occupier that they will not be in the property at the time of viewing.</p><p>- Agree with owner/occupier and note all touch points in the dwelling for the property service provider (PSP) to sanitise after viewing (e.g. door handles, light switches etc.).</p><p>- Agree with owner/occupier the use of official Covid-19 signage at locations throughout the property to act as a useful reminder to viewers to follow the HSE rules.</p><p>- Pre-booked private appointment viewings only.</p><p>- Contact viewer(s) in advance to confirm booking and advise of controls in place and that HSE Covid-19 official instructions must be adhered to during viewings.</p><p>- PSPs should ask viewers to remain a reasonable distance from the property (e.g. remain in car) until given permission by the PSP to enter the property.</p><p>Following on from the Government's publication of the Plan for Living with Covid-19, the PSRA in association with IPAV and SCSI published the Property Services Providers Guidance to implementing the Plan for Living with Covid-19, which sets out additional measures to be undertaken at the different levels outlined within the Plan.  An updated version of this Guidance issued in January 2021 to take into account the enhanced restrictions in place.  This Guidance outlines that viewings by the public of properties for sale are permitted by appointment only where: </p><p>- The property has gone sale agreed and contracts for sale drafted.</p><p>In these circumstances, viewings by one party of two people from the same household is only permitted and properties must be unoccupied at the time of appointment.</p><p>The following arrangements apply for property for rent:</p><p>- Properties to be viewed online. </p><p>- No viewings in person permitted except: </p><p>- Where the potential tenant has been offered the property. Viewing of the property takes place prior to signing of the lease and payment of a security deposit. </p><p>- In emergency circumstances.</p><p>In these circumstances, viewings by one party of two people from the same household is only permitted.</p><p>Both the Protocol and the Guidance are subject to the Government, HSE and Department of Health guidelines on these matters.

They work in a challenging environment and deal with vulnerable people on a daily basis. Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. </p>  <p>  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with legislation. There are no provisions to apply different criteria depending on the category of employment of the applicant. All applicants are required to meet minimum periods of reckonable residence and standard checks are carried out as part of the overall process to maintain its integrity.</p>  <p>  Due to the restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic, I have provided six extensions of immigration permission to 20 April 2021, to ensure that those requiring an immigration permission to work in the state could continue to do so including those providing frontline services. </p>  <p>  I am conscious that a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during Covid-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented the holding of such ceremonies, which are usually attended by hundreds of people and which have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life.</p>  <p>  I was pleased to recently announce that a temporary system is now in place that will enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Under the temporary new system, up to 4,000 qualifying applicants will be asked to complete a statutory declaration that will be sent to them by email from the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service of my Department and bring it to one of the listed designated officials. The designated official must witness the applicant sign the statutory declaration. The applicant must then send the signed statutory declaration, the appropriate fee and any other requested documentation to Citizenship Division. Final processing will then take place and a certificate of naturalisation, will be sent to the applicant.</p>  <p>  The new system is in place from 18 January 2021, and my Department will communicate with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis over the next few months until in-person citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the 4,000 applicants currently waiting on naturalisation will have been provided with an opportunity to gain citizenship by the end of March. A significant number of healthcare and other frontline workers who have made extraordinary contributions during the pandemic will also benefit from these new arrangements over the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  It remains my intention that large scale ceremonies will recommence once circumstances allow. Since their establishment in 2011, citizenship ceremonies have been joyous occasions which mark the granting of Irish citizenships in a dignified manner and they have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life. In-person ceremonies have been provisionally scheduled to resume in December 2021, subject to the safety of all involved being assured.</p></reply>

This commitment is clearly directed towards the protection of the public and the regulator will have a major role in this regard.</p>  <p>  Work on the preparation of comprehensive new gambling legislation is underway in my department. That work will have regard to the recommendations in the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on the Future Licensing and Regulation of Gambling in Ireland, approved by Government in March 2019, and other relevant developments and reports. </p>  <p>  The Working Group Report recommends that the licensing and regulatory functions for all forms of gambling will be the responsibility of an independent gambling regulator which would be self-financing insofar as possible through fees and levies imposed on licensed gambling operators. </p>  <p>  A modern and effectively regulated gambling environment will ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that gambling will be a safe, fair and entertaining activity for the majority of those who choose to take part in it. It must provide enhanced consumer protection for players while limiting to the greatest extent possible the harmful effects on young people and those who may be susceptible to addiction.</p>  <p>  My predecessor hosted a major seminar on the future licensing and regulation of gambling at Farmleigh House in May 2019, bringing together a large number of interested and concerned stakeholders to discuss the Report of the Working Group and further developments. The next stage of engagement will take place following the publication of the General Scheme of the Bill later in the year.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for addiction treatment rests with my colleague the Minister of Health. </p></reply>

It is an offence under section 31(2) for a licensee to sell or deliver, or to permit any other person to sell or deliver, alcohol products to any person for consumption off his or her licensed premises by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, there is substantial existing legislation to regulate the delivery of alcohol services in Ireland. However, I do appreciate that, with the Covid-19 outbreak, habits of consumers have been affected and the share of purchases online has increased. These changes may be temporary or they may be the beginning of longer term trends. It is perhaps too early to tell what impacts these changes may have and whether increased online sales and delivery of alcohol will, on balance, provide increased convenience and choice to consumers or have negative impacts on society that require further regulation. I intend to keep the matter under review and will consider it further in the context of the wider reform of licensing law.</p></reply>

Both the Coroner and the Garda&iacute; provided any cooperation requested by the Commission during its work at the Tuam site. I understand that there is no active investigation being conducted into the Tuam discovery by the Garda&iacute; or by the Coroner. </p>  <p>  The Final Report of the Commission does not recommend any particular action on behalf of the Coroner with regard to the Tuam site. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will progress  the Certain Institutional Burials (Authorised Interventions) Bill which will provide for the establishment of a dedicated Agency, by Government Order under a sponsoring Minister for a specific site, to undertake where necessary, a forensic standard excavation, exhumation and, where possible, identification of discovered remains, and provide for their respectful reinterment. This legislation will support intervention at the Tuam site, and any other site, where intervention is reasonably required based on the manifestly inappropriate nature of the interments.</p>  <p>  This is a bespoke approach to address the very sensitive matter of the discovery of human remains at the Tuam site. It will effectively displace the relevant role of the Coroner, by disapplying the exhumation process provided in section 47 of the Coroners Act 1962. </p>  <p>  I support Minister O'Gorman in this approach and have assured him of the full cooperation of my Department and its Agencies in implementing the actions set out in the legislation.</p></reply>

Under these Regulations, passengers are legally required to produce evidence of a negative/not detected result from an RT-PCR Covid-19 test when boarding a ferry or aircraft and will be denied boarding by the carrier if they cannot produce such evidence unless they fall into the very limited exemption categories. </p>  <p>  Checks of evidence of a negative/not detected RT- PCR Covid-19 test on all arriving passengers into the State are carried out by Immigration Officials of the Border Management Unit of my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  at ports of entry to the State.

There have been 36,820 arrivals at Dublin Airport since 16 January, which equates to a referral rate of 0.41%.</p>  <p>  Passengers who arrive in an Irish port or airport without evidence of a negative/not detected test result or with a confirmed fraudulent test result will commit an offence and may be subject to prosecution, punishable by a fine not exceeding &euro;2,500 and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or both. In such cases An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will prepare a file for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p></reply>

In general, the current target is that it should take around 12 months for a standard application for a certificate of naturalisation to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. </p>  <p>  The average processing time for applications decided in 2020 was 13.5 months. To the end of September 2020, the top five nationalities making applications for citizenship in 2020, were the United Kingdom, India, Romania, Poland, Nigeria.</p>  <p>  For a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service.</p>  <p>  In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.   </p>  <p>  Additionally, a number of issues have impacted on the processing of citizenship applications over the past 15 months. A High Court case which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal resulted in significant delays. As well as this, a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during Covid-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented the holding of such ceremonies, which are usually attended by hundreds of people and which have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life.</p>  <p>  The combined impact of the Jones judgment and the Covid-19 disruption has resulted in the loss of over six months processing time.  As a result, the processing timeline for standard applications has increased to 12 months.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced that a temporary system is now in place that will help to significantly clear the backlog over the course of this year. The temporary system enables applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during Covid-19. The new system is in place from 18 January 2021, and my Department will communicate with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis over the next few months until in-person citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made regarding the number of protection orders, safety orders and barring orders granted by the courts in 2019 and 2020.</p><p>I am informed by the Courts Service that these statistics are compiled on an annual basis for the Courts Service Annual Report.  The 2019 Annual Report, which was published last July, is available on the Courts Service website at:</p><p><i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p><p>However, the 2020 figures will not be available until May, when they are compiled in preparation for the 2020 Annual Report later this year. The Court Service have undertaken to forward a combined table for both years by court area as soon as it becomes available.</p><p>From the outset of the pandemic, the Courts Service has prioritised urgent matters including domestic violence applications and this will continue. </p><p>Tackling domestic abuse and supporting victims is a key priority for my Department and for the Government as a whole.  This is true in terms of commitments and additional resources made available during the pandemic as well working collectively to put in place a comprehensive range of supports and services to meet the needs of victims of domestic abuse. Last March, in partnership with the NGO sector, we launched the &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo; awareness campaign, to ensure those at risk of domestic abuse throughout the pandemic are aware that supports remain available regardless of the level of restrictions in place. In October, I published Supporting A Victims Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases, which is a detailed roadmap for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the O'Malley review. A key action of the plan is to increase public awareness of the rights of victims of crime, and of the supports and services available to them. This will be done through the promotion of the Victims Charter, including by the redesign of the Victims Charter website, which will be launched shortly. </p><p>The Government is also committed to ensuring adequate resources for the courts in order to maintain access to justice for all citizens. This commitment was reinforced recently with the highest ever budgetary allocation for the Justice sector including &euro;158.8 million for the Courts Service. This included &euro;8 million for the new Courts Modernisation Programme along with an additional provision of &euro;5.7m for COVID measures to enable court sittings take place in a socially distanced and safe environment. A significant priority for my Department and the Courts Service in the years ahead will be to significantly invest in digital technology, to transform the experience of practioners and of court users.</p></reply>

It is currently against the law for any person (regardless of nationality or passport) to travel within Ireland for non-essential purposes and people can be fined for doing so. </p><p>As part of Government efforts to tackle the pandemic, new visa requirements have been introduced for passport holders from a number of South American countries and South Africa. The Order and the associated measures came into effect at midnight on 27 January 2021. The Immigration Service of my Department has also temporarily ceased accepting new visa/preclearance applications, with effect from close of business on 29 January 2021.</p><p>While it will still be possible to apply for an Irish visa/preclearance online in the normal manner, these temporary measures mean that applicants will not be able to complete their application process at this time. Any application made online will remain valid, until such time as restrictions are lifted. The Immigration Service intends to resume accepting applications as soon as safety concerns abate. </p><p>Certain Priority/Emergency cases will continue to be processed and these include the following:</p><p>- Workers or self-employed persons exercising critical occupations including healthcare workers, frontier and posted workers as well as seasonal workers as referred to in the Guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers during the COVID-19 outbreak;</p><p>- Transport workers or transport service providers, including drivers of freight vehicles carrying goods for use in the territory as well as those merely transiting;</p><p>- Patients travelling for imperative medical reasons;</p><p>- Pupils, students and trainees who travel abroad on a daily basis and Third-country nationals travelling for the purpose of 3rd level study;</p><p>- Persons travelling for imperative family or business reasons;</p><p>- Diplomats, staff of international organisations and people invited by international organisations whose physical presence is required for the well-functioning of these organisations, military personnel and police officers, and humanitarian aid workers and civil protection personnel in the exercise of their functions;</p><p>- Passengers in transit;</p><p>- Seafarers;</p><p>- Journalists, when performing their duties.</p><p>If an application falls into one of these categories, an application can be made online in the usual way. </p><p>Visa applicants are advised to monitor my Department's immigration website (www.inis.gov.ie) where a Frequently Asked Questions document on the impact of COVID-19 on immigration and international protection is available. This document is regularly updated. Additionally any person intending to travel should also take note of the General COVID-19 Travel Advisory issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs. </p><p>These measures are designed to support our public health restrictions on movement, including into and out of Ireland. I would like to repeat the strong advice from Government, is that everyone, regardless of their nationality or visa/preclearance status, or where they started from, who cannot provide proof of an essential purpose to travel to or within Ireland, should not travel to Ireland.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that training with regard to dealing with persons facing mental health emergencies is given to all Armed Support Units during their basic training. I am assured that this is a very detailed course on dealing with Hostage/Barricade/Suicide incidents and, by their very nature, the vast majority of which involve people experiencing mental health emergencies. This training is in co-operation with the Central Mental Hospital.</p><p>I am further assured that detailed training in dealing with situations of mental health emergencies is provided to all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including for those who are armed, as outlined as follows.</p><p><b>BA in Applied Policing</b></p><p>Garda Trainees during a Mental Health Training Module must research the area of mental health and how the Garda&iacute; will deal with the potential challenges faced when presented with an individual possibly suffering from a mental illnesses.</p><p>Since 2014, the HSE (National Office for Suicide Prevention) has been a stakeholder in providing training to Trainee Garda&iacute;.  Trainee Garda&iacute; undertake the two day internationally recognised ASIST workshop (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training), which is co-delivered with the HSE. The ASIST workshop is a suicide first aid programme which equips trainees with the skills required to discuss suicide with a person at risk and to make an intervention to reduce the immediate risk of suicide. During the two-day workshop, trainees have the opportunity to practice making an intervention with a person at risk of suicide through various role plays.  </p><p>Following this workshop, trainees also study legislation on the Mental Health Act 2001 and the procedures that are required if Garda&iacute; invoke their powers.</p><p>In addition, Garda Trainees participate in workshops during which they examine the area of vulnerability and minority groups and engage in a summative assessment whereby the trainees must engage in research regarding vulnerabilities amongst minority societal groupings. </p><p>The session culminates with the trainees making a presentation on the particular group which they have researched.</p><p><b>Sworn Members</b></p><p>All sworn members were also Trainee Garda&iacute; and have undergone the Foundation Training Programme.  In addition, as sworn members, they received training in relation to Interviewing Techniques which involve identifying and managing interviewee vulnerability.  As part of the interviewee vulnerability session, information is provided regarding identifying mental health and the implications of associated behaviours, depression, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia and strategies on how the interviewer can recognize potential issues and interact with such individuals. </p><p>As part of Custody Management training, the following modules are included for the management of mental health patients as prisoners:</p><p>- Mental Health,</p><p>- Self-Harm, and</p><p>- Excited Delirium, Drug and Alcohol abuse.</p><p>Also included in the training is an operational application of prisoner management (scenario based training).  There is a focus on subjects with mental health issues in these scenarios.</p><p><b>Continuous Professional Development</b></p><p>As part of the Continuous Professional Development Core Programme for operational members, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided training on Mental Illness Awareness in keeping with the Mental Health Act 2001.  The programme also covered areas of the types of mental illness, Garda powers and procedures and transportation of persons with a mental illness. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-03a.1650.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021020300079#WRW05500"><p>The Government is very conscious of the dangers presented by knife crime, and indeed all violent assaults. Clearly any stabbing has the potential to cause irreparable physical harm and tragic consequences and the Government is determined to ensure that similar problems to those which have developed in neighbouring jurisdictions do not develop here in Ireland. </p>  <p>  My Department is keeping the law in relation to sentencing for knife crimes, as well as all other policies around knife crimes, such as targeted interventions, under review.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including personnel matters and deployment of resources.  The allocation of Garda resources is made in light of identified operational demand, including deployment of personnel among Divisions.  As Minister, I have no direct role in this matter. I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review to ensure optimum use. </p>  <p>  I am advised that there is a dedicated Community Policing unit within the Dublin 17 area which works closely with local agencies and stakeholders, including Dublin City Council and local youth services. </p>  <p>  As of the 31st December 2020, the DMR North Region, which incorporates the area referred to by the Deputy, has a Community Policing strength of 26 members (4 Sergeants and 22 Garda&iacute;), as well as 7 Juvenile Liaison Officers (1 Sergeant and 6 Garda&iacute;). </p>  <p>  To date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. However, it is important to consider that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. Indeed, this is fundamental to the new Garda Operating Model recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and currently being rolled out under 'A Policing Service for Our Future', the Government's implementation plan for the Commission's recommendations.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an extended power of search without warrant for knives and offensive weapons and Garda&iacute; have secured a substantial number of convictions in the Courts in recent years for possession of a knife or other weapon. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are continuing with their proactive measures to tackle this issue, including their assault reduction strategy, under Operation Soteria, which is targeted at tackling all types of assaults in public, including use of knives. </p>  <p>  I am informed that there is an Inspector appointed in the Coolock District within the Dublin 17 area to oversee this operation, which involves the deployment of additional Garda patrols to areas affected by these incidents and monitoring the progress of live investigations with a view to ensuring offenders are brought to justice promptly. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also addresses knife crime through education and engagement with community initiatives. </p>  <p>  It is a key priority of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that victims of crimes where a knife/offensive weapon was used are offered the relevant victim services and support, whilst also being kept apprised on the status of an investigation. The proactive community policing implemented by local Garda management is essential in making communities more inclined to report such crimes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, especially when offenders are being prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that I will shortly be bringing to Government a new Youth Justice Strategy. The Strategy will strengthen and expand the role of the Garda Youth Diversion projects and other community-based initiatives, including those working with the Probation Service.  Bringing the full range of relevant interventions together in a coherent and holistic response to youth crime will support the objective of diverting young people from crime and anti-social behaviour, including knife crime.</p></reply>

The first window for accepting proposals ran from 14 May 2018 to 30 June 2018. Processing of the proposals from this first window was completed in 2018. A second window for the submission of proposals ran from 20 December 2018 until 8 February 2019. </p><p>The first IHAP round granted permission to 165 beneficiaries.

Therefore, I am satisfied that the existing laws of the State can cater for most if not all scenarios. Additionally, section 3(2) (a) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) provides that a deportation order may be made in respect of a person who has served or is serving a term of imprisonment imposed on him or her by a court in the State.  It is also important to point out that any person being considered for deportation, or indeed for a permission to remain in the State, will have their case considered under a variety of headings, all prescribed in law. </p>  <p>  Such factors to be considered will invariably include &lsquo;the character and conduct&rsquo; of the person both within and (where relevant and ascertainable) outside the State, including criminal convictions. This position is prescribed in both section 3(6)(g) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and section 49(3)(c) of the International Protection Act 2015. This assessment will have regard for whether the person in question has come to adverse Garda attention and any other matters of &lsquo;character and conduct&rsquo; which are material to the consideration of the individual case.</p>  <p>  Where a third country national has disrespected the laws of the State, it will certainly be a factor in consideration of their removal from the State, all other things being equal.</p>  <p>  In relation to people seeking international protection who commit a crime, this may or not be material to their international protection claim.  However, if a person commits a serious crime in their country of origin, this can form a basis for having them &lsquo;excluded&rsquo; from being declared a refugee or from gaining subsidiary protection status in the State. Nevertheless, any person seeking international protection who commits a crime in the State will have their protection application determined on its merits under domestic and international law. A person granted refugee status can also have their status revoked in certain prescribed circumstances, as set out in section 52 of the International Protection Act 2015. </p>  <p>  Permission to remain in the State is typically granted at the discretion of the Minister. Therefore, there is scope for having such a permission revoked, amended or not renewed, on grounds of criminality. Each case will be considered on its own merits and circumstances and fair procedures will be applied. However, it can be taken that the greater the sanction imposed by a Court in the State for a crime committed in the State, the greater the public interest will be in having their permission revoked, amended or not renewed and ultimately, following due process, having them removed from the State.</p></reply>

In his interim report, the Judge stated that he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation they wished to furnish to him in his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department recently received a letter from Judge Haughton updating the Department on his progress. In this correspondence, the Judge requested a further extension of the timeline to 1 March 2021, and set out a clear and detailed rationale for this extension.  I understand from Judge Haughton that he provided a copy of this letter to the O'Farrell family and I have also written to the family to inform them of the extension.</p>  <p>  The Judge is of course completely independent in his work, and as Minister I can neither intervene in nor direct the course of the scoping exercise. My Department has been and continues to provide all necessary assistance to the Judge to enable him to complete his work, and the extensions have, as the Judge has stated to the family, been necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the Judge's desire to be as comprehensive as possible in conducting the scoping exercise.</p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret this further delay, I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible and this requires additional time. With regard to any further extensions, the Judge is of course completely independent in his work on this scoping exercise, and I cannot intervene in the process, nor can I place any restrictions on the Judge. </p>  <p>  With regard to the passing of a D&aacute;il resolution in June 2018 calling for a public inquiry into the events surrounding the incident in which Shane O&rsquo;Farrell tragically lost his life, my predecessor as Minister initiated this scoping exercise to examine various matters. This is a reasonable and responsible approach to take. There are various precedents of scoping exercises being carried out prior to the setting up of inquiries or tribunals. A scoping exercise by a legal expert, to determine the net issues that might require further examination, is an exercise to ensure the success and completeness of any future action taken following the outcome of the scoping exercise.</p>  <p>  Judge Haughton has been in contact with the O&rsquo;Farrell family throughout his scoping exercise. I am awaiting Judge Haughton&rsquo;s final report to me on the outcome of his scoping exercise and I can assure the Deputy that his final report will be an important part of ensuring that outstanding questions are answered.</p></reply>

However, my Department is keeping the law in relation to sentencing for knife crimes, as well as all other policies around knife crimes, such as targeted interventions, under review.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the Garda&iacute; have secured a substantial number of convictions in the Courts in recent years for possession of a knife or other weapon. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently operating an Assault Reduction Strategy 2019-2021, which is targeted at tackling all types of assaults, including use of knives. This strategy is informed by a pro-arrest, early-investigation and proactive high-visibility approach. It places particular emphasis on prevention, education and awareness. The strategy promotes early prosecution of offenders where feasible and operationally appropriate.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also addresses knife crime through education and engagement with community initiatives.  </p>  <p>  At an operational level, I am informed that Garda&iacute; pro-actively target public disorder and anti-social behaviour, including knife-related crime, through the strategic deployment of Garda resources, and areas identified as public order hot-spots by local Garda management are the subject of additional foot and mobile patrols.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department will shortly publish a new Youth Justice Strategy which will look at ways to divert people away from crime.  The draft Strategy is currently being refined with reference to the outcome of public consultations and the views of key stakeholders and I expect to be in a position to present the finalised version to Government in the near future. </p></reply>

It is intended that the Bill will provide a robust statutory framework for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s use of recording devices and will ensure that necessary safeguards are in place in relation to data obtained through the use of any such devices.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  To date, 29 applications have been approved under the scheme, involving approved grants awarded totalling more than &euro;752,000.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  I can confirm that funding continues to be available for 2021.</p>  <p>  Last year the grant aid scheme was extended to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete.  Applicants can now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs. </p>  <p>  However in all cases, grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner. </p>  <p>  If the Minister of State is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website - www.justice.ie - and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address, fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie.</p></reply>

It is a crime prevention and harm reduction strategy that seeks to identify and address specific local community safety issues. Community safety can include issues relating to alcohol and substance abuse. </p><p>This policy will include the establishment of local community safety partnerships that will be responsible for developing a tailored and prioritised local community safety plan in conjunction with both the community and public services. The intention is to build the capacity of local residents to enable them to engage meaningfully in the local community safety partnership and grow local community leadership and participation. This will enable the local community safety partnership to function as a forum for dialogue between the community and service providers and strengthen trust in the people providing services.  </p><p>I expect that the community crime impact assessment tool with be of assistance to the local community safety partnerships.</p></reply>

The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013, on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts. </p>  <p>  In 2013, the Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly Mobility Allowance on an interim basis, to those who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the Scheme closed. Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there were 3,648 people in receipt of the interim payments at September, 2020. </p>  <p>  At the whole of Government level, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  Monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy is being overseen by the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which comprises key Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group.  </p>  <p>  Under the Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport and is committed to the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.   </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals for the provision of transport supports for people with disabilities. I intend to revert to Government with proposals in due course. Recent developments which will impact on the policy options include the following: </p>  <p>  - The ongoing progress by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in providing accessible public transport nationally and that Department's public consultation, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport;   </p>  <p>  - The Cost of Disability Study currently underway which was commissioned by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as part of Budget 2019.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs; and </p>  <p>  - The Working Group established under Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy by the Department of Justice and Equality which states that:- 'We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  - The review of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passenger (Tax Concessions) Scheme by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; the Revenue Commissioners Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-03a.1718.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021020300080#WRX04100"><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The Report of the NHSS Review published in 2015 identified a number of recommendations for immediate implementation and a number of other complex issues that were deemed to require more detailed consideration. One such recommendation was the need to undertake a review of the pricing mechanism used by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and,</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Group was established to oversee and manage the NTPF's pricing review. The Steering Group is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. There is considerable complexity in both the review and the potential scope of its implementation, which would interact with a broad range of policy initiatives and potential legislative developments that are taking place across the health and social care sectors. These complexities require a considered, integrated approach by the Department and its stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The Pricing Review was completed and some preliminary consideration of it was provided by the NTPF to the then Minister in late 2019. Given the complexities involved and the potential far reaching impacts, including in relation to access to care for citizens, it was determined that further briefing and consultation would be required before the Ministers could consider the range of issues and complexities involved.</p>  <p>  As the pandemic arose in early 2020, the Department has prioritised focus on supporting nursing homes and nursing home residents, noting the significant impact that COVID-19 has on such services and service users. A number of COVID-19 specific policy responses have been developed and implemented, including a Temporary Financial Support Scheme for private and voluntary nursing homes, which has paid out almost &euro;67m to date in respect of 2020 and made a further &euro;42m available up to the end of June 2021; supply of PPE on a free of charge basis; professional and expert advice, including clinical advice;  a series of serial testing programmes in nursing homes; access to a comprehensive package of training resources; redeployment of HSE staff to private nursing homes; and staff accommodation for nursing home workers. However, the importance of addressing long-term policy consideration with regard to the pricing mechanism is acknowledged. Minister Donnelly and I are currently considering the content of the review and the appropriate next steps. </p>  <p>  Separate to the pricing review, the Department of Health has proposed a specific policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to cap contributions based on family owned and operated farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. This change has been approved by Government and undergone pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family owned and operated farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood.</p>  <p>  Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I have exchanged letters with the Business Committee requesting a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. It is on the priority list for publication in the Spring legislative session.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus.  </p><p>The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.  </p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group will begin in February (subject to regulatory approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine).</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Family carers are a diverse group, therefore, each individual will be vaccinated in the group that is appropriate to them.</p></reply>

Practice nurses who are also registered midwives are able within their scope of practice to undertake antenatal care, provided they are competent to do so.</p>  <p>  The Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 recognises midwifery as a separate and distinct profession to nursing. There are no plans to amend the eligibility criteria for the payment of the practice nurse subsidy.</p>  <p>  The National Maternity Strategy represents a significant development in the delivery of national maternity policy that will fundamentally change how maternity care is delivered in Ireland. Implementation of the Strategy is being driven by the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme, which was established in the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services across primary, community and acute care.</p>  <p>  The Strategy is clear that midwifery led care should be expanded and enhanced. In that regard, Budget 2021 provides funding that will help to further develop community-based midwifery services and will see specific focus on enhanced midwifery care for women across the three pathways of care (Supported, Assisted &amp;amp; Specialised). As a priority, the development of community-based midwifery services will enable women to avail of care in the community, and at home, at the lowest level of complexity, reducing the requirement for attendance in acute hospital settings.</p></reply>

This is consistent with international best practice. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommend that nucleic acid amplification tests, such as RT-PCR, should be used to detect suspected, active SARS-CoV-2 infection. The advice of the WHO and the ECDC is available on their websites. For example, in its Technical Report &ldquo;Options for the use of rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK&rdquo;, published on 19 November 2020, the ECDC confirmed that &ldquo;To date, testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly relies on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on a nasopharyngeal specimen. This testing method remains the gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and is characterised by both high sensitivity and specificity in detecting viral ribonucleic acid (RNA).&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to monitor the evidence for other testing types in conjunction with other public bodies, such as the Health and Information Quality Authority (HIQA), and having regard to best international evidence and advice. On an ongoing basis, the National Public Health Emergency Team considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus.  </p><p>The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.  </p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group will begin in February (subject to regulatory approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine).</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in direct patient contact roles will be vaccinated in Group 2. This includes HCWs working in public, private, and voluntary settings. Other HCWs, not in direct patient contact, will be vaccinated in Group 4.</p></reply>

It requests laboratory professionals and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device (IVD) users to follow the instructions for use (IFU) when interpreting results for specimens tested using PCR methodology and reiterates the advice the it is a feature of the PCR test that means the clinical context of the test must also be taken into account.</p>  <p>  The HSE has adopted RNA PCR as the gold standard test for diagnosing Covid-19. This is consistent with international best practice. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommend that nucleic acid amplification tests, such as rRT-PCR, should be used to detect suspected, active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, for example, in its Technical Report &ldquo;Options for the use of rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK&rdquo;, published on 19 November 2020, the ECDC confirmed that &ldquo;To date, testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection mostly relies on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on a nasopharyngeal specimen. This testing method remains the gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2 and is characterised by both high sensitivity and specificity in detecting viral ribonucleic acid (RNA).&rdquo;</p>  <p>  This position remains unchanged and the WHO Information Notice Simply reminds the professionals involved in the analysis of samples using the rRT-PCR to follow manufacturer instructions. SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays in Ireland in use by the HSE and laboratories operating on behalf of the HSE are operated in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions and the CE marking for the assay.</p></reply>

Taxi regulation is a matter for the National Transport Authority who have published a range of support materials on their website.</p><p>The COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination. The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department and further information is available here: .</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE.</p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus.</p><p>The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group will begin this month.  </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>In relation to the use of taxi services to transport patients and samples, as this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly on this part of the question, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Terms of Reference also included giving due consideration to the circumstances of young people under the age of 25, targeting of high-risk groups, stigma reduction and mainstreaming period poverty mitigation measures across all relevant Government Departments and public bodies.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for Government 2020, makes the following specific commitment under &lsquo;Better Opportunities through Education and Research&rsquo; - &ldquo;Provide a range of free, adequate, safe, and suitable period products in all educational publicly-funded settings (including schools, colleges and HEIs), to ensure that no students are disadvantaged in their education by period poverty.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The NSWG Sub-Committee on Period Poverty submitted a report of its work at the most recent meeting of the NSWG Strategy Committee, held on December 9th, 2020. The Report is at design stage and it is envisaged that it will be launched in February. The report considers the need to legislate in Ireland for this matter.</p>  <p>  Two Private Members Bills on Period Poverty have been proposed recently. The Free Provision of Period Products Bill 2021 (Bill 4) has been proposed by Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee and sponsored by Senators Catherine Ardagh and Mary Fitzpatrick. An additional Bill, the Period Products (Free Provision) Bill, 2021 (Bill 2) has also been proposed, by Senators Rebecca Moynihan, Ivana Bacik, Annie Hoey, Marie Sherlock and Mark Wall.</p>  <p>  Bill 4 seeks to make period products available to everyone who needs to use them, free of charge.  The Bill also proposes that the Minister for Health may, by regulation, make a scheme to set out and regulate access to free period products by those who need access to such products. Bill 2 has similar aims, seeking to make period products freely available across all public facilities and through publicly funded services. </p>  <p>  A debate on the Free Provision of Period Products Bill, 2021, is currently scheduled in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 8th February, 2021. </p></reply>

These facilities will provide high volume, low complexity procedures on a day and outpatient basis, together with a range of ambulatory diagnostic services. The high volume of demand for such services in these major urban centres is sufficient to justify the construction of dedicated ambulatory centres.&rdquo; </p><p>The introduction of these dedicated elective/ambulatory sites is also in line with the recommendations of the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review and the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy (August 2018). </p><p>In 2019 the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office (SPIO) established an Elective Hospitals Oversight Group, under the joint governance of the Health Service Executive, Department of Health and Sl&aacute;intecare, to guide the development of the elective/ambulatory sites, as outlined in the National Development Plan (February 2018).</p><p>The Elective Hospitals Oversight Group has the following terms of reference:</p><p>1. To develop the elective hospital capacity with a ten-year horizon of need, which facilitates the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care.</p><p>2. To provide quicker, higher quality, safer care for selected, elective patients.</p><p>3. To create capacity for acute hospital sites and reduce/eliminate outlier boarding (trolleys).</p><p>4. To drive down waiting lists, both outpatient and inpatient/day case.</p><p>5. To reduce cancellations.</p><p>6. To reduce acute hospital footfall.</p><p>The provision of accident and emergency services is not within its terms of reference.</p><p>The Oversight Group is following the process outlined in the Public Spending Code. As required under the Code, a Strategic Assessment Report has been drafted for the development of Elective Hospital facilities. This sets out the rationale for investment, the alignment of the programme with strategic requirements of Government, some initial options and potential costs, and the governance of the programme. This document is complete and is currently going through the approval channels.</p><p>A high-level facilities spatial brief, including costs, a functional description and process flow, a site options appraisal and a Preliminary Business Case (PBC) in accordance with the public spending code is also under preparation.  The site option appraisal was carried out to explore indicative sites and was not a site selection process.</p></reply>

This includes planning for the safe resumption of drug and alcohol services, including community-based services, residential programmes and recovery support groups.</p>  <p>  In July 2020 the Department set up a working group with drug and alcohol service providers to develop a 'Framework for the Restoration of Drug and Alcohol Services', in a planned and appropriate manner in line with public health advice. The working group has identified issues on which guidance and supports are required. The Framework document is being updated to reflect the latest level 5 plus restrictions.</p>  <p>  In response to the issues identified by the working group, the Department provided once-off funding of &euro;480,00, in November 2020. This funding was aimed at supporting the restoration of drug and alcohol services including the adaptation of services, premises, online meetings and personal protective equipment.</p>  <p>  This funding was allocated to the network of 24 Drug and Alcohol Task Forces for distribution to community and voluntary drug and alcohol services in their areas. Each task force could apply for up to &euro;20,000 in once-off funding to meet Covid-19 related costs.</p>  <p>  The working group will report on the impact of this funding on drug and alcohol services in the near future. The report will help to assess if further funding is required. </p>  <p>  I have asked officials to keep me informed on progress on this important issue. I will be advised by the working group, in due course,  on whether further financial supports are required on this issue. </p></reply>

This platform is deployed in acute hospitals, the NVRL and HSE&rsquo;s commercial partners. At present, the HSE has been able to provide adequate PCR testing for identified priorities in response to the very significant demand.</p>  <p>  While rapid Antigen Detection Tests (ADTs) are described as rapid, and simple to perform, they are not designed to be delivered in large numbers and there are considerable human resource, operational, quality assurance, and clinical governance considerations in their administration. To date, validation work indicates that ADTs are most effective in detection of symptomatic cases, when symptom onset is within the last 5 days and when the likelihood of test positivity is greater than 10% among the target population. Validation studies, both here in Ireland and in Europe are showing significant disparities in test performance (particularly in relation to sensitivity) versus some manufacturer claims, with tests not meeting minimum performance requirements set by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Furthermore, their intended use is typically in symptomatic individuals in the early stages of infection, where samples are taken and tests conducted by trained health professionals. There is limited performance data currently available for the use of antigen tests in asymptomatic populations. The studies also show that performance in symptomatic individuals is much better than in asymptomatic individuals where data are available.</p>  <p>  The NPHET (National Public Health Emergency Team) considers the use of ADTs on an ongoing basis and has endorsed recommendations on the use of ADTs that have been validated as a supplement to PCR testing in certain situations, and particularly when the availability of PCR tests may be limited.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently putting in place deployment options for the use of ADTs for specific indications in the acute hospital setting and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting in symptomatic vulnerable populations and their close contacts, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from ADTs undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken to date to evaluate the use of ADTS in an Irish context and this will continue on an ongoing basis due to the role they can have in the national testing strategy. In particular, further setting-specific ADT validation work continues to be undertaken by the HSE. Antigen testing will not, however, replace the requirement for large scale PCR testing which remains the gold standard for community testing.</p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>Vaccine allocation is a matter for my Department  and further information is available here: .</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE.</p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>The next group to be vaccinated (Group 3) are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group will begin in February (subject to regulatory approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine).</p><p>Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in direct patient contact roles will be vaccinated in Group 2. This includes HCWs working in public, private, and voluntary settings. Other HCWs, not in direct patient contact, will be vaccinated in Group 4.</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

The guideline is based on best research evidence, in conjunction with clinical expertise and patient preferences, and was developed using a clear evidence-based methodology that is used  internationally.</p>  <p>  The overall objectives of the National Clinical Guideline on Ovarian Cancer are:</p>  <p>- to improve the quality of clinical care, improving patient outcomes by reducing morbidity and mortality;</p>  <p>- to reduce variation in practice and improve consistency and standards of care by promoting interventions of proven benefit - and discouraging ineffective ones; and</p>  <p>- to address areas of clinical care with new and emerging evidence.</p>  <p>  The HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) works to ensure strong focus on early detection, including through development and delivery of public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives for healthcare providers and community organisations.</p>  <p>  With regard to the use of  Niraparib (Zejula&reg;) as a treatment for ovarian cancer, the HSE has a standard assessment process in place for the approval of the reimbursement of new drugs, and new indications for existing drugs. This process is intended to arrive at decisions on the funding of drugs that are clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. The reimbursement process is underpinned by the Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines (2016), and the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.</p>  <p>  Before a medicine is licensed for use in the European Union, and before it can be marketed for sale in the EU, it must receive a market authorisation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Once drugs are licensed, the company may apply for HSE reimbursement approval using the standard process outlined above.</p>  <p>  Niraparib (Zejula&reg;) is a Poly polymerase inhibitor (PARPi).  These are a novel class of anti-cancer therapies.  Niraparib (Zejula&reg;) is currently being considered in line with the HSE reimbursement process. Ahead of the conclusion of this process, the reimbursement of Niraparib is not approved for reimbursement by the HSE.</p></reply>

This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources are made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work.</p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of December 2020 there were 4,095 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,440 in December 2018.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an Access to Care Fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and &euro;30m to the NTPF for the provision of treatment as required in both private and public hospitals in order to address capacity issues in acute hospitals and waiting lists. </p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are continuously reviewing waiting lists with a view to ensuring that services for scheduled care are resumed as soon as it is deemed safe to do so in line with HSE clinical guidelines.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. </p><p>The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>The next group to be vaccinated are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group will begin in February (subject to regulatory approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine).  </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

The first is the automated deduction of union subscriptions. The second is that the HSE does not engage in negotiations with the PNA or does it recognise the PNA as representing ambulance personnel. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the HSE deducts subscriptions at source for those ambulance staff that are members of a number of unions. These are SIPTU, FORSA and UNITE. The deduction of subscriptions is not a legal right but rather a concession granted to recognised unions. </p>  <p>  NASRA, is a group which is not recognised by the HSE and, therefore, does not have negotiating rights.  The PNA does not have negotiating rights for ambulance personnel.  It is not possible to negotiate with a union which is not recognised as having negotiating rights for ambulance grades.  </p>  <p>  Industrial relations policy has had a long-standing objective of avoiding fragmentation in worker representation in public sector employments, and the trade union movement generally, to facilitate the orderly conduct of bargaining and other aspects of industrial relations.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have engaged with HSE management in the past to explore ways forward to see if a resolution to the dispute can be progressed.  These discussions have taken place, but an appropriate solution has yet to emerge.  </p>  <p>  On that basis, the fact remains that the PNA does not have negotiating rights for ambulance grades and hence the HSE cannot negotiate with them in respect of this group.</p></reply>

In addition, there is no accepted standardised way of measuring breast density or international guidance to be given to women and no specific action that can be taken. </p>  <p>  The NSS and BreastCheck monitor new research regularly to review for any potential changes or improvements that can be made: however, the situation in relation to breast density is not expected to change in the foreseeable future.</p>  <p>  It is important to understand that breast screening does not prevent breast cancer. However, it helps to find breast cancer at an early stage.  A small number of cancers cannot be found by a mammogram, but attendance for regular screenings means that many changes can be found as early as possible.</p>  <p>  It is also important to emphasise that BreastCheck is a screening service for otherwise well women with no symptoms.  Any woman, regardless of age or eligibility with BreastCheck, who has any concerns relating to their breast health should contact their GP immediately to discuss their concerns.</p>  <p>  Any proposed future changes to national population-based screening programmes will be assessed by the National Screening Advisory Committee, which was established in 2019. The Committee&rsquo;s role is to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly.  </p>  <p>  The addition of any new population-based screening programmes, or modifications to existing programmes, will be incorporated as part of the Committee's work programme following a robust, methodologically sound and detailed analysis of the evidence in each and every case against internationally accepted screening criteria.</p></reply>

One of the first tasks of the NIMC, in conjunction with the HSE Implementation Group, will be to ascertain ongoing Sharing the Vision aligned tasks and projects. This work is very much at an early stage. To date, the Steering Committee has met twice, on 11 December 2020 and on 15 January 2021, with meetings scheduled to take place monthly. The minutes of the Steering Committee meetings are available on the Department of Health Website.</p>  <p>  In these early stages, the Steering Committee will focus on developing and establishing the structures and processes crucial to a full and successful implementation of the new policy.  I am satisfied that the Committee is progressing well in this initial stage of its work, by building on the following initiatives already underway:  </p>  <p>  - Many significant recent developments in online mental health service provision and positive mental health promotion have been expedited in the advent of COVID-19. These initiatives exemplify the holistic, whole-of-population approach to mental health service development that Sharing the Vision will be promoting and seeking to advance, in parallel with the development of specialist supports.</p>  <p>  - Sharing the Vision recommends the continued implementation of the existing National Clinical Programmes in mental health, including Dual Diagnosis, Early Intervention in psychosis, and Mental Health and Intellectual Disability, by specifying the need for their continued phased implementation and evaluation. The Clinical Programmes are at the heart of service improvement, providing clear pathways in addressing a number of mental health conditions, to ensure strategic, standardised, and evidence-based delivery of services and better outcomes for service users and their families. The Clinical Programmes are currently in various stages of design and implementation. </p>  <p>  - Furthermore, to address the issue of funding, I secured an additional &euro;50 million for mental health services in 2021, bringing the annual budget to &euro;1,076 billion. &euro;23 million of this is dedicated to commencing implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision.  This includes establishing the new structures required to implement the policy, and the expansion of the clinical care programmes outlined above.</p>  <p>  - It will also fund additional mental health bed capacity, enhanced resources for Community Mental Health Teams, CAMHS Hubs/Teams, Adult Crisis Resolution Services, increased supports in employment, Peer Support Workers, Bereavement Co-ordinator, and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, which are specific short term recommendations in the new Policy. Work is progressing in these areas, including the recruitment of the 153 new mental health staff provided for, through 2021 development funding. </p>  <p>  - Sharing the Vision additionally recommends that, in keeping with the evolving understanding of human rights to empower people and improve quality of care in mental healthcare facilities, legislation must be updated, and additional supports put in place. As the Deputy may be aware, this is currently being addressed in the review of the Mental Health Act, 2001 which is undergoing a major overhaul, with draft heads of the new bill expected to be published in the very near future.</p></reply>

These facilities will provide high volume, low complexity procedures on a day and outpatient basis, together with a range of ambulatory diagnostic services. The high volume of demand for such services in these major urban centres is sufficient to justify the construction of dedicated ambulatory centres.&rdquo; The NDP does not make specific provision for a new acute hospital in Cork.</p><p>The introduction of these dedicated elective/ambulatory sites is also in line with the recommendations of the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review and the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy (August 2018).</p><p>In 2019 the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office (SPIO) established an Elective Hospitals Oversight Group, under the joint governance of the Health Service Executive, Department of Health and Sl&aacute;intecare, to guide the development of the elective/ambulatory sites, as outlined in the National Development Plan (February 2018).  </p><p>The Elective Hospitals Oversight Group has the following terms of reference: <ol type="1"><li>To develop the elective hospital capacity with a ten-year horizon of need, which facilitates the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care.</li> <li>To provide quicker, higher quality, safer care for selected, elective patients.</li><li>To create capacity for acute hospital sites and reduce/eliminate outlier boarding (trolleys).</li><li>To drive down waiting lists, both outpatient and inpatient/day case.</li><li>To reduce cancellations.</li><li>To reduce acute hospital footfall.</li> </ol>The provision of accident and emergency services is not within its terms of reference. </p><p>The Oversight Group is following the process outlined in the Public Spending Code. As required under the Code, a Strategic Assessment Report has been drafted for the development of Elective Hospital facilities. This sets out the rationale for investment, the alignment of the programme with strategic requirements of Government, some initial options and potential costs, and the governance of the programme. This document is complete and is currently going through the approval channels.</p><p>A high-level facilities spatial brief, including costs, a functional description and process flow, a site options appraisal and a Preliminary Business Case (PBC) in accordance with the public spending code is also under preparation.  The site option appraisal was carried out to explore indicative sites and was not a site selection process. </p></reply>

This was following a request from the HSE and a recommendation to me from the Chief Nursing Officer in my Department. The HSE asked for student placements to be deferred for at least two weeks so that more experienced, qualified nurses could be freed up to deal with the presenting surge. Ordinarily, these senior nurses are part of the infrastructure that helps support/oversee these student placements.</p><p>Last week the number of patients in hospitals receiving critical care remained exceptionally high. In addition, a significant number of staff across the whole system were absent on COVID-19 leave. These factors combined meant that the necessary staff to support clinical placements were not yet available to return to these roles. Therefore, it was not possible to resume 1<sup>st</sup>to 3<sup>rd</sup>year supernumerary clinical placements on Monday 1 February 2021. However, intern and 4<sup>th</sup>year supernumerary placements continue uninterrupted. </p><p>I  fully understand and regret that the necessary decision to suspend placements has been a cause of concern to students. Continuation of  education, in the supportive environment it requires, is paramount, and placements will be resumed as soon we can be confident that the appropriate infrastructure is in place to support this..</p><p>The Chief Nursing Officer has been in regular contact with all students via their colleges and wrote to students on Friday 29 January, 2021 to inform them of the latest decision and  assure them that,  my Department continues to work with the Higher Education Institutions, the NMBI ( the regulator) and  the HSE to reduce the effect the delay in resumption might have for students in progressing through their programme of education.</p><p>All relevant information is currently being analysed and a decision regarding resumption of placements will be made imminently. Following this, the Chief Nursing Officer will issue a further update to all students.</p></reply>

Failure to submit correct documentation is the most common cause of delays in processing applications and every effort is made by CORU to ensure applicants submit the information required to allow for the smooth processing of their application.  CORU also advises that there are some applications for existing practitioners who applied under the grand parenting route that are in a queue for processing.  However, these applicants are entitled to use the protected title while their application is being processed.  Where applications are received with all required documentation, CORU endeavours to process these applications, including eVetting, within 14 weeks; with many applications, in particular those of graduates within the State, completed in a much shorter timeframe. </p>  <p>   Further to the information already provided to the Deputy, CORU has confirmed that the average processing time for new applications over the past 6 months is 10 weeks, and CORU continues to actively engage with existing practitioners awaiting registration to ensure that the necessary documentation for a complete application for registration is received.  I have asked CORU for information regarding number of applications on hand, and will revert to the Deputy in due course. </p></reply>

The Department of Health, the HSE, and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), together with the makers of medicines, wholesalers and pharmacists, continue to monitor the supply of medicines to Ireland closely. The processes and systems to mitigate against any Brexit related issues are functioning well and are kept under constant review by each agency. As part of this coordinated response, all stakeholders continue to develop approaches and implement contingencies to address any identified concerns should they arise.</p>  <p>  Although a limited number of individual suppliers and logistics companies have required some initial assistance in understanding and complying with the customs requirements that arose as a result of Brexit, such issues have been resolved in a timely manner, with the assistance of Revenue Customs, and have not reoccurred with subsequent deliveries.   </p>  <p>  Arising from detailed and ongoing engagement with the pharmaceutical industry and wholesalers which began in early 2019, there is no evidence to suggest that Ireland is likely to face general medicines supply issues, now or in the near future, as a result of any potential delays in the supply chain due to Brexit. This is also supported by a refresh of previous assessments that were recently undertaken to obtain assurances that all the necessary preparations have been taken by all stakeholders before the end of the transition period and to ensure the resilience of the medicines supply chain into the future.   </p>  <p>  Unlike the UK supply chain, there are additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicines supply chain. The pharmaceutical industry and wholesalers have provided direct assurances that they are confident they have sufficient stocks to bridge any initial issues at ports. However, medicines shortages inevitably arise from time to time and are a feature of health systems around the world. The potential shortage of any specific medicine will be managed through the existing Medicine Shortages Framework to prevent the shortage from occurring where possible or, where it does occur, to manage the impact in terms of identifying alternative treatments.  </p>  <p>  In the case of medicines used most often in Ireland, there are typically multiple forms, strengths, brands, and generic medicines available from a range of sources. In the event that there are some supply issues for individual medicines, it is expected that alternative options such as alternative strengths, brands and generic medicines will be available to ensure continuity of treatment. If a patient has any concerns about their medicine, they are encouraged to speak with their pharmacist or GP. </p>  <p>  Ireland is unlikely to face general medicine supply issues and is well placed to deal with these as they arise. However, this is very much based on the normal use of medicines. There is no need for healthcare professionals to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions. Similarly, patients and the general public are asked not to seek supplies of medicines over and above their normal requirements. Doing so will disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for others.</p></reply>

This open engagement continues and we will continue to work with all key stakeholders to ensure that patients in Ireland have access to the medicines they need.    </p>  <p>  It is important to note that irrespective of Brexit, medicines can continue to be sourced from the UK where needed for individual Irish patients. The Department of Health, HPRA and the HSE have been carefully monitoring the supply of medicines from the UK since the end of the Brexit transition period. Although a limited number of individual suppliers and logistics companies have required some initial assistance in understanding and complying with the customs requirements that arose as a result of Brexit, such issues have been resolved in a timely manner, with the assistance of Revenue Customs, and have not reoccurred with subsequent deliveries.   </p>  <p>  Medicine shortages are, unfortunately, a feature of both the global and the Irish market, regardless of Brexit. However, Ireland has an existing multi-stakeholder medicine shortages framework in place, co-ordinated by the HPRA, to help prevent shortages from occurring and to reduce the impact on patients and healthcare professionals by co-ordinating the management of potential or actual shortages as they arise.   </p>  <p>  More generally, because of all stakeholders' preparatory work, general medicine supply issues are not anticipated as a result of Brexit.

Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to provide an eligibility assessment process that is responsive and sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.

COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The various limits at all levels in the Government's Plan are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.  The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET),  by my Department and by the Government . The measures in place and the public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p><p>At Level 5, Religious services can be carried out online.  Guidance for religious services can be found at:- .  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has also produced guidance on Religious Services and it is available at:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>At level 5, up to 6 guests, including children of all ages, can attend a wedding ceremony and reception, irrespective of the venue. This 6 does not include the persons getting married or persons attending in a professional capacity. Guests are permitted to travel to attend the wedding and a minister of religion or priest is permitted to travel to conduct wedding services.  Details of the public health measures currently in place for weddings can be found at:-<i></i>. With regard to domestic travel at Level 5, people are required to stay at home except for travel for work, education or other essential purposes. Details of public health measures in place for domestic travel  including essential purposes can be found at: <i>.</i></p><p>You may also wish to note that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has provided guidelines for the hospitality industry which includes guidance on weddings and is available at: - <i></i></p></reply>

The work of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board is significantly more challenging than for registration boards for some other professions, owing to the different and complex entry paths into these professions, the variety of titles used and the variety and number of courses and course providers.  </p>  <p>  The Board is now undertaking the substantial work required to open the registers for counsellors and psychotherapists.

Given the complexity of this work there is not yet a date for the opening of the registers.</p>  <p>  With regard to access to counselling services in the community, in line with Sl&aacute;intecare, Sharing the Vision envisages an increasing role for the primary care sectors which, if appropriately resourced and with appropriate governance, can provide a comprehensive range of interventions. A core component of this is increasing access to counselling and talk therapies. </p>  <p>  Recommendation 16 of Sharing the Vision proposes that access to a range of counselling supports and talk therapies in the community/primary care sector should be available on the basis of identified need so that all individuals, across the lifespan, with a mild-to-moderate mental health difficulty can receive prompt access to accessible care through their GP/Primary Care Centre. Counselling supports and talk therapies must be delivered by appropriately qualified and accredited professionals. Recommendation 31 proposes that the potential for digital health solutions to enhance service delivery and empower service users should be developed.</p>  <p>  With regards to implementation, the recently established National Implementation Monitoring Committee (NIMC) for Sharing the Vision will oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the policy and monitor progress.  The NIMC is supported by a Reference Group of Service Users and Families and the NIMC Specialist Groups.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also establishing an implementation group, one of the first tasks of which will be to ascertain ongoing Sharing the Vision aligned tasks and projects.</p>  <p>  With regards to ongoing HSE projects aligned to Sharing the Vision, HSE Mental Health commenced a service improvement project in January 2018 to ensure greater consistency and equity of access to talk therapies, with a view to developing a Model of Care for adults who attend specialist mental health services accessing talking therapies. While the project focuses specifically on adults attending specialist mental health services, it also describes other services where talk therapies are currently provided from HSE funding. </p>  <p>  Building on a stepped care approach, the Model of Care is expected to involve an assessment of the need for talking therapies taking into account stakeholder perspectives and the prevalence of mental health difficulties within the adult population. It will consider evidence-based talking therapies best-suited to meet the identified needs and outline a recommended operational model for talking therapies provided by General Adult Community Mental Health Teams. </p>  <p>  Of course, it is important to recognise that the development of any recommended operational model would be a substantial and complex process, with numerous steps and issues to be worked through, as appropriate. </p>  <p>  Finally, many significant recent developments in online mental health service provision have been expedited in the advent of Covid 19. These initiatives are early and necessary examples of the sort of holistic, whole of population approach to mental health service development that Sharing the Vision will be promoting and seeking to advance, in line with the development of specialist supports.   </p></reply>

HIF Round 1 ran from 2017-2018; Round 2 from 2018-2019 and Round 3 (current round) runs from 1<sup>st</sup>July 2019 to 31<sup>st</sup>December 2021.</p><p>The Fund is currently structured on the basis of supporting national and local organisations and to deliver actions aligned to the Government&rsquo;s Healthy Ireland Framework via two specific strands: Strand 1 (local organisations) &amp;amp; Strand 2 (national organisations). </p><p>- Strand 1 provides funding to local authority led Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) and T&uacute;sla Children and Young People Service Committees (CYPSCs). </p><p>- Strand 2 provides funding to a small number of national organisations to support larger scale nationwide programmes (Age Friendly Ireland, Local Government Management Agency and Mayo Education Centre).</p><p>This currently involves providing funding under the Healthy Ireland Fund (Round 3) to 53 grantees.</p><p>The amount of funding allocated to each Local Authority in each Round of Healthy Ireland so far &ndash; Round 1 September 2012 &ndash; June 2018 &euro;3,516,253; Round 2 July 2018 &ndash;June 2019 &euro;3,093,033; Round 3 July 2019 &ndash; December 2020 &euro;7,136,850. Total HIF funding to Local authorities to date has been &euro;13,746,136.</p><p>In Round 1, &euro;3,205,429.35 was expended and &euro;310,823.65 returned by Local Authorities.  In Round 2, &euro;2,742,067.20 was expended and &euro;175,988.87 was returned by Local Authorities.  As HIF Round 3 is currently ongoing, all funding for the programme is still available to the groups so there are no amounts returned at this point under Round 3.</p><p>Please note that Healthy Ireland doesn&rsquo;t currently allow any funding to be carried forward from one Round to the next. As a result, any unspent funds or ineligible spend amounts must be returned to Pobal before the Local Authority can receive the bulk of their funding under the next Round. The Healthy Ireland Fund rounds do not run in line with the calendar year so it is not possible to separate the closed rounds into 2017, 2018 and 2019 as they run mid-year to mid-year.</p><p>HIF is mainly focused on the delivery of education, awareness raising and community development initiatives linked to the promotion of health and wellbeing.  HIF does not fund any large-scale infrastructure projects. However, small scale capital works are permitted where it can be demonstrated that the capital works e.g., small-scale refurbishment, building work, pathway development etc. is essential for the delivery of the action. Under HIF Round 3, these costs cannot exceed &euro;7,500 per action.</p><p>From an oversight perspective, all HIF Grantees are required to report on progress and spend every 6 months against agreed actions, including any small-scale capital works.  This information is reviewed by Pobal staff and follow-up is conducted where necessary, including site visits where needed to verify progress. In addition, Pobal carries out audits of a sample of HIF Grantees to verify spend.</p></reply>

Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on the 17 January 2020 that a HTA was not recommended and that Dupilumab not be considered for reimbursement for this indication at the submitted price.</p>  <p>  The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the company in February 2020 regarding both the adult and adolescent populations.</p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members and clinicians.</p>  <p>  The final HTA report and NCPE recommendations concerning Dupilumab were reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of the commercial negotiations, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE Drugs Group considered all the evidence and gave a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) not to support reimbursement of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that the applicant company was issued with notice of the proposed decision of the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement on 21 August 2020.  On 18 September 2020, the applicant company submitted representations with respect to these applications.</p>  <p>  The HSE reviewed these representations, as is required in such circumstances under the 2013 Health Act, and engaged in a meeting in November 2020 with the applicant company to discuss the submission.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the HSE Drugs Group, having reviewed the above representations at their January 2021 meeting, supported reimbursement of Dupilumab for the following defined subgroup of the full licensed indication: moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in refractory adults and adolescents 12 years and older for whom immunosuppressant treatment has failed, or is not tolerated or is contraindicated.</p>  <p>  The HSE has further advised that the HSE EMT received this recommendation and has supported the reimbursement of Dupilumab under High Tech Arrangements, subject to the implementation of a managed access programme and the restriction of reimbursement to the defined subgroup which was recommended by the HSE Drugs Group.</p>  <p>  Processes required to implement the managed access programme are currently ongoing with a view to formalising the approval for reimbursement of Dupilumab.   </p></reply>

Low certainty or very low certainty evidence was identified in relation to a small number of interventions.

Checks are made by border officials upon arrival and those that do not present a test result are committing an offense. </p>  <p>  Extra precautions have been taken in relation to arriving travellers from countries with emerging variants of concern. All arrivals from Great Britain, South Africa or any country in South America have been advised to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival to Ireland and encouraged to avail of a free-PCR test through a GP. </p>  <p>  New substantial quarantine measures have been announced by Government which will require all international travellers to complete a period of mandatory quarantine upon arrival.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-02-03a.2424.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021020300089#WRGG02000"><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has been designated as a body authorised to negotiate with proprietors of non-HSE registered nursing homes to reach agreement in relation to the maximum price(s) that can be charged for the provision of long-term residential care services to NHSS residents. The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function and negotiates with a nursing home on an individual basis. The Minister for Health does not have any role in this regard.</p>  <p>  The price agreed with the NTPF covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the </p>  <p>  - Bed and board</p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living</p>  <p>  - Laundry service</p>  <p>  The amount that a resident pays as their contribution to care is individual to that resident and is calculated based on the financial assessment of their means only.</p>  <p>  However, although the NHSS covers core living expenses as above, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers, hairdressing, and some therapies. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people. The guidelines set out the obligations and responsibilities that providers must adhere to under consumer protection law and are aimed at providing greater transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers.</p></reply>

The potential benefits of energy efficiency measures include improved physical health such as reduced symptoms of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, rheumatism, arthritis and allergies, as well as fewer injuries. In cold climates, energy efficiency improvements can lower rates of excess winter mortality.</p>  <p>  Recent evidence shows that chronic thermal discomfort and fuel poverty also have negative mental health impacts (anxiety, stress, and depression). Energy efficiency improvements targeting fuel poverty can therefore improve mental, as well as physical well-being. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to providing &euro;5 billion to part fund a socially progressive national retrofit programme targeting all homes, but with a particular focus on the Midlands region and on social and low-income tenancies. Budget 2021 provided &euro;109 million to support lower income households to retrofit their homes and participate in the transition.  This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation for energy poverty schemes and means that almost half of the total residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty.</p>  <p>  The Warmth and Wellbeing scheme is a major pilot initiative delivered under the Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty and the Healthy Ireland Framework.  This pilot scheme, which was launched in 2016 with a &euro;20m investment, is led by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in collaboration with the Department of Health, and has been delivered by the HSE and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) in HSE Community Healthcare Organisation 7 (CHO7). </p>  <p>  The scheme has targeted deep energy efficiency interventions at people in energy poverty who are suffering from acute health conditions and living in poorly insulated homes. By retrofitting homes, the Warmth and Wellbeing pilot scheme aims to improve their internal air temperature and air quality, producing an improved quality of life for residents, reducing their energy bills and reducing impact on the health service through less frequent doctor/hospital visits.</p>  <p>   An independent research project will take place in 2021 with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), following standard procurement processes. The LSHTM research team will conduct a health impact evaluation of the scheme, and will be delivered in 2021. This research will examine, among other matters, changes in hospitalisation rates and medication usage, general wellbeing and mental health and overall improvements in quality of life. </p>  <p>  Research outcomes are expected to inform wider rollout of retrofit schemes in Ireland. </p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. </p><p>The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>The next group to be vaccinated (Group 3) are those aged 70 and older in the following order: 85 and older, 80-84, 75-79, and 70-74. Vaccination of this group will begin this month.  </p><p>Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in direct patient contact roles will be vaccinated in Group 2. This includes HCWs working in public, private, and voluntary settings. Other HCWs, not in direct patient contact, will be vaccinated in Group 4.</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p></reply>

At the time we see fish in the Irish zone, there are also fish being caught in the international high seas and over a wide area from Spain to Norway.  There is no survey from which the abundance in Ireland's 200 miles zone may be determined.  </p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a national quota for Bluefin Tuna.  The available Bluefin Tuna quota is allocated each year to Member States on the basis of relative stability as established in the late 1990s.  At that time, Ireland did not have a track record of commercial fishing for Bluefin Tuna and, accordingly, did not receive a quota allocation.  </p>  <p>  A small Bluefin Tuna by-catch quota is available to Ireland, primarily for use in our important Northern Albacore Tuna fishery and Celtic Sea Herring fishery where there can be Bluefin Tuna by-catch.</p>  <p>  In 2018,  Ireland was successful, for the first time, in securing agreement that allowed countries without a commercial quota to set up a catch-tag-release fishery to contribute to the collection of scientific data.  A Catch-Tag-Release science-based fishery for authorised recreational angling vessels has been in place in Ireland since 2019 and supports the collection of valuable data on the migratory patterns of Bluefin Tuna in Irish waters. </p>  <p>  The only way to obtain a share of the EU quota now would involve changing relative stability within the EU.  The EU percentage share of the international TAC is set down and there is no likelihood that an international country will concede any share to the EU.  This means that EU Member States, with a national quota, would have to give up a share of their allocation to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The EU Commission has advised that it intends to commence the Common Fisheries Policy review process when there is clarity on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive.  At EU level, it is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States.   </p>  <p>  I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the review, including the interaction with stakeholders to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.   </p></reply>

This body is one of the six North South Implementation Bodies created under the Agreement.

However, this impact would have been far greater had the Barnier Task Force agreed to UK demands or had we been in a no-deal scenario which would have seen all EU vessels barred from UK waters and their subsequent displacement into Ireland's fishing zone. </p>  <p>  I have strongly expressed my disappointment to my EU counterparts, the Commission and Michel Barnier that the principle of burden sharing within the EU Member States has not been adequately respected.  I made clear that the inequitable relative contribution of quota share by Ireland is contributing to a strong sense of grievance within our fishing industry and indeed more broadly.   I pushed strongly that  a mechanism must be found within the EU Commission and relevant Member States to find solutions.</p>  <p>  I intend to continue to keep the focus on this situation and use any opportunity available to seek constructive solutions that would help to alleviate this unacceptable position. </p>  <p>  I have listened carefully to the representatives of the industry and, indeed, I have met individual fishers who are facing a difficult situation.  I have reflected on how to ensure that the funding made available to the sector in the Brexit Adjustment Reserve is focused to meet the challenges of the sector and of the coastal communities most impacted.   As I announced last week, I intend to set up a Task Force involving seafood industry representatives and representatives of other stakeholders to provide recommendations on the appropriate measures that will best support the sector and the local coastal communities.    </p>  <p>  I  will ask the Task Force to immediately focus on possible arrangements for a temporary fleet tie-up scheme to counter the impacts of the reduction in quotas which will impact from the beginning of April.  When the task force has recommended on a tie up scheme and it is implemented, it would provide short term assistance to fishing vessels most impacted by the quota agreements.</p>  <p>  The Task Force will, I hope, also provide recommendations on a range of other actions and measures that will allow the sector and the coastal communities to adjust and develop so as to  counter both direct and downstream impacts on the wider seafood sector and coastal communities.</p>  <p>  While the outcome on fisheries was a difficult compromise, I can assure you that the Government will work to ensure that the fisheries sector and the coastal communities that depend on it, are supported through the period ahead.</p></reply>

The Forum will be supported by a number of Working Groups including a Scientific Working Group which may be tasked with examining certain aspects of the TB Programme including transmission of disease from wildlife. The Scientific Working Group will be comprised of recognised experts with a track record of peer-reviewed publication.</p>  <p>  Supported by scientific research, the current policy is to vaccinate badgers to prevent disease outbreaks and to cull badgers where necessary in response to outbreaks in areas where epidemiological investigations have demonstrated the link between badgers and TB breakdowns on cattle farms.  Areas where badger culling may previously have taken place are being incorporated into the badger vaccination programme on an ongoing basis but only when any underlying disease spread to cattle from wildlife has been suppressed.  </p>  <p>  Since the commencement of badger vaccination in 2018, 19,079 Km2 of land has been switched to vaccination on a phased basis and this will continue.  The scientific evidence for the efficacy of badger culling is well established and the evidence to support badger vaccination within the TB eradication scheme is being added to on an ongoing basis as additional research is published in peer reviewed scientific journals.  My Department is currently collaborating with University College Dublin and the University of Waginengen to validate the efficacy of vaccination in the field and to model where higher risks exist at a local farm level which will support better targeting of TB controls in future years.  </p>  <p>  As the level of badger vaccination increases, it is expected that there will be fewer wildlife-driven TB outbreaks in cattle and thus less need for badger culling. It is likely, however, that some level of badger culling will remain necessary until TB levels have significantly reduced.  </p>  <p>  DAFM provides advice to farmers on how to reduce the risk of TB from wildlife which can be accessed at: www.bovinetb.ie</p>  <p>   The scientific veterinary publications underpinning this policy are listed below. </p>  <p>  - Efficacy of badger culling</p>  <p>  Badgers were first identified as being susceptible to infection with Mycobacterium bovis (M.bovis), the bacterium that causes bovine tuberculosis (bTB), during the 1970s.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) funded research which concluded that badgers were likely to have been involved in the recycling of bTB in cattle and concluded that eradication of bTB from the national herd would not be feasible until TB in badgers was addressed and controlled. </p>  <p>  Eves, J.A., 1993.

In this regard, my Department provides a range of supports and initiatives to encourage and assist beekeepers and the national beekeeping associations.

AFB and European Foul Brood (EFB) occur in Irish honey bee colonies and information on theses diseases and sampling process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.

The specific health requirements for trading in bees are laid out in Council Directive 92/65/EEC. All imports of bees must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the country of export. This is to ensure that imported bees are healthy and do not harbour pathogens or parasites that may be harmful to our native bee stocks. </p></reply>

These measures were introduced through a number of Commission Regulations.</p>  <p>  The first of these provided for temporary exceptional aid to farmers in the livestock sectors with Ireland being allocated &euro;13.7 million from a total package of &euro;420 million. Member States were allowed supplement this funding by a maximum of 100% and Ireland chose to avail of this option, thereby bringing the total budget to &euro;27.4 million. For administrative simplicity and in order to deliver payments to affected farmers as quickly as possible, it was decided to provide a flat-rate payment of &euro;1,395 to active dairy farmers, with a small number of additional payments made to new entrants and eligible young farmers. Approximately 17,600 dairy farmers benefitted from this scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition, during 2016 a voluntary milk production reduction scheme was introduced. Applicant dairy farmers were required to reduce production in the final quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and were paid an amount of 14c per kg reduction. Production volumes were verified by co-ops and the scheme was open to active dairy producers. Almost 4,000 dairy farmers benefitted from this scheme and were paid just over &euro;6.6 million in total. Participants were required to reduce production in advance of payment; therefore there was full compliance with the measure by beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme, developed by my Department in cooperation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, provided some &euro;145 million of low-cost, flexible working capital finance to over 4,000 farmers in 2017.  It was facilitated by &euro;25m in public funding, including &euro;11.1 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid to milk producers and farmers in other livestock sectors&rsquo; under Commission delegated Regulation 2016/1613. Normal bank lending terms and conditions applied to the loans, some of which continue to be repaid (loan terms ranged from one to six years).</p></reply>

The specific health requirements for trading in bees are laid out in Council Directive 92/65/EEC. All imports of bees must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the country of export. This is to ensure that imported bees are healthy and do not harbour pathogens or parasites that may be harmful to our native bee stocks. </p></reply>

The issue of isolation in rural and urban communities cuts across the work of a number of Departments, and this is reflected in ongoing work on community policing, rural transport and social inclusion, among other areas.</p>  <p>  Many of my Department's policies and funding programmes aim to address isolation issues in communities, and also deliver benefits by responding to the challenges facing vulnerable individuals due to COVID-19. </p>  <p>  The National Social Enterprise Policy aims to enable social enterprises increase their social, environmental and economic impact. Many social enterprises are based in rural or isolated areas and provide services to communities that may not otherwise be available. They also operate in our cities and other urban areas, often providing services to disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>Physical and social isolation can have a significant impact on people living in rural areas. My Department is finalising a new rural development policy for the next five years, which will build on the progress achieved through the Action Plan for Rural Development, which concluded in 2019. The policy will seek to strengthen and build resilience in our rural communities and will identify policy measures for delivery in order to achieve these objectives.</p>  <p>Other key interventions include funding the Seniors Alert Scheme, which enables older people to live securely, with peace of mind, in their homes through the provision of personal monitored alarms, ensuring contact is maintained with those who are vulnerable. In addition, as part of the Department&rsquo;s COVID-19 Action Plan  , increased support was provided for older people through our funding partnership with ALONE for their crisis telephone support line and follow-on practical supports for those who need it.</p>  <p>The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) is Ireland&rsquo;s primary social inclusion funding intervention, delivered locally by Local Development Companies (LDCs) to help those in the greatest need access supports to enable participation in communities. SICAP workers have extensive local connections and in-depth knowledge of available resources and supports and are continuing to work to ensure the emerging needs of their localities are responded to.</p>  <p>  Local Development Companies (LDCs) have put in place various measures to ensure SICAP supports continue to be delivered and that vulnerable people continue to be supported throughout the COVID-19 crises, examples as follows:</p>  <p>  Online supports are delivered via telephone, email, Zoom, etc., with LDCs providing additional support to individuals with limited access to technology, in the form providing them with laptops/tablets and upskilling them in their usage. </p>  <p>- LDCs that operate a &ldquo;friendly call&rdquo; service to elderly people saw an increase in demand for the service with some LDCs mobilizing  local community groups to become involved in making regular contact with older, vulnerable isolated people during COVID. </p>  <p>  - LDCs supported an increase in demand for Meals on Wheels services and foodbanks, particularly for those not able to travel to shops and those experiencing food poverty. </p>  <p>  - Other responses included Pharmacy &amp;amp; Shopping Services; Employment and Self-Employment Supports; Supports to Community Groups; Online Training; Health, Well-Being and Social Prescribing; Mental Health Supports. </p>  <p>  - My Department offered every flexibility to the Local Development Companies (LDCs) which freed up SICAP workers to focus on a community response to the crisis. Given their presence in local communities, the LDC response to the crisis was rapid and widespread with many of their 170,000 service users reached in the early days and weeks of the crisis.</p>  <p>Volunteering   is also very much at the forefront of initiatives of this nature and the Department will continue to support volunteering both by the provision of funding and other supports, and the implementation of the recently published National Volunteering Strategy. </p>  <p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) funding will ensure that remote areas, particularly those that are likely to wait longest for connections, are provided with access to high-speed broadband in their communities while waiting for the National Broadband Plan roll-out to reach them. </p>  <p>The 2020 Town and Village Renewal Scheme (T&amp;V) was tailored to help rural towns and villages respond to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The 2020 Scheme included two separate funding Measures &ndash; an Accelerated Measure and a Standard Measure - to enable towns and villages to tackle the short and medium-term impacts of COVID-19. Under the two measures, some &euro;25.8 million was approved for a total of 510 projects across the country.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to monitor the adequacy of these supports to address isolation during the coming months. </p></reply>

Such responsible dog ownership is the key to reducing incidences of sheep worrying and other problem behaviours.</p>  <p>  The Control of Dogs Acts 1986, as amended, set out a range of requirements for all dog owners or any other person in charge of a dog. In particular, section 9 of the 1986 Act outlines requirements regarding keeping dogs under effectual control. Section 9 (2) states that the owner or any other person in charge of a dog that worries livestock is guilty of an offence, while Section 21 of the 1986 Act provides that the owner of a dog shall be liable in damages for an attack on livestock.</p>  <p>  A public consultation process on a review of measures relating to the control of dogs in Ireland is nearing completion and I expect the findings of this review to be submitted to me shortly.  Some of the comments received through the consultation process would require a change to primary or secondary legislation.  My Department is considering these and other points as part of a review of the legislation in this area, and is now identifying any necessary legislative amendments, including in relation to the issues raised, that may be required with a view to inclusion in the 2021 Government legislative programme.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with all responsible stakeholders towards the shared aim of promoting responsible dog ownership and consistently reinforcing the message that dogs should never be allowed to roam alone.</p></reply>

Remote working can help to retain talented people in rural communities, encourage mobile workers to move to the regions, provide increased trade for local businesses, and revitalise our rural towns.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been working with the Western Development Commission (WDC) over the last year to develop an integrated network of remote working hubs along the Atlantic Economic Corridor (AEC), from Kerry to Donegal.  The WDC has identified and mapped more than 100 remote working hubs which serve that region. </p>  <p>  This project is now being extended to a national scale. A Working Group, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, was established last October to oversee the development of a National Remote Working Hub Network.  The first phase of this Group&rsquo;s work is to identify, map, survey and classify the various remote working facilities available throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  This work will lead to the establishment of an integrated network of remote working facilities with shared back-office services for the hubs, and a common booking engine for users.  This will become a significant knowledge asset to inform future investment in remote working facilities. </p>  <p>  In addition, since 2016 my Department has been working on the Broadband Connection Points (BCP) initiative, which is now rolling out across the country. BCPs are amongst the first deliverables under the National Broadband Plan in the State intervention area and will provide free public access to high-speed wifi broadband at approximately 300 locations in some of the most remote parts of the country. The location of all BCPs which have been installed or which are planned at any point in time is available at: https://nbi.ie/bcp-map/.  Many BCPs have the potential to provide remote working facilities. </p>  <p>  I secured an additional &euro;5 million this year under my Department's Town and Village Renewal Scheme for investment in remote working facilities at hubs and BCPs throughout the country and I hope to be in a position to announce details of this funding stream shortly.</p></reply>

Welfare standards regarding dog breeding establishments have been provided for through guidelines.</p>  <p>  In July 2018, following a public consultation, my Department published revised guidelines for Dog Breeding Establishments.  These came into effect on 1 January 2019.  There is a substantial shift in the new guidelines towards a focus on the welfare of dogs and pups.  Each local authority is responsible for the monitoring of these standards with regard to the registration of such establishments.</p>  <p>  Following a review, my Department is currently developing necessary legislative amendments to the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, with a view to inclusion in the 2021 Government legislative programme. </p></reply>

In September 2020, my Department invested &euro;3m in a Small Scale Capital Works programme which supported local authorities in carrying out refurbishment works in library branches thereby helping them to adapt to comply with Government health guidance. Kildare County Council were approved funding of &euro;100,000 under this initiative and this supported works in all 14 library branches in the county. </p>  <p>  In addition, during 2020, my Department invested some &euro;400,000 in the excellent online library service which has soared in levels of membership and usage since the beginning of the pandemic. The service provides access to more than 48,000 eBooks and 33,000 eAudiobooks, 4,000 magazines, 2,400 online newspapers from over 100 countries, more than 500 e-learning courses and 100 online language courses.  These online services will continue to be provided in 2021.  </p></reply>
