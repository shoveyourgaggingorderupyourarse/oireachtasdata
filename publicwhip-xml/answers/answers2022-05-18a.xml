From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  The Department issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity. </p>  <p>  The Department recognises the impact delays in the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers.  An internal plan of action has been implemented which has increased resources and introduced more efficient methods of processing applications in the permits system.  The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has more than tripled compared to 2021 levels.</p>  <p>  Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits Unit has made positive progress to reduce the current backlog reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from c. 11,000 in January 2022 to under 6,000 to date, despite further strong growth in demand in 2022.  As new staff were trained on Critical Skills and Intra Corporate Transfer Employment Permits, processing times for those permits have fallen from 21 weeks to 6 weeks.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all employment permit applications for medical personnel are expedited.</p>  <p>  The Employment Permits Unit is coming to the end of processing the bulk of the 3,000 additional General Employment Permits applications made available to the meat and horticultural sectors (c.1,000 horticulture applications and c.2,000 meat applications), following the latest review of the Occupational Lists last year, in addition to normal processing workload. </p>  <p>  Processing times for General Employment Permit applications for Trusted Partners have fallen from 22 weeks to 16 weeks.  Processing times for General Employment Permit applications from Standard applicants should begin to fall next week.</p>  <p>  The Department expects to see a consistent strong fall in waiting times for General Employment Permits from mid-May, with processing times considerably reduced by end of Q2.  We will continue to drive them lower in Q3.</p>  <p>  In respect of the fees paid for General Employment Permits, under employment permit legislation 90% of the fee paid is refunded to the applicant if the application is either refused or withdrawn.</p></reply>

The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where it is evidenced that there is more than sufficient availability of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo regular, evidence-based review guided by relevant research, a public/stakeholder consultation, the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group and relevant policy Departments, in this case the Department of Health. Account is taken of education and training outputs and known contextual factors such as Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic and the ending of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and their impact on the labour market. </p>  <p>  Changes announced in June 2021 included removing a number of Health Care occupations from the Ineligible Occupations List. The subsequent review did not recommend removal of the occupation of care worker/home carers from the Ineligible Occupations List at that time as available evidence suggested that contracts of employment on offer and employment terms and conditions being offered were factors in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector. </p>  <p>  Department officials are actively engaged with the Department of Health in relation to recruitment challenges and my Department is a member of the recently established Cross Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group chaired by the Department of Health to consider the recruitment and retention challenges faced by the home care sector. The Department continues to review the employment permits system in light of changing labour market circumstances.</p>  <p>  The next review of the occupations lists is expected to commence with a public consultation in Q2 2022. When open, submissions will be invited from sector representative bodies and interested parties via the Public Consultation Form which will be accessible on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The latest results, released in December last year, show a very strong first year of this Strategy.</p><p>Highlights of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s performance throughout 2021 include the creation of over 29,000 new jobs in IDA supported client companies, bringing the numbers directly employed in the multinational sector in Ireland to 275,384. The net number of jobs created in 2021 was 16,826 with the existing base of FDI showing continued resilience. In total 249 investments were won with 104 of these new name investments</p><p>More than half (53%) of investments won during 2021 went to regional locations with every region experiencing growth. The Border Region covers counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo. There are 67 IDA client companies in the Border Region supporting 8,721 jobs directly and 6.977 jobs indirectly.  IDA Ireland client employment in the region grew by 3% in 2021 with an additional 226 net jobs created. </p><p>The FDI performance in the region has been strong over the past five years with employment among IDA clients increasing by 22% within the Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies, Medical Technologies, Technology, International Financial Services and Life Sciences sectors.</p><p>From an economic impact perspective, &euro;450 million was spent by IDA client companies in the region on payroll during 2020; &euro;564 million was spent on Services and Materials; and &euro;51 million was spent on in-house R&amp;amp;D (2020 ABSEI).</p><p>Under their Regional Property Programme, over their last strategy IDA delivered an Advanced Technology Building in Sligo. IDA has also partnered with Sligo County Council to develop the Western Distributor Road, opening up the 85-acre land bank at Oakfield, Sligo. </p><p>The IDA has recently completed an Advanced Office Building in Finisklin, Sligo and an Advanced Technology Unit in Monaghan.  Additional Advanced Building Solutions will be delivered in Cavan, Sligo and Letterkenny during the lifetime of the current Strategy (2021-2024).</p><p>Planning permission for an Advanced Technology Building in Carrick on Shannon has been granted through a partnership with Leitrim County Council. IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with the private sector in the North-West provision of appropriate and cost-effective building and property solutions for client companies.</p><p>The 2021 figures show a pattern of sustained, robust growth in FDI investment and employment over a continuous period of more than ten years.  I expect the IDA&rsquo;s 2022 mid-year results to be announced in June.</p></reply>

This programme is a fund of funds, which is an indirect form of equity financing for SMEs. SMEs will not directly apply for funding through this programme.</p>  <p>  The programme, which is being managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF), will provide vital venture capital to innovative Irish companies at seed stage and is an important step in developing and expanding the pool of private capital available to early-stage companies wanting to grow in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Totalling &euro;90 million, the programme is made up of a &euro;30 million contribution from the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment through its agency Enterprise Ireland (EI), whilst the EIF will match this investment by providing a further &euro;30 million. The Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) will co-invest a further &euro;30 million. This &euro;90 million, backed by these strong partners, will be an important cornerstone investment and will attract private co-investment.  </p>  <p>  Essentially, this programme is a pool of funding drawn from multiple sources, that provides capital for specialist fund managers, who will in turn then seek to invest that capital in SMEs from areas that are often less well served across a variety of sectors and regions in Ireland.</p>  <p>The first call for expressions of interest from experienced fund managers was issued in February and closed on April 29th. It is expected that three to four successful funds will receive investment, and they will, in turn, invest in multiple SMEs from different sectors and regions across the State. </p>  <p>  The programme partners, EIF, EI, and ISIF, have been processing and screening the applications, in line with the programme&rsquo;s strategic goals. Once these are fully processed, the plan is to sign at least one fund before the end of 2022 with the remaining agreements to be signed in the first half of 2023. It's not a question of SMEs applying directly to the Irish Innovation Seed Fund Programme. Once an agreement has been signed with a fund, the fund will then seek SMEs in which to invest.</p></reply>

In 2021, I formally requested that the Low Pay Commission examine this commitment.</p>  <p>  To inform its considerations, the Low Pay Commission asked the ESRI to conduct background technical research on a universal basic income under the terms of the Low Pay Commission-ESRI Research Partnership Agreement.</p>  <p>  The study was to examine the universal basic income pilots that have taken place in other jurisdictions in order to identify what has been learned and what might be relevant to a pilot in Ireland. It was also to identify which policy objectives a universal basic income pilot could address and the associated risks and financial implications. It was to conclude with recommendations on how a pilot in Ireland might be designed and how it could be run.</p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission intends to provide a report to me on this research and its recommendations by the end of June 2022. I will work with my officials to examine the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s findings and recommendations.

Ireland does not ratify international conventions until it has been determined that national law is in line with the provisions of the international instrument.</p><p>The ILO Convention 190 is the first ever international instrument on the very important issues of eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work. Ireland already has very strong protections in law to combat violence and harassment in the world of work and has ratified the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.</p><p>Officials in my Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment have engaged with all relevant Government Departments and offices to establish the extent to which domestic legislative provisions already provide for the rights and entitlements included in the ILO Convention C190, as well as legislative amendments, if any, that may be required to enable ratification.</p><p>Based on legal advice recently received, a comprehensive gap analysis is being progressed to assess if there are any gaps in the State&rsquo;s legislation with the articles of the Convention and to ensure that the obligations placed on the State by those articles are fully met, this was deemed necessary due to the range and complexity of legislation covered by the Convention. </p><p>Following this consideration, as part of the ratification process, in the coming months the Department will undertake a stakeholder consultation with trade unions, employer representative bodies and other interested parties. </p><p>The views of the Attorney General must then be sought after that consultation phase followed by the formal approval of the Government for ratification.</p><p>I would anticipate that the Instrument of Ratification can be signed before the end of the year.</p></reply>

ComReg advises that the current minimum coverage obligations in those licences are being considerably exceeded by all operators. Capital investment by telecommunications operators over the last 5 years was in the order of &euro;3.3 billion for both fixed and mobile services. This has significantly enhanced the availability of services, both voice and data, throughout Ireland, including in rural areas.  </p><p>ComReg is currently in the process of running another Multi-band Spectrum Award to assign rights of use in four spectrum bands. The award comprises 470 MHz of spectrum and represents a 46% increase in the harmonised spectrum assigned for the provision of wireless broadband services in Ireland. This will significantly enable the market to provide improved services to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data and new services. The proposals include significant coverage obligations for prospective winning bidders.  </p><p>To assist consumers to choose the network provider that best meets their needs, ComReg has developed a national outdoor coverage map (available at this link). This map provides consumers with very clear information on where operators have good 2G, 3G and 4G coverage. </p><p>The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce ('the Taskforce') has been in operation since 2016 and has been a driving force for improving access to telecommunications services nationwide. It has completed over 70 targeted actions to alleviate connectivity barriers and continues to tackle issues impeding the rollout of mobile and fixed connectivity. The Taskforce is co-managed by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD). </p><p>Relevant links associated with the work of the Taskforce can be found at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/db7f83-mobile-phone-and-broadband-taskforce/</i>. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government and Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets to retrofit the equivalent of 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2/cost optimal or carbon equivalent and the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes to replace older, less efficient heating systems by end-2030.  The National Retrofit Plan sets out how the Government will achieve these targets. The retrofit of these homes will improve the energy efficiency of the residential sector and reduce energy waste in these homes.</p>  <p>  The Government has also put a range of policies and measures in place to support households who are at risk of energy poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance, the Household Benefits Package and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. </p>  <p>  Recognising the unprecedented rise in energy prices facing people the Government has also put in place a number of additional measures earlier this year including:</p>  <p>  - an increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter, an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance in mid-March.</p>  <p>  - the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;176.22 (excl. VAT) credited to their accounts.</p>  <p>  - the new National Retrofit Schemes include specific measures to support householders in taking actions to reduce energy bills, including up to 80% grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation.</p>  <p>  To further manage the impact of recent price increases the Government, in the recently published National Energy Security Framework, has also announced a number of additional measures for households and businesses including:</p>  <p>  - A new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons.</p>  <p>  - A package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt in the electricity and gas sectors.</p>  <p>  - A review of the price-drivers behind electricity and natural gas bills (including network costs) with a view to mitigating cost increases for consumers and businesses in the near term.</p>  <p>  - The continuation of the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil until the Budget in October 2022.</p>  <p>  - A reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.</p>  <p>  - An additional payment of &euro;100 for all recipients of the Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  - The reduction to zero of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy on electricity bills.</p>  <p>  In addition to the measures outlined above, the electricity and gas markets, which are overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, have a range of protections against disconnections in place for consumers. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly, any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance available.</p>  <p>  A research network on fuel poverty chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute was established in 2021. The Group consists of representatives from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Social Protection, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office. The Group is examining the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures for fuel poverty in Ireland. The main goal is to provide insights that enhance policy design to protect vulnerable households. A work programme, proposed outputs and timelines will be agreed and finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed in the coming weeks to inform future policy in this area.</p></reply>

However, due to the disruption to the hospitality, tourism, leisure and, thus, taxi industries with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting travel restrictions in 2020 and 2021, and in recognition of the likely passenger reaction to an increase at that time, the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles and taxi industry group representatives, advised that the commencement of the Maximum Fares Order be postponed.  My Department and the NTA accepted this recommendation. Therefore, the current fare review is taking the 2019 fare review into account.  </p>  <p>  The revised Maximum Fare proposals recently published by the NTA as part of its public consultation on this issue include a proposed average fare increase of 12.5%.  The consultation process will run until May 27th and details are available on the NTA website.</p>  <p>  The NTA has confirmed that it will endeavour to conclude the review process quickly, following the conclusion of the public consultation.  </p></reply>

As such, I have referred your question to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within 10 working days.</p><p>The Government and the NTA have recently taken a number of steps to support taxi drivers who are already in the industry.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has introduced a series of cost-of-living measures in recent weeks and months, including the reduction of excise duty by 20 cents a litre on petrol, and 15 cents a litre on diesel.  For its part, the NTA is currently reviewing the existing Maximum Fares Order and has proposed an average increase of 12.5% on taxi fares from 31st August 2022. The NTA&rsquo;s proposals are currently open for public consultation until May 27th. </p><p>By facilitating this increase in maximum fares, the NTA is addressing the pressures that the taxi industry clearly faces, particularly the rising cost of fuel.  It is hoped that increasing taxi fares, particularly the premium fare which is charged for journeys taken between 8pm and 8am or on Sundays / public holidays, will encourage more taxi drivers to operate during that time, as well as making the sector more attractive to new entrants, thus increasing availability to passengers nationally. </p></reply>

The incentive offers a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>  <p>  For a property to qualify for HTB, it must be new or converted for use as a dwelling, having not previously been used as a dwelling. In the circumstances where the house was previously used as a dwelling but knocked down and rebuilt, then it is considered &ldquo;new&rdquo;. First-time buyers may purchase a site containing a house which is derelict and which they plan to demolish, in whole or in part, with the intention of building a new house. First time buyers intending to undertake such purchases should contact Revenue via MyEnquiries outlining the specific circumstances of their case and Revenue will consider them on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific question about extending the scheme to second-hand properties, HTB is designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. An increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current housing crisis and so remains a priority aim of Government policy. A move to include second-hand properties within the scope of the relief would not improve its effectiveness; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional new supply.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, I announced in my Budget 2022 address that a formal review of HTB would take place in 2022. Following a successful procurement competition, a contract for the review is currently being finalised. </p>  <p>  The review will help inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022.  However, without wishing to prejudice the outcome of the exercise, it is unlikely that it will lead to an extension of the HTB scheme along the lines mentioned by the Deputy. </p></reply>

From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO<sub>2</sub>emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO<sub>2</sub>-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. </p><p>I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  However, in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold.</p><p>This BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. </p></reply>

These two- and three-bed dwellings are expected to be delivered at an average discount of 25% on market values, ranging in price from &euro;166,000 to &euro;258,000.  </p><p>In addition, South Dublin County Council recently advertised 16 Affordable Purchase homes in Kilcarbery Grange, Clondalkin all to be delivered this year, which will priced from between &euro;245,600 and &euro;285,300. </p><p>Waterford City and County Council also expect to deliver Affordable Purchase homes at a development in Mount Neil, Carrickphierish by the end of 2022. In addition, a further development at Summerfields, Kilbarry is expected to deliver its first phase in 2022. A pipeline of affordable housing delivery is being developed by local authorities with nine schemes expected to go on site in 2022.  </p><p>In addition to the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 provides for the establishment of the First Home Scheme to support purchases in the private market. The First Home Scheme will help applicants to afford new homes in the private market through the use of an equity share model, similar to that employed in Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme. The scheme aims to support the purchase of c. 8,000 new homes in the private market in the years 2022 to 2026. First Home will only support purchases of homes within regional price ceilings, set with reference to the median prices for new homes purchased by first-time buyers in the area. It is anticipated that the scheme will be rolled out over the coming months. </p><p>As affordable housing programmes are rolled out, additional affordable housing delivery will be facilitated through the expanded 20% Part V planning requirement, and through the Land Development Agency.</p></reply>

The strategy sets out, over four pathways, a broad suite of measures to achieve its policy objectives together with a financial commitment of in excess of &euro;4 billion per annum.</p>  <p>  Housing for All commits to a range of measures to address vacancy and maximise the use of existing housing stock including plans to introduce a new programme for the Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) of vacant properties to ensure their use for residential purposes. The objective is for all Local Authorities, including Galway City Council and Galway County Council, to acquire at least 2,500 vacant units by 2026. The detailed arrangements for the CPO programme are currently being developed, with the aim of advancing it this year, and it will build on the experience of many Local Authorities that already utilise CPO acquisitions in their delivery of new social homes through the Buy and Renew scheme.</p></reply>

The Commissioner is independent in the performance of his functions under the Valuation Acts.  The Valuation Acts provide that certain categories of properties are not rateable.

Such exempt buildings would principally include domestic premises, agricultural land, buildings used for public worship, education, health care provided and charitable purposes, on a not-for-profit basis.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 includes a provision to enable local authorities to introduce rates alleviation measures to support local and national policy objectives.

The Passport Services advises them of the action required and provides a pre-paid return-addressed envelope that will be delivered to the Passport Service on the day after the applicant posts it.</p><p>For applicants who apply online and whose applications are incomplete, the Passport Service emails the applicant to advise of them of the action that is required and includes a pre-paid address label with a barcode that can be affixed to the envelope and will be delivered to the Passport Service on the day after the applicant posts it. </p><p>The methods outlined above ensure that all post received by the Passport Service can be tracked internally once it is delivered, which is vitally important for the smooth running of the system and to protect applicants' personal data.

The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021.</p>  <p>  There are currently 37,000 Foreign Birth Registration applications on hand with the Passport Service. To date this year, the Passport Service has processed almost 5,000 Foreign Birth Registration applications. </p>  <p>  Due to the complex nature of the FBR process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time. </p>  <p>  FBR staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly. For other applications, the FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year.</p></reply>

The report was published on the 9th February 2022.  </p>  <p>  The Commission undertook a significant body of work encompassing their wide-ranging terms of reference.  The report contains 69 main recommendations and a number of sub recommendations.  The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  </p>  <p>  The Commission's report proposes significant changes for the Defence Forces, including to Defence Forces culture, high-level command and control structures, and for the level of Defence provision in Ireland.  Clearly, there are matters that require careful consideration and in some critical aspects inter-departmental discussion. This includes the level of resourcing that may be allocated to Defence, legislative implications and the governance framework that will be required to underpin any changes the Government approve on foot of the Commission's report. </p>  <p>  I am also seeking the views of my Department and the Defence Forces.  I will also engage with key stakeholders and the Oireachtas, and I welcome the D&aacute;il statements on the report which took place on the 16th February.  I firmly believe that this is an opportunity to have a mature debate around the type of defence capabilities that we require and I am very much open to such a discussion.  Current events are highlighting the importance of such a debate.</p>  <p>  The intent is that following relevant consideration, and before the summer recess, I will revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan.   </p>  <p>  One of the Report's recomendations is that the structure of the Army be reviewed and, in that context, the disposition of Units across the Defence Forces may be considered. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculative discussion on this matter prior to completion of the ongoing process, Government approval of any proposed plan of action, and completion of any subsequent reviews that may ensue.</p></reply>

Where necessary, schools may also purchase new or additional equipment or software for students from normal school resources or funds. An investment programme of &euro;210m has been delivered to schools under the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015 &ndash;2020.  Additionally, the first tranche of the successor Digital Strategy for schools to 2027, ICT grant funding of &euro;50m has recently issued to schools. Decisions regarding the use and deployment of digital technology in schools is a matter for the Board of Management of each school, as schools are best placed to determine the most appropriate solution to adopt in terms of supporting the learning needs of their students based on school's own context and circumstances, and in accordance with their Digital Learning Plan. The grant funding allocation issues directly to schools and can be used to provide devices for use by students and teachers, for learning platforms, software and overall digital technology infrastructure development in the school.  In addition, my Department as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) under Next Generation EU funding facility, to provide for a scheme for learners at risk of educational disadvantage through the digital divide, issued a once-off grant in December 2021 to recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme. This funding also issued directly to schools as they are best placed to determine the needs of their own cohort. </p>  <p>  Where children with more complex disabilities require essential specialist equipment to access the school curriculum, which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the schools existing provisions, schools may make an application for such equipment to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) under the terms of this scheme.</p>  <p>  The NCSE through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports. SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology/specialised equipment is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support.</p>  <p>  Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the Assistive Technology Scheme, a student must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the student to access the curriculum.</p>  <p>  SENOs will review the application, and professional reports provided in support of same, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met. They will then make a recommendation to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department will decide on the level of grant, if any, to be provided. </p>  <p>  The type of equipment provided under the Assistive Technology Scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.</p>  <p>  Communication devices or medical or therapy related devices which are not specific educational interventions or equipment specifically required as essential for school educational access, and which have a general application outside of school, are not provided for under the Assistive Technology scheme, however. Such equipment is normally provided for children with disabilities by the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department have not received an application for assistive technology under Circular 10/2013 for this student.</p></reply>

Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.</p><p>To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.</p><p>Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools.</p><p>These include </p><p>- A Centralised Application Process to reduce admin burden on schools. </p><p>- Provision of funding  to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes. </p><p>- Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers. </p><p>- Guidance, Information  and support will be provided to schools to help design and deliver  the programmes. </p><p>- Earlier payment of school staff will be facilitated</p><p>- Capitation Grant Funding will be provided to cover the running costs of the scheme  including enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.</p><p>Through the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education (NABMSE) the Department and Inspectorate recently hosted a webinar for special schools and provided a presentation on supports and benefits of running a school based summer programme including the positive outcomes for students that participated in the 2021 programme.</p><p>Participation in the scheme is voluntary and is therefore a matter for the Board of Management of a school whether or not it will participate in the programme in any given year. Furthermore, the Department cannot compel schools to participate in the programme.  </p><p>My Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.</p></reply>

The school planning areas were developed for use with the Department&rsquo;s Geographic Information System (GIS) in 2008 and with the introduction of Small Areas in Census 2011, these areas were amended to align with Census Small Areas. The current school planning areas take account not only of local groupings of schools, but also of natural boundaries, Census Small Areas and other local conditions.</p>  <p>  The school planning areas provide a useful means of projecting demographic demand in a localised area or areas, thereby allowing the Department to determine oncoming growth at a relatively localised level to inform recommendations and decisions on where additional school places may be needed. However, there can be a high degree of inward and outward mobility of children between school planning areas, particularly in urban areas, and parents are free to apply to enrol their children in any school, whether that is in the school planning area in which they reside or not.</p></reply>

In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with school patron bodies/school authorities to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. </p><p>Following an extensive site identification, assessment and negotiation process, agreement in principle, subject to contract, has been reached for the acquisition, by the Department of Education, of a permanent school site in Kildare Town to provide a replacement school for the Curragh Post Primary School. This site will accommodate 1,000 pupils and will include a 4 classroom special education needs unit. The new school will cater for the increased demographic growth at post-primary level due to occur in the Kildare South region over the coming years, the majority of which is projected to occur in Kildare Town. The location of this 8 acre greenfield site is next to two existing primary schools, Kildare Town Educate Together National School and Gaelscoil Mhic Aodha, within the grounds of the former Magee Barracks, Kildare Town. The development of the post primary school on this site will enhance the education facilities available to the Curragh Post Primary School and the existing primary schools in a new educational campus arrangement. </p><p>Due to commercial sensitivities, it is not possible to provide further information at this time. </p><p>A number of other building projects in post primary schools in South Kildare are currently underway or being planned, which includes projects at:</p><p>- Cross and Passion College, Kilcullen</p><p>- Patrician Secondary School, Newbridge</p><p>- Ardscoil Rathangan</p><p>- St. Conleth&rsquo;s Community College, Newbridge</p><p>- St. Paul&rsquo;s Secondary School, Monasterevin</p><p>- Holy Family Secondary School, Newbridge (application received and currently being examined with information awaited from the school)</p><p>My Department is aware that there are currently places available in St. Conleth's Post-Primary School in Newbridge for the 2022/23 school year.

In line with last year, the total funding available to provide summer programmes this year is up to &euro;40 million. Building on the 2021 programme, all schools, both primary and post-primary, are encouraged to provide this valuable programme to their students. In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.</p>  <p>  A key objective of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to increase the number of schools offering the summer programme to their students. Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to encourage them to participate. These Include: the provision of paid overseeing and preparation time for schools, a reduction in the administrative burden for schools, arrangements to pay staff sooner, greater guidance, an online payments portal for schools, and greater flexibility in the timing of the programme. </p>  <p>  However, my Department also recognises that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable. It is important that the home-based programme provides support for the education and/or care needs of students with complex needs during the summer break period.</p>  <p>  Under the home-based programme grant funding is made available so that parents/legal guardians can engage the services of a teacher or an SNA to provide tuition or care support as appropriate in the child&rsquo;s home.  Schools are requested to provide parents with the contact details of a teacher/SNA where possible. </p>  <p>  The NCSE have compiled a non-exhaustive list of private home tutor services and online platforms who may advertise for tutors for the 2022 Summer Programme and published it on their website.</p>  <p>  The Irish Primary Principals Network has created a Summer Programme Noticeboard for teachers and SNAs to advertise their availability for the programme.  Additionally this year, parents can also post notices on the noticeboard to source suitable candidates. </p>  <p>  The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.</p></reply>

The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools places a strong focus on issues such as safe use of the internet, social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem.</p><p>There is a wide range of training material available through the Webwise Internet Safety Programme to support teachers, students and parents on online safety. <i></i>Funded by the Department of Education and the EU Internet Safety Initiative, webwise.ie promotes the autonomous, effective and safe use of the internet by young people through a sustained information and awareness strategy targeting school leaders, teachers, parents and children themselves with consistent and relevant messages. The webwise.ie resource includes a dedicated School/Teachers Hub with extensive SPHE curricular supports, a Parents Hub and Youth Hub which gives practical information and advice on the safe, ethical and responsible use of the internet and addresses key issues such as cyberbullying, sexting, image sharing, respectful communication, social media, popular apps and more. A new online course for primary and post-primary teachers, <i>Understanding, Preventing and Responding to Cyberbullying in school</i>, is planned for 2022. The course will be provided by Webwise and the PDST Technology In Education on their online platform: <i>www.pdsttechnologyineducation.ie/</i>. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Digital Strategy for Schools also promotes the development of digital literacy in our young people and the importance of respectful online communications. A new Strategy, the Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027, was published in April. The Strategy will advance the embedding of digital technologies across teaching, learning and assessment, building on the work done under previous strategies. It aims to further support the school system so that all students across our schools have the opportunity to gain the knowledge and skills they need to navigate an ever-evolving digital world successfully.</p><p>The Strategy was developed following an extensive consultation process with all relevant stakeholders.  This included students at primary and post-primary level, parents/guardians, teachers and school leaders as well as the education partners, initial teacher education institutions, disability groups, non-governmental organisations, the industry sector, EU colleagues in a number of member states and other relevant Government Departments.</p><p>Delivery of the Strategy will involve ongoing collaboration and engagement with all key stakeholders. It allows for the establishment of both a consultative and an industry group which will further help support the implementation of the objectives of the Strategy and ensure its currency over its lifetime to 2027.</p><p>Online safety and the safe and ethical use of digital technologies is a key component of the new Strategy. The Strategy will continue to work towards ensuring learners have the opportunities to develop their digital skills so that they can navigate the digital world in a confident and competent manner and that their voices are heard and taken into account in further developments in this area. This will be further examined in the Implementation Plan. Ultimately a fundamental focus of the Strategy is learners and their wellbeing and ensuring that all of the policies, supports and resources are aimed at providing opportunities for learners to develop their digital skills so that they can navigate the digital world in a confident and competent manner.</p><p>Throughout the implementation of the Strategy, Webwise will continue to develop and disseminate relevant resources and run campaigns addressing key topical issues as they arise. This will take into account relevant recommendations and advice such as those arising from the review of the Action Plan on Bullying and from the National Advisory Council for Online Safety. </p><p>A &lsquo;Research Observatory on Cyberbullying&rsquo; has been established at DCU which is focused on providing up-to-date research, advice and resources related to cyberbullying, cyberhate, and online harassment, and the implementation of Coco&rsquo;s Law.  The Observatory team has put together an outline of an online research repository of resources on cyberbullying, cyberhate and online harassment which will be made available in early 2022 for researchers and the general public.  </p><p>The funding details requested by the Deputy are not immediately available and once collated they will be provided to her separately by written reply. </p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the School Transport Schemes children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  An eligible child for whom no transport service is available may, following an application for transport within prescribed time limits, receive a Remote Area Grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements. This grant is also payable for eligible children who may have to travel 3.2 kms or more to or from a designated pick up/set down point.</p>  <p>  Grants are based on the distance from home to school and range from &euro;1.30 per day to the maximum daily allowance payable of &euro;5.10 per day per family.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, the Government recently announced a reduction in excise on fuel resulted in a decrease in the cost of fuel.

The package is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The package is also available to some people under the age of 66, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments.  Only one Household Benefits package is payable per household. </p>  <p>  The Fuel Allowance scheme is a means tested payment to assist pensioners and other long-term social welfare dependent householders with their winter heating costs.  This payment was increased from &euro;28.00 to &euro;33.00 per week in Budget 2022 and is a contribution towards heating costs, it is not intended to meet these costs in full.  The payment is made over the winter season, either weekly or, if preferred, by way of two lump sum payments.  Only one Fuel Allowance is payable per household.  Those who qualify for the payment do not need to reapply annually. </p>  <p>  At the end of 2021, the Household Benefits package was paid to some 484,000 recipients and the Fuel allowance to some 375,000 recipients.  Numbers in receipt of both the Household Benefits package and the Fuel Allowance scheme was some 210,000.</p>  <p>  There is no fuel element associated with the Household Benefits package.  There is, however, the electricity and gas allowances, as mentioned above. </p>  <p>  In 2013, the arrangements governing the electricity / gas allowance were changed from a unit-based allowance to a credit-based allowance.  The rate was set at &euro;1.15 a day (&euro;35 per month approximately).  Any decision to enhance or increase the electricity and gas aspect of the package would have to be considered in the context of overall budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices.  To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has announced significant additional expenditure which will make a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.</p>  <p>  As part of these measures, I announced an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 for those in receipt of Fuel Allowance in mid-March 2022.  Furthermore, as part of the measures included in the National Energy Security Framework, I announced a further additional lump sum payment of &euro;100, equivalent to over 3 weeks additional fuel allowance, to be paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance during the final week of the 2021/22 season.  This payment issued week beginning the 16th May 2022.</p>  <p>  This means that low-income households will see an increase of 55% in Fuel Allowance support provided during this Fuel Allowance season compared to last season. </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Through this Annual Programme, priority has been attached to, inter alia, the creation of places for children under 3.</p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p><p>Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21%. Corresponding data for Dublin is shown below:</p><p>June 2021 Dublin vacancy rates <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Vacant places</th>       <th>Children enrolled</th>       <th>% vacant places</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown</td>       <td>403</td>       <td>3,784</td>       <td>11%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - South Dublin</td>       <td>983</td>       <td>5,577</td>       <td>18%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - Dublin City</td>       <td>1,662</td>       <td>8,263</td>       <td>20%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin - Fingal</td>       <td>1,176</td>       <td>5,793</td>       <td>20%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As part of ongoing efforts by my Department to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, Pobal, using the data captured as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey in June 2021 and current registration data, recently projected national vacancy rates in February 2022. These projections revealed an estimated fall in national vacancy rates from June 2021 to February 2022 &ndash; with vacancy rates projected to have fallen from 21% to 19%. </p><p>Pobal has commenced new data collection as of 4 April 2022, as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey. This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established.</p><p>In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, CCC are currently proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to identify unused capacity and explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of unmet early learning and childcare needs of families.</p><p>Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance.

Update data is currently being captured as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile.</p>  <p>  The cuurent profile of vacant places in Dublin City follows the profile nationally whereby the majority of capacity (enrolled and vacant places) in services is for pre-schoolers followed by school-age children and toddlers and babies.  Overall, the proportion of places for babies and toddlers is higher in more urbanised counties, while demand for these places is very high.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the availability of high-quality early learning and childcare that isaffordable and accessible is a key Government priority. </p>  <p>  Since 2015, significant increases in State investment in early learning and childcare has given rise to a substantial growth in the numbers of children participating in these services.

The FECP shared extremely detailed materials at this meeting, including case studies and extensive data on provider costs. This was followed a number of days later with the letter attached to the email received by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  There is a great level of detail contained within the various materials provided. My officials have over the past week been examining these materials in order to issue a comprehensive response to the FECP. A reply has been prepared by officials in my Department to issue to the FECP shortly.</p>  <p>  The response to the FECP will seek further clarification on the data provided and address a number of the issues raised but I think it is important to be clear that the Department will not be accepting the proposals made by this sector representative group to extend the scope for additional optional extras or voluntary contributions to be charged to parents whose children are participating in the ECCE programme.  It is my view that this risks parents incurring additional charges for a universal service which is designed and intended to be free at the point of use and available to all families, regardless of ability to pay.  That would be entirely contrary to the spirit of the programme. </p>  <p>  In examining all of the data available to the Department, including that provided by the FECP, there is no evidence about a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding.  The vast majority of services will see an increase in funding, and around 1% of service will see no change. No service will see a decrease in funding. </p>  <p>  The sectoral information on income and costs does not show signs of financial unviability for ECCE-only services. In fact, the evidence suggests that ECCE-only services see the highest levels of income in excess of costs compared to other types of provision. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring more stability of income for services, and that is one of the key objectives of Core Funding. </p>  <p>  The vast majority of services will see an increase in funding, and around 1% of service will see no change. No service will see a decrease in funding. For any service that does experience financial difficulties, a Sustainability Fund will be in place.  This new strand of the Sustainability Fund, linked to Core Funding, will be designed to provide an extra safety net for providers.  This will be open to both private and community providers. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed increasing investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare. As part of this, the new Core Funding package amounts to &euro;221 million in full year costs (&euro;173 million of which is new investment).  </p>  <p>  Every year a number of services close and others open.  Current data on service closures and openings are not markedly different to the trend in previous years. This data also shows that services close for a wide range of reasons including retirement of owners or other personal circumstances and only a small minority relate to sustainability issues.  </p>  <p>  The &euro;221 million Core Funding budget is distributed to services in a fair and proportionate manner, based primarily on the features that determine services&rsquo; operating costs.  </p>  <p>  Importantly, Core Funding and this significant increase in investment is the vehicle through which the Government will deliver improved pay and conditions for staff through supporting the drawing up of Employment Regulation Order for different roles of the sector by the Joint Labour Committee and through introduction new mechanisms to control parental fees.  </p>  <p>  It may be of interest to the Deputy to know that there is significant material relating to Core Funding available at www.first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/Core-Funding/. This public material was prepared in response to a number of queries received by my Department, including some of which are raised by the FECP. </p>  <p>  The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, educators and practitioners, and society overall. </p>  <p>  This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. </p>  <p>  It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.</p></reply>

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.</p><p>Core Funding is the new funding stream to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.</p><p>Core Funding is distributed in a fair and reasonable manner that is related to services&rsquo; costs of delivery.  Core Funding is allocated to services based on the number of child places being made available (whether filled or not), the age group of children for whom the places are available and the number of hours the places are available for, as well as the graduate qualifications of leaders in the service.  These are the primary drivers of services costs and this is therefore the most proportionate and transparent manner to allocate funding.</p><p>Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly. No service will lose out.</p><p>The formula for distributing funding to services is based on the statutory adult: child ratios that underpin the type of provision being offered.  Full day services are required to operate to lower adult: child ratios outside of the delivery of the ECCE programme than sessional pre-school services so consequently the allocation for this type of provision is higher on a per place, per hour basis.  </p><p>In fact, the value of funding offered is weighted in favour of sessional services for 2.5-6 year-olds. ECCE services receive proportionately more than other types of services relative to the staffing requirements of sessional pre-school provision. </p><p>It is important to acknowledge that Core Funding will intentionally address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision as well as graduate Managers. Core Funding also replaces ECCE higher capitation and distributes public funding in respect of graduate staff more fairly across ELC provision.</p><p>Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening for longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher. The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity - the opening hours, opening weeks and the age group of children for whom services are provided as well as number of places available. This &euro;183 million includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million). It is important to note that both contact and non-contact time, holiday pay, sick pay and other employer costs, are all factored in to the estimated staff costs allocation in Core Funding.</p><p>In addition, a further &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the ECCE programme. The Graduate Lead Educator Premium in Core Funding is paid as a top up on the number of hours of provision that is led by a graduate. The Graduate Manager Premium is paid as a top up on the number of hours of operation of a service whose manager is a graduate.</p><p>Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance. Providers will have a stable income source based on the service they deliver. Allocating Core Funding based on capacity in this way also closely links the level of funding available to the delivery costs for different types provision.</p><p>In response to queries received by my Department on a number of matters, including the impact of Core Funding on different service types, detailed information relating to Core Funding is now available at .  </p><p>City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) have received training in order to assist providers in calculating their potential Core Funding allocations. I would encourage providers to contact their local CCC for guidance and support in understanding the impacts and benefits of Core Funding for their service. Contact details for CCCs are available at <i>myccc.ie/where-is-my-nearest-ccc and providers can reach out for support at any time</i>. </p><p>The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall. This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers. </p><p>I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.</p></reply>

Advice received on this issue points to reasonable profit consisting of the level of return from risk-free investment (swap rates) plus a modest premium. The historically low swap rates that have been in place for many years in the Euro zone suggest that the reasonable profit rate that should apply in order for the Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI) exemption to be effective would therefore also be quite low. </p>  <p>  The consideration of a sector-wide reasonable profit rate in the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) sector requires further detailed analysis, including in relation to the structure of the sector and the level of risk attaching to investment, which will vary by service location and service type.  An estimation of reasonable profit for ELC/SAC provision in Ireland would be required to consider what the profit might be required to cover; the timeframes required for obtain a return; the drivers of risk; and the costs of capital.</p>  <p>  It may also be of interest to the Deputy to be aware that the 'Independent Review of the Cost of Providing Quality Childcare Services in Ireland', published in October 2020 and the 'Analysis of the Rate of Surplus for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare Services in Ireland', published in October 2021, provide relevant information and insight. </p>  <p>  The sectoral information on rate of surplus in ELC and SAC in Ireland suggests that, on the whole, there are not excessive profits in the sector. However, there are significant variations across different types of provision. For example, the evidence suggests that ECCE-only services see the highest levels of income in excess of costs compared to other types of provision.  The sector average rate of surplus is 4% whereas the characteristics associated with ECCE provision indicate surplus rates of between 14% and 23%.</p>  <p>  The collection of information on income and costs is essential for the full understanding of this complex and diverse sector in order to inform the development of policy. This is recommended by an Expert Group in their report, 'Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model For Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare'. </p>  <p>  This income and cost information and analysis was important in securing significant additional public investment in Budget 2022, specifically the new Core Funding package which amounts to &euro;221 million in full year costs (&euro;173 million of which is new investment). </p>  <p>  I am pleased to report that the recent data collection for the Annual Sector Profile, including questions on income and costs, has already been completed by 83% of services and I understand that a further cohort of providers have sought an option to return a completed survey at a later point. </p>  <p>  I am encouraged that providers have shown a willingness and openness to work in partnership with the State towards the shared goal of delivering high quality and affordable ELC and SAC for families, for the public good. The high level of participation in the Sector Profile survey bodes well for the future of the sector as we move towards greater public investment and public management. </p></reply>

Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC).</p><p>Early years educators, school-age childcare practitioners and childminders play a key role in supporting children&rsquo;s development and well-being, working in partnership with families. Recognising their central importance for the quality of provision, Nurturing Skills aims to support the professional development of the workforce and raise the profile of careers in the sector. </p><p>Nurturing Skills sets out actions to achieve workforce commitments in First 5, the Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, including: </p><p>Achieving a graduate-led workforce in ELC by 2028, with new financial supports to assist Early Years Educators to study while continuing to work in the sector;</p><p>Supporting School-Age Childcare Practitioners to meet new qualification requirements that willbe introduced incrementally over the coming years; </p><p>Development of a career framework and strengthening career pathways, including new supports for leadership development;</p><p>Building a national infrastructure for Continuing Professional Development for the sector; and </p><p>Supporting staff recruitment, retention and diversity in the workforce.</p><p>A comprehensive implementation plan was developed as part of the drafting of Nurturing Skills which covers the first phase of implementation from 2022-2024. A Monitoring Committee is being established with the task of monitoring the implementation of this plan.</p><p>In Budget 2022, I announced a new Core Funding stream which will provide an additional &euro;69m of funding in 2022 and is equivalent to more than &euro;207 million in a full year.  Core Funding is expected, among other objectives, to support the delivery of Nurturing Skills through supporting the employment of graduate staff and through supporting an Employment Regulation Order that may arise from the Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services, improving workforce recruitment and retention through improvement in pay and conditions.</p></reply>

Initial information about the scheme was made available as part of the Budget FAQ: at <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/b3e97-budget-2022-overview-and-faqs-for-early-learning-and-care-elc-and-school-age-childcare-sac-providers-and-parents/</i>.</p><p>This was followed in December with the publication of the report of an Expert Group, <i>Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare. </i>The report sets out extensive detail for the rationale for the introduction of Core Funding along with specific recommendations for implementation which have been accepted by Government.  The report is available here: </p><p>Extensive information was communicated to the sector on 7th March, including detail on the way in which Core Funding will be allocated to individual services. A Ready Reckoner was also launched to assist providers in estimating the potential value of Core Funding for their individual service, as well as to test different scenarios.  A detailed FAQ was published at this time which is available here: <i>earlyyearshive.ncs.gov.ie/how-to-guides/faqs/faq-rr/DCEDIY-FAQ-for-Ready-Reckoner.pdf</i>.</p><p>In response to a number of queries received by my Department, officials have produced public information relating to Core Funding for the whole sector. This information was published on 14th April at <i>www.first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/core-funding/</i>and addresses many of the frequently asked questions around Core Funding and the New Funding Model. </p><p>The Core Funding contract will be published in June so applicants can review what they will later be asked to sign in August. The application form will also be available in June along with a new FAQ. Payments to providers will commence at the end of August.  </p><p>The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall. </p><p>This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. </p><p>It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.</p><p>I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.</p></reply>

It provides student-facing educational resources to nearly all Irish HEIs and staff training. Beginning in 2013, the programme scaled up between 2019/2023 with philanthropic donor support, to provide the HE sector with a robust, research-informed portfolio of interactive workshops, theatre and drama resources, social media campaigns, and staff training initiatives. This is provided free of charge to the sector.</p><p>The programme supports HEI consent programme implementation, particularly First Year orientation programmes. Additional supports are provided on sexual violence and harassment (awareness raising, disclosure training, etc.), with partners including Galway Rape Crisis Centre. Other programmes and agencies work in the sector as well e.g. UCC Bystander Programme, TCD&rsquo;s consent programme, etc.</p><p>The programme bases its work on an ecological model of campus culture change, creating baseline and evaluative research, awareness, education, and training resources, policy maker engagement, and national dissemination of findings. Its goals are to:</p><p>Empower young people to have positive, confident sexual health and wellbeing;</p><p>Enable stakeholders such as professionals, parents, and policy makers to engage in development through capacity building; and</p><p>Support sustainable systems by addressing consent, sexual violence and harassment through research, prevention, and education.</p><p>Some of the programme&rsquo;s key outreach statistics include:</p><p>Over 250 staff members and students are trained annually in facilitating consent workshops. Since 2016, over 1,000 staff and students have taken part.</p><p>In the year before the pandemic (Academic Year 2019/20), almost 10,000 college students took part in face-to-face consent workshops or consent dramas. </p><p>During the pandemic, the 3-part online student consent programme comprised: (a) An online consent workshop, (b) Self-directed brief eLearning resource (key definitions, peer support through signposting/interpersonal communication skills, bystander intervention, knowledge of supports/services, etc.), and (c) Ongoing messaging, delivered through campus campaigns and paid social media.</p><p>Over 250,000 students were targeted in the paid social media &lsquo;Start Here&rsquo; campaign (Q1, 2021). </p><p>In Academic Year 2020/21, 17,010 First Year students took part in online workshops. The comparable 2021/22 figure is 16,075 so far (May 2022).</p><p>Positive feedback includes 84% of students recommending the workshop to peers.</p><p>Student leader / staff training initiatives include education briefings, seminars, and Consent Ambassador training.</p><p>A schools programmes was launched in 2021/22 and works with the Further Education sector, promoting an integrated societal approach.</p><p>The live drama performance will recommence on campuses in Academic Year 2022/23.</p><p>Additional outreach development crucially depends on enhanced support and resourcing at all levels in HEIs.</p><p>I hope the above is of assistance in terms of providing an overview of the ongoing activities of the programme to which the Deputy refers and its engagement with my Department. </p></reply>

In 2021, a record 8,607 new apprentices were registered, this was an almost 40% increase on the figures from 2019, the last &ldquo;normal&rdquo; pre-pandemic year. 6,955 of these registrations were in craft apprenticeships.

An approximate indicative trend has been mapped as follows - ~6,450 in 2021, ~7,500 in 2022, ~8,300 in 2023, ~9,100 in 2024, and ~10,000 in 2025 (the target year). The associated forecasted overall apprentice population figures would correspondingly be ~22,000 in 2021, ~23,000 in 2022, ~25,000 in 2023, 28,000 in 2024, and ~30,000 in 2025.</p><p>However, in terms of comparing the forecasts against the actuals, the background of Covid restrictions over 2020-21 has had a major impact. This resulted in a significant impact on registrations, as well as impacts from the closing of training centres, and the closures of the construction sector.</p><p>It is too early to tell if these figures will sustain going forward. The sector may well experience further variations and corrections on an annual basis, but the <i>Action Plan for Apprenticeship</i>remains focused and committed to the target of reaching 10,000 registrations per annum by 2025.</p></reply>

This comprises State funding of tuition costs amounting to &euro;357m per annum for 146,000 eligible higher education students and &euro;190m paid by the Exchequer under the Student Grant Scheme in respect of all or some of the &euro;3,000 student contribution which benefits over 65,000 eligible students.</p>  <p>  The student contribution costs as shared between the students and the state is a significant element of the overall income of our higher education institutions. In this regard the student contribution rate requires consideration in the context of a sustainable model of funding for higher education.  </p>  <p>  On May 4th I launched Funding the Future &ndash; the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future of higher education. Funding the Future settles the question on funding Higher Education. The Government has decided that income contingent loans for fees will not form part of the future funding model. Instead, the Government is committing to a multi-funded model of additional Exchequer investment and employer contributions through the National Training Fund.</p>  <p>  The policy sets out the vision and direction of higher education funding, our commitment to addressing legacy issues in higher education and detailing our ambitious plans for investment and reform. This includes: </p>  <p>  - planned additional investment of &euro;307 million to address core funding challenges for our institutions, that will be made over a number of years through annual budgetary processes. This does not account for future demographic needs or new policy proposals for higher education. </p>  <p>  - Plans to consider options to address cost as a barrier to higher education, and how we will pursue funding measures on these issues through the Estimates process, including in respect of reductions to the student contribution and enhancements to the SUSI grant in line with the Student Grant Review.</p>  <p>  As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the issue in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly across society.</p>  <p>  I intend to publish, during the Summer in advance of each year&rsquo;s Estimates process, a paper outlining potential options and impacts, to be considered in the Budgetary process, related to the Student Grant scheme and other programmes related to student supports and costs of higher education, including with respect to those priorities identified in the Student Grant Scheme Review.</p></reply>

Part-time courses are not currently eligible for support under the scheme. In 2021 I approved a review of the Student Grant Scheme to ensure that adequate student supports are in place, alongside the sustainable funding model for the sector. One of the recommendations from the DG Reform&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme is the need for a policy proposal for the re-design of the higher education funding system in Ireland that would provide equity in access, efficiency in the investment of public resources and sustainability in the face of strong demographic growth. </p><p>The Student Grant Scheme review raised the issue of flexible learning citing that many socio economically disadvantaged students would have considered part-time if the option had been available to them. This aligns with the findings of the consultation undertaken for the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education which identified the need for the sector to provide flexible learning options for people disadvantaged by socio-economic barriers, mature students, students with a disability and members of the travelling community. </p><p>I officially launched both reports on May 4<sup>th</sup>and am committed to implementing the recommendations in a phased way, in the context of successive annual Estimates processes. This summer in advance of the Estimates process,  I intend to publish a paper outlining potential options and impacts, to be considered in the Budgetary process, related to the Student Grant scheme and other programmes related to student supports and costs of higher education, including with respect to those priorities identified in the Student Grant Scheme Review.</p><p>The issue of potentially expanding part-time delivery of tertiary education in Ireland is a complex one and significant planning will need to be conducted at both national and institution level to manage the significant supply-side impacts on educational institutions.<b>An internal working group will be established within my Department to support lifelong learning and explore the extension of financial supports to include part-time students. </b></p><p>Part-time students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials. Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award (NQF level 6-10) in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF. </p><p>Also, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this relief is available from a student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the Bill will include a provision to enable the operation of disease-specific &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; registries, including a virtual national diabetes registry, where information on disease diagnoses and treatment from healthcare providers is efficiently collated, combined and quality-checked from administrative records to create a database akin to an active registry for each disease.

As you may be aware, the current public pay agreement, Building Momentum, includes the process of Sectoral Bargaining, to address outstanding claims such as this one. The MLSA were granted their own bargaining unit to progress this claim. The size of the Sectoral Bargaining fund available to the MLSA, and to all other cohorts of staff bound by this Agreement, equates to 1% of their basic pay. The MLSA and Health management have been engaged in talks over the last number of months with the aim of finding a way to advance their claim for pay parity through the Sectoral Bargaining process.</p><p>The Public Service Agreement Group (PSAG), comprised of union and civil service representatives with an independent chair, met on May 11<sup>th</sup>to consider this matter.

It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day. </p><p>I would also like to remind the Deputy that it is against Department policy to comment on individual cases. </p></reply>

Examples of health technologies include medicinal products, medical equipment, diagnostic and treatment methods, rehabilitation, and prevention methods. Its aim is to inform the formulation of safe and effective health policies, investment and reimbursement decisions that are patient focused and seek to achieve best value. </p>  <p>  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) are the two agencies primarily responsible for the undertaking of HTA in Ireland. </p>  <p>  HIQA conducts HTAs of health technologies to inform national health policy and national health service decisions at the request of the Minister for Health and the HSE. This is conducted in line with a prioritisation process. HIQA constitutes an expert advisory group (EAG) for each HTA with a multidisciplinary membership, including relevant clinical expertise and patient and public representation. The EAG provides input throughout the process and reviews the draft HTA report. Once developed the HTA work programme is approved by the Board of HIQA. Final HTA reports are submitted to the decision maker and published on the HIQA website.  </p>  <p>  The NCPE was established in 1998 and its remit is to advise the HSE and the Department of Health in relation to the cost-effectiveness of medicines, through the carrying out of HTAs. The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of all medicines. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the NCPE. The NCPE conducts HTAs for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. </p>  <p>  Following a tender by the Office of Government Procurement, Mazars conducted a review of the governance structures around the HSE's drug reimbursement process. The report was submitted to the Department in January 2020. The review made recommendations in respect of the HSE&rsquo;s systems, structures, processes, governance arrangements and use of specialist resources in respect of the drug reimbursement process.</p>  <p>  The report was under consideration by officials, however the focus of the Department of Health changed to the immediate public health considerations of the COVID-19 pandemic and the preservation of life. This meant that this work stream was suspended to reallocate resources to support essential services. The Department aims to complete its consideration of the report&rsquo;s recommendations when resources permit.</p></reply>

These aids and appliances are provided by the HSE through community services known as Community Funded Schemes.</p>  <p>  Each Community Health Organisation (CHO) operates processes for the allocation of funding for medical and surgical aids and appliances. Each application within a CHO is assessed by the local Resource Allocation Group and a determination is made regarding approval based on clinical priority and funding availability within local budgets.</p>  <p>  At times, due to the demand for resources exceeding the available capacity, waiting lists may apply for some categories of items provided through the medical and surgical aids and appliances budget in a particular CHO. Waiting times for items approved for funding vary depending on the priority rating and priority is given to clients with the greatest level of clinical need. The HSE have advised that clinical demands on the local budget remain high.</p>  <p>  The HSE have confirmed that the application for a new wheelchair was considered by the local Resource Allocation Group on 31 of March 2022 and was subsequently included on a waiting list.</p></reply>

This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. </p>  <p>  It is noted that some 500 procedures and treatments will be available in the new elective care centres within a defined set of specialities, including gynaecology and the business case for same is progressed through the PSC.  Accordingly, a stand-alone dedicated elective gynaecology hospital is not Government/Departmental or HSE policy and no such proposal has been considered, costed or evaluated. In addition, gynaecology has been identified as one of three priority areas in the Waiting List Action Plan (along with paediatric orthopaedics and bariatric / obesity treatments) for which &euro;15m for this service area has been allocated to reduce waiting lists. The 2022 Waiting List Fund will enable the expansion of gynaecology ambulatory care in Tallaght, will provide access to additional theatre capacity for gynaecology activity in the Coombe and will provide additional IPDC capacity at CUMH through increased theatre sessions.</p></reply>

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p><p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which help to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.</p><p>  Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. It should be noted that in November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card.</p><p>  With regard to the estimated cost of the deputy's proposal, the data required to model this is not readily available and it is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the associated cost.</p><p>However, I wish to assure the Deputy that, to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, my Department keeps medical card issues, including the current medical card income thresholds under review and any changes are considered in the context of Government policy, the annual budgetary estimates process and other issues which may be relevant.</p></reply>

It takes a life course approach, acknowledging the importance of developing a healthy attitude to sexuality in young people and of building on that foundation for positive sexual health and wellbeing into adulthood and older age. </p>  <p>  Current priority deliverables under the Strategy are HIV prevention, including the continued expansion of a Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) programme, which commenced in late 2019, and the HIV Fast Track Cities programme, involving Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.</p>  <p>  Other key areas of work include expanding access to contraception, free of charge; expanding sexually transmitted infection (STI) services, progressing a population survey on sexual health and improving sexual health education, training and resources, including in schools, higher and further education.</p>  <p>  A review of the Strategy began in 2021, having been postponed as a result of the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Focus group meetings were held with key stakeholders, including clinical and public health staff, the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) team, those working in STI clinics, the education sector, the Department of Health and Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, the research and academic sector and organisations representing the LGBTI+ community.</p>  <p>  The detailed feedback from these meetings has been collated and will inform the future direction of the next iteration of the strategy. Commissioning an external review of the Strategy has been approved and is currently progressing through standard procurement processes. It is envisaged that the procurement process will conclude by July, with the Review to take 3-4 months once commenced. When complete, the Report will be published on the Healthy Ireland website. Results will, in turn, inform future policy direction and the Women's Health Taskforce will continue to provide input as the policy is implemented. </p>  <p>  Funding to support implementation of NSHS is provided to the HSE SHCPP as part of the annual Budget process. An additional &euro;3.3m was allocated in Budget 2022 for the expansion of online STI testing and for continuation of two other Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund projects. supporting sexual health services in Athlone Institute of Technology and north inner-city Dublin. Of further relevance to sexual and reproductive healthcare and services, &euro;9m was also provided for the rollout of free contraception for women aged 17-25, as per the Programme for Government Commitment. This is scheduled to commence in August, 2022</p>  <p>  Funding for the next iteration of the NSHS will be considered as part of the annual Budgetary process and will be contingent on, firstly, the recommendations of the forthcoming external review, secondly, monitoring and evaluation of existing and new 2022 initiatives and finally, public health considerations relating to STI prevention and treatment. </p></reply>

The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.</p>  <p>  Initial funding of &euro;2m was assigned in order to commence Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care in 2020 and additional funding of approximately &euro;1m was made available for 2021. These allocations were utilised to enable the setting-up of the Regional Fertility Hubs. According to figures updated by NWIHP in 2021, the total full-year cost of fully operating the six Hubs is estimated to be in the region of &euro;2.87m.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system. Substantial planning, development and policy work is required to establish the scope, design and requirements for this component of the model of care. At this juncture, the design and scope of this aspect of the model of care have not been finalised as detailed consideration of a range of issues including service and treatment design, eligibility and access criteria, and associated resource implications is required. This work will also need to be informed by the final Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Act, the progress of this Bill &ndash; which has recently passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il &ndash; and associated regulations that will be developed following the enactment of this legislation. My officials are continuing engagement with the HSE in relation to the necessary programmes of work required to further advance consideration of the issues arising for commencing Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care. </p>  <p>  Finally, in respect of surrogacy services, Part 7 of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 outlines the proposed circumstances under which domestic surrogacy will be permitted in Ireland. The proposed specific conditions include a requirement for all surrogacy agreements to be altruistic and authorised by the new Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority prior to the provision of AHR treatment. The surrogate mother and the intending parent(s) must have provided fully-informed consent to the surrogacy agreement, have received appropriate counselling specific to surrogacy, and the surrogate mother must have been assessed as being both physically and psychologically suitable to act as a surrogate mother. The scope of surrogacy related-services, if any, that may be incorporated into the model of care for infertility will be considered as part of the above-mentioned programmes of work. </p></reply>

These Hubs aim to maximise the outcome for women and their partners by offering an assessment and management service on-site that will streamline the process and minimise delays in access to fertility services. </p>  <p>  These Hubs offer a tailored, multi-disciplinary approach. Patients are referred, if they meet the relevant criteria, by their GPs to their local Hub, which is being resourced so that it has available specific expertise in this area from a medical perspective, a nursing perspective and a laboratory perspective. </p>  <p>  Following the provision of funding in 2020 and again in 2021, six Regional Fertility Hubs have been established and are now operational in the National Maternity Hospital, the Rotunda, the Coombe, Cork University Maternity Hospital, University Hospital Galway and at Nenagh General Hospital (under the governance of University Maternity Hospital Limerick).  </p></reply>

The State is not funding advanced AHR treatment at present and we do not have a specific regulatory framework in place in respect of this area of health care. This means that individuals are currently availing of complex and sometimes risky procedures without the benefit of a regulatory framework.</p><p>The new rules, regulations and provisions that will be provided through this legislation will help bring guidance, clarity and peace of mind.</p><p>Post-commencement of the Act, the main ensuing budgetary requirements will relate to the establishment and running costs of the Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority (AHRRA for short). </p><p>A Regulatory Impact Analysis in respect of the AHRRA was undertaken in 2017 and it estimated the combined set-up and operational costs for one year as being between &euro;1.6m and &euro;2.5m, dependent primarily on the level of functions or services the new body may share with another public body or other public bodies. The budgetary requirements for the AHHRA will be kept under ongoing consideration as more detailed planning for the establishment of the Authority progresses and, having regard to amendments, if any, to the proposed legislation that may impact on the AHRRA as the Bill progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p></reply>

Not all women experiencing menopause may be clinically eligible for HRT, which is prescription based. Women may also choose not to take HRT and to address their symptoms through alternative therapies and/or lifestyle changes.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the provision of HRT under the the statutory schemes cost &euro;5.4m. This cost was broken down between &euro;3.9m under the General Medical Services (medical card) scheme and &euro;1.5m under the Drug Payment Scheme.</p>  <p>  The HSE do not have access to data on the expenditure of patients receiving products privately in community pharmacies or whose expenditure for medicines falls below the threshold of the Drug Payment Scheme. This prevents the HSE from giving a robust estimation of the costs of providing HRT free to all who may need it. However, the HSE have estimated that the cost to the state would likely be &euro;8.2m per annum, at a minimum. This estimation does not take account of any associated loss of prescription charge income or any demographic changes that could impact on uptake.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the supply issues that have arisen in the provision of HRT and is doing all it can to address these. When supply issues arise for individual medicines, different options, including alternative brands or generic medicines, should be made available to ensure continuity of treatment. Pharmacies should also ensure the equitable supply of medicines to their customers, within their available stock. If a patient has concerns, they should discuss their treatment and alternative options with their doctor, pharmacist or other healthcare professional. </p></reply>

BreastCheck invite this age category because international evidence shows the incidence and mortality from breast cancer in this age group means it is effective to screen women in this age range.  The National Screening Service (NSS) also advises that BreastCheck delivers its services in line with international criteria for screening programmes, based on the best international evidence, which they kept under constant review.</p><p>The BowelScreen programme invite men and women aged 60 to 69, for bowel screening. The programme are aiming to offer bowel screening to all people aged 55 to 74, which is part of their commitment in Ireland&rsquo;s National Cancer Strategy and in line with commitments in the Programme for Government.</p><p>It is important to be aware any further decisions about changes to our national screening programmes, such as widening the age eligibility or changes to screening tests, will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC). This independent expert group considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria. It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms. </p><p>A dedicated evidence assessment team in HIQA support the work of the NSAC and conduct evidence reviews and evaluations to inform the decisions of the NSAC. The financial cost is but one factor that is considered in the decision-making process. Due to the complex nature of the evaluation process and the criteria against which a decision is made, it would not be possible to accurately quantify the cost of expanding a screening service until a full evidential assessment was completed.</p><p>It may be of interest to note that the NSAC held its first 'Annual Call&rsquo; in 2021, which gave the public an opportunity to suggest new screening programmes or modifications to existing ones.  The Committee are currently reviewing the submissions received and I am looking forward to receiving recommendations from the NSAC once they have been considered fully. I will be guided by their advice to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s population-based screening programmes continue to evolve in line with new evidence and developments.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.</p><p>  The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p><p>  However, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years. With regard to the estimated cost of providing a medical card in the manner sought, this information is not readily available and it is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the cost of the proposal. </p></reply>

Commencing in 2014, the broad objectives of this Research Programme are to apply economic analysis to explore issues in relation to health services, health spending and population health, in order to inform the development of health policy and the Government&rsquo;s healthcare reform agenda. </p><p>As part of the 2022 work programme agreed by the Research Programme Steering group, one topic of research concerns a profile of health, healthcare use, and healthy behaviours across socioeconomic groups in Ireland using Healthy Ireland Survey (HIS) data.  The health measures analysed in this report will be self-reported health, health illnesses and multimorbidity. The healthcare use measures analysed will be GP visits per annum, practice nurse visits per annum, inpatient hospital nights and emergency department attendances. The healthy behaviour measures analysed will be<b></b>smoking, exercise and excessive alcohol consumption. </p><p>An age and gender profile will be created for each measure while an age and gender profile for deprivation quintiles will also be estimated. This will provide information how health, healthcare use, and healthy behaviours differ across socioeconomic groups In Ireland. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As part of '<i>Our Rural Future'</i><b><i>,</i></b>the Government is committed to ensuring that the Local Improvement Scheme is funded into the future. </p><p>The determination of eligibility and subsequent prioritisation and selection of LIS roads is a matter for the relevant local authority. Selected roads are included in a priority list of roads provided to my Department. In some instances, a road included on a priority list may not be delivered and may be substituted by one or more roads on a &ldquo;secondary list&rdquo; provided by the Local Authority. </p><p>In 2018, 144 LIS roads were completed in Mayo. I understand that the road referred to by the Deputy was one of a total of 11 approved roads on the priority list in County Mayo which did not proceed. The funding available for these roads was reallocated to 13 roads on the secondary list provided by Mayo County Council.  The road referred to by the Deputy was originally selected for works totaling &euro;34,890.</p><p>A short section of this road referred to by the Deputy was again included on the priority list from Mayo County Council in 2020. The Local Authority has indicated that the works on this shorter section of the road involved a higher standard of finish than was envisaged in 2018 and was funded in the amount of  &euro;29,602.</p><p>My officials requested a written report from the relevant local authority in respect of the road in question. The material received referenced a number of engineering constraints linked to the proposed works.  Following the commitment I gave to have this matter reviewed, my Department identified that the local contributors requested to raise the road level to protect against tidal flooding. </p><p>As the road was located in a Special Protection Area (SPA), works would require an environmental  screening assessment. An ecologist report would be required in advance of works and a foreshore licence would also be required. The proposed  works would necessitate the construction of a safety barrier. The local authority has confirmed that the considerable additional resources required could not be met from within the Local Improvement Scheme. It was, however, agreed with the applicants that a regular overlay would be applied to the road as these  works would not required screening. </p></reply>
