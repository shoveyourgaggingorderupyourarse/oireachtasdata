These were constructive engagements with each of the party leaders and I emphasised that the two-year absence of the devolved institutions cannot be allowed to continue. There are pressing decisions and issues across a range of areas, which require a functioning Executive and Assembly. Each of the party leaders confirmed to me their wish to participate in the institutions again and provided views on key concerns and issues for their parties. </p>  <p>  Both Governments are determined to find a way beyond the current impasse to get the institutions operating again and I remain in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on how this can be pursued. </p>  <p>  Following these latest consultations, I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving a resolution, but I continue to believe that this can be achieved and that there is an increasingly urgent need for talks to begin. Secretary of State Bradley and I will meet again this week to discuss the way forward.</p>  <p>  The devolved institutions of the Agreement are urgently needed so that the Assembly and power-sharing Executive can represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland and address issues of concern, including the challenges for Northern Ireland resulting from the UK decision to exit the European Union. The North South Ministerial Council is also essential to oversee and develop North South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The legislation that was brought forward by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, which temporarily suspends the requirement to call an Assembly election, underlines the urgent requirement for all with responsibilities to do everything in their power to get them operating again.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Secretary of State and remain in regular contact with the leaders of each of the political parties, to get the necessary political process underway to secure an agreement for a functioning Executive and Assembly and NSMC.</p></reply>

These include a postal application system, an online passport application service, and a counter service for applicants who have immediate travel plans.</p>  <p>  The current waiting times for postal applications through the postal application system, Passport Express, will depend on the category of application.</p>  <p>  Renewal applications are currently being processed in 13 working days. First time applications, or those applicants who are applying to replace a lost or stolen passport are being processed in 15 working days.</p>  <p>  I would like to remind Deputies that the Passport Service recently expanded its online renewal service to include renewal of children's passports, as well as of adults. The online service brings significant benefits for citizens with faster turnaround times of 10 working days for all online applications, excluding postage.  In addition, the cost of renewing a passport online is cheaper than alternative methods, with fees for all online applications being reduced by &euro;5 across all application types.</p>  <p>  As the online service is the most convenient and most efficient method of renewing a passport, I would urge all applicants who are eligible to do so, to consider using this application channel.  </p></reply>

This includes well established rules with regard to ensuring a level playing field. Northern Ireland would remain aligned to those rules of the Single Market that are indispensable to avoiding a hard border. As regards the movement of animals and agricultural products between North and South, this provides for complete regulatory alignment, including with respect to SPS controls, and rules on agricultural production and marketing. </p>  <p>   I should be clear that the backstop acts simply as an insurance policy, which we hope will never have to be used. It remains our priority to achieve a future relationship agreement that can resolve all these issues, and obviate the need for the backstop.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the future relationship, both the EU and the UK have identified cooperation in the area of agriculture and trade in agri-food products as important aspects of the future trading relationship. Ireland wants the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, including in the area of trade, and in particular as regards agriculture and trade in agri-foods. This will be a priority for us in negotiations on the future relationship.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-29a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900059#WRB01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 79 together.</p>  <p>  I continue to be deeply concerned by the political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, which has had a grave impact on the Venezuelan people, and has resulted in mass migration, affecting countries in the region and overall regional stability. </p>  <p>  On 10 January, President Maduro started a new mandate on the basis of non-democratic elections held in May 2018. Ireland was not represented at the inauguration, and fully supports the declaration by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini of 10 January. This statement reiterates that the May 2018 Presidential election was neither free nor fair, and that its outcome lacked credibility. The statement also urges President Maduro to release all political prisoners, to uphold the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to urgently address the needs of the population.  </p>  <p>  I, alongside my EU partners, have repeatedly called on the Venezuelan Government to engage in dialogue with the opposition, to respect the electoral calendar and to fully restore the country&rsquo;s democratic institutions. It is regrettable that the Venezuelan Government has not heeded these calls for fresh presidential elections in accordance with internationally recognised democratic standards and the Venezuelan constitutional order.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to finding ways to foster shared democratic solutions that can bring political stability and address the pressing needs of the Venezuelan people. It is my continued belief that a credible, meaningful dialogue is the most effective way of achieving a peaceful solution to the current crisis in Venezuela. In that regard, Ireland regrets the negative impact the assumption of this new mandate may have on the possibility of achieving this negotiated solution. It will be vital that the EU remains engaged with all stakeholders in Venezuela.   </p>  <p>  The recent protests in Caracas are a demonstration of the Venezuelan people's will and their demand for democracy. It is imperative that the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are respected, and I wholly condemn the use of violence against these protesters by the Venezuelan authorities. I would like to offer my condolences to the families of those affected.  </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the statement made by High Representative Mogherini on 26 January, which reaffirms that a peaceful and inclusive democratic solution is the only sustainable way out of the current political and social crisis. The statement also reaffirms the full support of the EU to the democratically elected National Assembly, emphasising that its powers need to be restored and respected. The EU calls again for the urgent holding of free and fair Presidential elections in accordance with internationally democratic standards and the Venezuelan constitutional order. If no announcement regarding fresh elections is made over the coming days, the EU will take further actions regarding the issue of recognition of the country's leadership. Ireland stands firmly with our EU partners in support of this declaration. </p>  <p>  I welcome the high priority given to the issue by the EU, and I expect there will be further discussions on developments in Venezuela at the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council meeting in February. I believe that it is important for us to work in step with our like-minded regional partners.  </p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Mexico is responsible for our diplomatic relations with Venezuela and is monitoring the situation closely, engaging with partner organisations on the ground and with EU Missions in Caracas. Ireland will continue to engage regularly with our EU partners on this issue, as well as with affected countries in the region.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-29a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900059#WRB02100"><p>I am deeply troubled by the recent reports of 170 migrants missing in the Mediterranean Sea. Any death at sea is tragic.  </p>  <p>  Saving lives at sea is a priority for Ireland and for this reason we have been active in operations to tackle people-trafficking in the Mediterranean since 2015, first through Operation Pontus, a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Italy running in parallel to Operation Sophia. Ireland has been a full member of Operation Sophia since 2017. Since 2015, Irish naval vessels have rescued thousands of migrants in the Mediterranean.</p>  <p>  In June, the European Council reconfirmed that a precondition for a functioning EU policy on migration relies on a comprehensive approach to migration which combines effective controls of the EU's external borders, external action to strengthen co-operation with countries of transit and origin and dealing with the management of migrants within the European Union, where a balance of solidarity and responsibility is needed. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has provided humanitarian assistance in solidarity with other Member States on four separate occasions by making pledges to take migrants who were rescued in the Mediterranean Sea and to process their applications for international protection. On 9 January, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan TD, announced that Ireland will accept five unaccompanied minors from Malta as a gesture of solidarity and humanitarian assistance. </p>  <p>  Ireland also supports measures to address the root causes of irregular migration, through humanitarian and developmental programmes in developing countries. Indeed, Ireland&rsquo;s pledge of &euro;15 million for the EU&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Africa is the third highest per capita contribution by an EU Member State.  </p>  <p>  Solving the migration crisis will ultimately require deeper political, economic and development relationships between the EU and neighbouring countries, including many in Africa, that will form a basis for dealing with a variety of challenges on the basis of shared responsibility.</p></reply>

The EU and UK both accept that avoiding a hard border is essential. </p>  <p>  Throughout the negotiations it has been a priority to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and to ensure that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland under any circumstances. Naturally the counties of Cavan and Monaghan are included in this commitment, which is of very particular relevance to people and businesses there. Only the Withdrawal Agreement, with its backstop provisions, provides the essential legal guarantee to avoid a hard border in any circumstances and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.</p>  <p>  However, if the Withdrawal Agreement does not enter into force, Ireland and the EU will have responsibilities in terms of ensuring protection of the Single Market and Customs Union. The UK will have its own responsibilities, including meeting WTO requirements. As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, Ireland and the UK have solemn and binding obligations to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland. As such, whether the UK leaves with or without an agreement in place, we will all have to work together to ensure that we deliver on the shared goal of avoiding the return of a hard border.</p>  <p>  The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, understands the importance of these commitments, and he provided further reassurances on this in a phone call with the Taoiseach on 24 January. This position is fully shared by the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and our fellow EU 27 Member States. As the Commission spokesperson also stated on 23 January, the "EU is determined to do all it can, deal or no deal, to avoid the need for a border and to protect peace in Northern Ireland. The EU is fully behind Ireland and has expressed, on numerous occasions, full solidarity with Ireland. That has not changed."</p>  <p>  We are committed to doing all in our power to ensure that goal is met. But it is preferable for us all to resolve this now, as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement.</p></reply>

In 2018, we provided &euro;15.38 million in development and humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of the most vulnerable Palestinian men, women and children, our highest level ever.  </p>  <p>  In the T&aacute;naiste's recent visits to the region, he has witnessed first-hand the increasingly fragile humanitarian situation on the ground and the daily challenges for the Palestinian people, particularly in Gaza. The ongoing Gaza blockade and recurrent outbreaks of hostilities have eroded basic infrastructure, service delivery, livelihoods and coping mechanisms. It is clear that humanitarian needs in Gaza are critical and that all key services, particularly the health service, are under severe strain. </p>  <p>  Ireland has responded to the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people, including in Gaza, for many years. Our funding is channelled primarily through UN and multi-lateral partners. In 2018, we significantly increased our funding to the UN Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), providing an overall contribution of &euro;9 million, so that they could continue to provide basic services such as food aid, education and health to some 5.3 million registered Palestine refugees, 1.4 million of whom are in Gaza. This was an increase of &euro;3.5 million on their 2017 allocation.</p>  <p>  We also provided &euro;500,000 in 2018 to support the work of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territory. This included &euro;300,000 for the OCHA-managed Humanitarian Fund. The fund played a particularly important role in the international response to the injuries suffered by thousands of Gaza residents during the &ldquo;Great March of Return&rdquo; protests last year. </p>  <p>  In 2019, Ireland is committed to increasing our support to the Palestinian people. This will involve an expanded programme of scholarships for Palestinian students. I believe that Ireland can greatly increase its engagement with Palestine in this area. We are also working with the Palestinian Water Authority on the delivery of solar energy in Gaza to help alleviate the critical shortage of power there. This power shortage is crippling the Gazan economy and makes daily life and any form of economic activity very difficult and is one of the factors contributing to political instability. </p>  <p>  Issues related to the situation in Palestine, including the humanitarian situation in Gaza, are regularly discussed with our EU partners. The EU and its Member States are the largest contributors of assistance to the Palestinian people.  </p></reply>

We discussed the disappointing but not unexpected outcome of the 15 January vote in the House of Commons on the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. Both Mr Barnier and I are in agreement that what we need from the UK is clarity on how it proposes to move forward, and ultimately what it wants to achieve. The EU could then consider any next steps it might take. The EU continues to take a united approach to the negotiations and I thanked Mr Barnier for his unwavering support for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Mr Barnier and I remain firmly of the view that the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement as endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the British Government.  The European Council in December and the joint letter from Presidents Tusk and Juncker have provided reassurances with regard to the backstop. The European Council has made clear that it stands by the Withdrawal Agreement and that it is not open for renegotiation. The EU stands ready to work further on the Political Declaration as we look to the future relationship. </p>  <p>  I welcomed Mr Barnier&rsquo;s statement to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 16 January, in which he publicly reaffirmed his commitment to the backstop and to the Withdrawal Agreement as a whole, which represents the best possible compromise between the European Union and the United Kingdom. In our discussion, Mr Barnier and I agreed that it is the only agreement on the table that provides the essential legal guarantee to avoid a hard border in any circumstances and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. </p>  <p>  As Mr Barnier stated in Strasbourg, an orderly Brexit remains our top priority, but we must be prepared for all scenarios. In light of the ongoing uncertainty in Britain, the European Council has asked that preparedness work at the national and EU level intensify, taking account of all possible outcomes. I have outlined Ireland&rsquo;s approach in this regard to Mr Barnier, including planned legislation and other contingency measures. I also thanked Mr Barnier for the Commission&rsquo;s continued helpful and constructive engagement in this area, and their understanding of the particular challenges faced by Ireland.</p></reply>

Ireland has consistently supported the human rights of prisoners and detainees, and continually advocates for the freedom of civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment. </p>  <p>  Overall, through our engagement at the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, Ireland works tirelessly to promote gender equality, to combat all forms of discrimination against women and prevent gender-based violence.   </p>  <p>  Ireland has also co-sponsored resolutions at the Human Rights Council calling upon states to investigate alleged human rights violations and abuses suffered by persons deprived of their liberty, in particular cases involving death, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Ireland has also co-sponsored resolutions concerning human rights in the administration of justice, and resolutions concerning torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishments.   </p>  <p>  It is completely unacceptable that women should be imprisoned, let alone mistreated in any way, for peacefully seeking their basic rights. In December, the UN Committee against Torture cited serious allegations that a number of activists have been detained without charge in Dhahban prison since May 2018 and that they had suffered torture, sexual harassment and other forms of ill-treatment during interrogation. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have alleged shocking abuses subjected on these activists, which the Saudi government has vehemently denied.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Embassy in Riyadh regularly works with other EU Member States to ensure that human rights issues in Saudi Arabia are addressed, and the EU Delegation has raised the cases in question directly with the Saudi authorities on multiple occasions and at various levels. The EU Head of Delegation in Riyadh raised these reports last week.  </p>  <p>  On a national basis, Ireland consistently raises issues of human rights in Saudi Arabia with the Saudi Embassy in Dublin, and at international level. I understand that many members of the Oireachtas share my deep concerns, and that their status as parliamentarians will give them their own contacts and channels for highlighting these.    </p>  <p>  During the last Universal Periodic Review of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s human rights record at the Human Rights Council, in November 2018, Ireland registered its concern about the imprisonment of Human Rights Defenders and recommended that Saudi Arabia bring its laws into line with international standards for the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the cases in question, and continue to relay our concerns to the Saudi government, at bilateral, EU and international levels.</p></reply>

The Withdrawal Agreement, which was agreed  by the UK and EU in November and endorsed by the European Council on 25 November, fully reflects this through the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including its provision for a &ldquo;backstop&rdquo; on avoiding a hard border. This reflects the commitment provided by the UK in the joint progress report of December 2017 that it would maintain the full alignment with those rules of the EU's Customs Union and internal market necessary to protect North South cooperation, the all-island economy and the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  The UK is leaving the EU and that means that some changes are unavoidable. However, in addition to the guarantee on avoiding a hard border in all circumstances, the Protocol contains provisions on a number of important areas for Ireland, including provision for the maintenance of the Common Travel Area, that North South cooperation can continue and develop, and that the Single Electricity Market will be maintained on the island of Ireland. It also includes commitments to ensure no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good Friday Agreement and confirms that people in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens. The Protocol also makes clear that these arrangements fully respect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent under the Good Friday Agreement. All of this is aimed at ensuring that impact of Brexit on the everyday lives of people, both North and South, is minimised and that the status-quo on the island is protected. </p>  <p>  I have continued to engage directly with my EU counterparts, and with the Commission with regard to the ratification and implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement agreed between the EU and the British Government. On 21 January, I met with Michel Barnier, who expressed his ongoing support for our position on the backstop and agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement remained the best way to ensure an orderly UK withdrawal that fully protected the Good Friday Agreement.  He echoed his statements of 16 January; that the backstop must remain a backstop, and it must be credible. </p>  <p>  In all my meetings, I am struck by the continued solidarity and unity of our EU partners with Ireland on the issue of the backstop, and I am grateful for their continued public and private expressions of support.  </p>  <p>  Following the vote in Westminster on 15 January, and as the President of the Commission, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, has stated, what we need from the UK is clarity on how it proposes to move forward. We will then consider what next steps to take with our EU partners.</p></reply>

It is a priority for the Government, and for the Irish people, to do what we can to bring the Israel-Palestine situation to a resolution which is just and equitable for both peoples. </p>  <p>  With the political process having been at a standstill for some time, I have made my views clear that the international community needs to increase their engagement in order to move forward. Ireland has worked consistently, particularly at EU level, to maintain an international focus on the issue and support for the two state solution. The violent events in recent months have highlighted that the situation is only likely to deteriorate if solutions continue to be put off.   </p>  <p>  I have visited Israel and Palestine three times over the last eighteen months, holding meetings with the key interlocutors in both places, including both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu. These visits have allowed me to raise Ireland's priorities forthrightly and directly with the key decision makers, as well as listening to their concerns for the security and dignity of their peoples. I was also delighted to welcome President Abbas to Ireland in September, his first visit in ten years, during which he had good meetings with the President and the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  In December, Ireland proposed a Resolution at the UN General Assembly on a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. This Resolution, which reaffirmed the long-standing and broadly agreed parameters for a two-state solution to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, was adopted by an overwhelming majority of 156 UN states. Ireland has, and will continue, to take a firm stance on matters relating to the Palestinian people and the Middle East Peace Process.</p>  <p>  At Israel&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council last year, Ireland raised the continued expansion of settlements, and urged that Israel abide by its international legal obligations, including under the Fourth Geneva Convention, on the treatment of a civilian population under military occupation. I reiterated our concerns about these policies in my speech to the UN General Assembly in September. </p>  <p>  On the ground, Ireland works closely with like-minded countries to protect Palestinians in the West Bank from individual and mass forcible transfer, through the provision of humanitarian assistance. Ireland takes a leading role in coordinating advocacy on these issues. Ireland also provides significant humanitarian and development assistance to the Palestinian people, and I increased Ireland's contribution to UNRWA by &euro;3 million in 2018, in view of the strain it is under following the withdrawal of US support. I have also initiated new solar energy and scholarship programmes as a contribution to the development of the Palestinian people. </p>  <p>  However, I am all too aware that the pressure on Palestinian communities continues to grow. I have considered ways considered how the EU and the wider international community can productively engage and better use all the levers at our disposal to influence the parties to the conflict. I am convening a small gathering of European and Arab Foreign Ministers in Dublin in February, to discuss the Middle East Peace Process. Ireland will work with the Palestinians, as well as supportive Arab and European participants on discussing the current situation, longer term prospects and developments, and where best to go from here.</p></reply>

I remain concerned at reports of mining activities having a negative impact on local populations or on the environment, as well as of reported abuse of workers.  </p>  <p>  The EU Delegation in Bogot&aacute; has been monitoring the situation closely and the EU Head of Delegation has visited the Cerrej&oacute;n Mine in order to hear stakeholders' views on the allegations and to assess the situation on the ground.  Several follow-up meetings have taken place and the EU has maintained contact with representatives of sectoral trade unions and other civil society and environmental organisations.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is currently in the process of opening its first resident Embassy in Colombia, with Ambassador-designate Alison Milton having arrived in Bogot&aacute; earlier this month. This significant step demonstrates this Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with Colombia and in particular our commitment to supporting Colombia&rsquo;s transition to a peaceful post-conflict society, including the vindication and protection of human and social rights.  </p>  <p>  This, combined with the opening of the Colombian Embassy in Ireland last year, marks a period of exceptional relations between our two countries and will greatly enhance our ability to engage on issues on the ground. </p>  <p>  While our Embassy&rsquo;s focus will be on developing the political and economic relationship and on continuing to support Colombia&rsquo;s transition to a post-conflict society, having a permanent presence in Bogot&aacute; means that we will be much better positioned to monitor issues such as the impact of the Cerrej&oacute;n mine on the local community and the environment. </p>  <p>  Historic strides have been made in Colombia in recent years in the transition to a post-conflict society and addressing social and environmental issues is part of that process. Significant challenges remain, but Ireland remains committed to supporting the full implementation of the peace agreement, which will ensure a more peaceful, stable and prosperous future for all Colombians. </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor developments in the country and the particular issue raised by the Deputy as closely as possible. Officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin, and at our new Embassy in Bogot&aacute;, will continue to engage with human rights defenders and civil society organisations active on the ground, and with our EU colleagues in Bogot&aacute;.</p></reply>

The election will take place in the General Assembly of the United Nations in June 2020.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s candidature was announced in 2005 and the campaign is intensifying as the election date draws closer. There are two seats available on the Security Council for elected members of the Western Europe and Others Group (WEOG). Canada and Norway are the two other candidates for the 2021-2022 term. </p>  <p>  Our campaign to be elected to the UN Security Council was launched by the Taoiseach and I at the United Nations in New York in July 2018, with an event that highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to multilateral engagement, including our strong record of 60 years of unbroken peacekeeping service with the United Nations, our longstanding development programme and our consistent commitment in the areas of human rights, humanitarian relief and disarmament. </p>  <p>  I believe that Ireland&rsquo;s track record at the UN is widely recognised, along with our spirit of Empathy, Partnership and Independence which are keynotes of our Security Council campaign and which reflect our policy interests, our values and our history of positive engagement with the wider world.  </p>  <p>  Campaign costs to date have been approximately &euro;500,000, including the launch event at the United Nations in New York, travel and promotional materials. </p>  <p>  Alongside the Taoiseach and cabinet colleagues, I have utilised bilateral and multilateral meetings, and other international fora and engagements, to promote Ireland&rsquo;s candidature and make the case for the strong and independent role we would play on the Council.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department&rsquo;s  staff in Ireland, our Permanent Representation to the UN in New York, and our entire Embassy network have been actively presenting and highlighting our case and seeking support. UN Member States will be very aware of Ireland&rsquo;s candidature, our commitment to the United Nations and multilateralism and the values we seek to bring to the work of the Security Council.</p></reply>

We are well aware of the challenge faced by Turkey in July 2016, with the attempted coup d'&eacute;tat &ndash; but the state of emergency is over and the rule of law and freedom of expression must prevail.

Together with our European partners we have conveyed our concerns on the backsliding on the rule of law and fundamental rights; the deterioration of the independence and functioning of the judiciary; and the restrictions, detentions, imprisonments and other measures targeting parliamentarians, journalists, human rights defenders and others exercising their fundamental rights and freedoms. </p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that the Irish Government will continue to monitor developments in Turkey on the specific issue of the hunger strike, and also on the wider issues of human rights, freedom of expression, rule of law, and democracy.</p></reply>

I take this opportunity to reiterate that call. I also repeat my call on all parties with influence on the Syrian regime to exert that influence to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process.  </p><p>Ireland and the EU firmly believe that there can be no military solution to the Syria crisis. The misery caused by the long-running conflict in Syria has been further prolonged by military support which has been provided to the Assad regime. The EU&rsquo;s consistent position since the crisis began has been that the conflict can only be resolved by the Syrian people themselves. </p><p>Ireland and the EU strongly support the UN-led efforts to bring about a political resolution to the conflict. The EU provides direct assistance to the Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. EU Foreign Ministers met with former UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, in the margins of the 2018 UN General Assembly, and reaffirmed our strong support for his work and that of his team. The EU will continue engagement with the new UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen.  The UN Special Envoy&rsquo;s work to bring about an end the conflict is undertaken in accordance with the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and UN Security Council resolution 2254, which are clear on the need for this to be a Syrian-led political process. </p><p>We support the UN Special Envoy&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to establish a constitutional committee, made up of Syrians of different political views, to chart the way forward for the country. As part of his work to establish a constitutional committee, the UN Special Envoy has also been engaging directly with Russia, Turkey and Iran, and we believe that they have a responsibility to support and assist his efforts. </p><p><b></b>I do not condone or support the recent Israeli attacks into Syria. Nor do I support or condone the presence in Syria of other external<b></b>forces who have been assisting the regime in the violent suppression of its own people, and who have used Syrian territory to launch attacks into Israel. There are significant Iranian forces in Syria, which have been assisting the regime in the violent suppression of its own people. This is unhelpful and unwelcome. It is also quite clear that Russia&rsquo;s support for the Assad regime has prolonged the suffering of the Syrian people. Russia has also repeatedly vetoed UN Security Council resolutions on Syria, which has seriously undermined the protection of Syrian civilians. </p><p>Turkey has borne a heavy burden in terms of knock-on effects of the Syria conflict, including hosting millions of refugees, as well as a risk of spill-over of violence and its concern about the conflict raging on its southern border is understandable. However, our messages to Turkey, in relation to its operations in Syria, have emphasised our overarching concern for the protection of civilians, and urged caution to avoid escalating the conflict any further. Our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of civilians on both sides of the border, especially displaced and vulnerable communities, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds, all of whom are entitled to protection and safety.</p><p>I take this opportunity to reiterate my unreserved condemnation of the violence perpetrated against civilians that has characterized the Syrian conflict to date, most notably by the Government and its allies, and the appalling acts committed by Da'esh. </p><p>I expect that the upcoming EU-League of Arab States Ministerial meeting in February will provide an occasion to discuss the ongoing conflict in Syria with my EU counterparts, as well as with those neighbouring countries most directly affected by the crisis in Syria. </p></reply>

The Taoiseach, my cabinet colleagues and I take every opportunity to engage with EU partners to advance Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the Article 50 process. I, as well as officials from my Department, remain in ongoing contact with representatives from EU Member States, the Commission and Task Force, and the UK. </p>  <p>  I discuss Brexit collectively with my EU27 counterparts on a regular basis at the General Affairs Council (Article 50), where I take every opportunity to speak informally with them. I also regularly meet with my counterparts from other EU Member States, most recently the German Foreign Minister. In December I met with my Polish counterpart and I made clear to him the Irish and the European Council&rsquo;s position that the backstop cannot be a time-limited solution but that it, if triggered, it would be temporary unless and until it is superseded by a better solution. </p>  <p>  In all of these contacts, I am struck by the continued solidarity and unity of our EU partners with Ireland on the issue of the backstop, and I am grateful for their continued public and private expressions of support.   </p>  <p>  I met separately with Michel Barnier during the GAC (Article 50) meetings of 15 October and 12 November, and most recently on 21 January in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council. Mr Barnier reaffirmed his commitment to the backstop provisions contained in the Withdrawal Agreement, which is the only agreement on the table that provides the essential legal guarantee to avoid a hard border in any circumstances and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. The EU continues to take a united approach and I thanked Mr Barnier for his unwavering support for Ireland. The EU stands ready to work further on the Political Declaration as we look to the future relationship. </p>  <p>  The negotiations have been long and difficult, with flexibility and compromise shown on both sides. The European Council in December and the joint letter from Presidents Tusk and Juncker have provided important reassurances with regard to the backstop. They have also made clear that the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be renegotiated and that the European Union will not agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with it.</p></reply>

While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders maintain their commitment to its effective implementation. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.</p><p>Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. Since the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s visit to Addis Ababa in 2017, when he met representatives of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the African Union, Ireland has provided funding to IGAD to support negotiation of the peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring the implementation of the agreement in 2019.</p><p>Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key Government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place in November last year.</p><p>We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peacebuilding. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.</p><p>As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as Head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November 2018.</p><p>While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding was provided in 2018, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.</p><p>As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $178 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which provided more than &euro;90 million in 2018.</p><p>With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute throughout 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.</p></reply>

Member States focused on the importance of elevating EU-ASEAN relations to a Strategic Partnership and promoting the EU&rsquo;s approach to connectivity in ASEAN countries.</p>  <p>  Ministers also had an exchange of views on the EU's relations with the League of Arab States in preparation for the EU &ndash; League of Arab States Ministerial meeting planned for 4 February. </p>  <p>  The main focus of discussion at the Council was disinformation.  Ministers welcomed the EU Action Plan against disinformation and many emphasised the importance of focussing on its implementation, especially given the proximity of next May&rsquo;s European Parliament elections. Several Ministers highlighted the threat from Russia, but other actors were noted also. Some Ministers called for greater EU cooperation with other bodies e.g. the G7, and the importance of civil society was emphasised. There was also strong support for the work of the three EEAS Strategic Communications Task Forces which are working to identify, expose and counter disinformation. The EU will continue to work closely with online platforms, as well as to check the transparency of funding of political advertising, while at all times respecting freedom of expression.</p>  <p>  On the margins of the Council I had separate bilateral meetings with Michel Barnier and UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt in relation to Brexit.</p></reply>

We are also aware, and deeply troubled, by the grave human rights abuses that these migrants and refugees frequently suffer there. The Taoiseach highlighted these concerns when Libya was last discussed at the European Council. </p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council in December, my EU counterparts and I adopted Council Conclusions on Libya, committing to continue our work with the Libyan authorities to improve conditions for migrants and refugees, by ensuring aid reaches those in need of protection, and with a view to overcoming the current system of detention. </p>  <p>  The EU has mobilised &euro;286 million for migration-related projects in Libya since 2014. The majority of this funding comes from the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, and is dedicated to providing protection, assistance and alternatives to migrants in Libya. This funding also provides support for migrants at disembarkation points, inside and outside detention centres, or in host communities. These projects are implemented on the ground by international partners, including the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), or by EU Member States. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to tackling the root causes of migration and will provide a total of &euro;15 million over the period 2016-2020 to the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. The Trust Fund helps to address the root causes of migration generally, as well as providing protection and assistance to migrants and refugees in Libya. The EU also provides training (including on human rights and gender issues) and other support to Libyan authorities, to enhance Libya&rsquo;s border management capacities.</p>  <p>  Libyan detention centres are a focus of credible allegations of abuse and, at the very least, lack appropriate oversight. Alternatives to detention centres need to be established, in particular for vulnerable migrants, and Ireland calls on the Libyan authorities to continue to work with the relevant international organisations to make this possible.  </p>  <p>  Regrettably, political fragmentation and the fragile security situation in Libya limit the capacity of the international community to end abuses, since the internationally-recognised Libyan authorities, with whom the EU can work, may not have the capacity to effect this. There is a governance vacuum in many areas of the country, and access for international organisations seeking to monitor and alleviate conditions for migrants is restricted in many areas. Bringing real improvements to the lives of Libyans and migrants, and ensuring an end to human rights abuses, will require restoration of political stability, and a fully functioning and unified government. The EU will continue to work with the UN and others to support and reinforce Libya's sovereign institutions.</p></reply>

While overcoming the legacy of human rights crimes committed during the country&rsquo;s civil war remains a challenge, it is essential to Guatemala&rsquo;s future development. I urge the Government of Guatemala to address historical impunity at all levels and to fully investigate all incidents of violence, intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders, and to bring the perpetrators to justice.  </p>  <p>  To this end, the recent announcement of the Government of Guatemala that it would unilaterally terminate the 2006 Agreement with the UN establishing the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) is deeply regrettable. Ireland fully supports the declaration made by the EU High Representative/Vice President Federica Mogherini earlier this month which states that this announcement runs against Guatemala's legal obligations to the UN and against several rulings of the Constitutional Court, and calls on the Government to respect the country's constitutional order, in particular the independence of the Constitutional Court.  </p>  <p>  Since its establishment, the CICIG has been working effectively to combat corruption and impunity and to strengthen the rule of law in Guatemala.  I urge the Government to allow CICIG to continue its important work until the end of the current mandate in September 2019, respecting the integrity of CICIG national and international personnel and affording them all necessary protection.  </p>  <p>  The situation in Guatemala is discussed regularly at EU level, and officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also meet regularly with human rights defenders and civil society organisations active in Guatemala.  </p>  <p>  Ireland took the opportunity of the 28th Session of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council on 8 November 2017 to express its concern in relation to attacks against human rights defenders in Guatemala. Ireland also noted that there have been worrying instances of harassment, intimidation and criminalisation of human rights defenders in the country. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s statement recommended that Guatemala take all necessary steps to protect human rights defenders through the removal of legal and policy measures which inhibit the ability of human rights defenders to carry out their vital work in safety, without fear of interference, obstruction or harassment of any kind, including by finalising the Public Policy for the Protection of HRDs with strong participation by civil society and an adequate budgetary allocation</p>  <p>  While Ireland does not have a resident Embassy in Guatemala City, we will continue to follow the situation in Guatemala closely, and to raise our concerns regarding threats against human rights defenders in discussions on Guatemala at EU and international level, in keeping with our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and working with partners on the ground.</p></reply>

The Ministerial addressed the progress made since the EU-AU Summit in Abidjan in 2017, in cooperation on peace and security, trade relations and support for the multilateral system. Participants discussed the implementation of a Memorandum of Understanding on Peace, Security and Governance and the EU proposal for an Alliance for Sustainable Jobs and Investment. They renewed their commitment to hold regular Ministerial meetings in the lead up to the next EU-AU Summit in 2020, and issued a Joint Communiqu&eacute; reaffirming their commitment to work together to strengthen the relationship between our two continents.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s intervention highlighted the need for cooperation through all phases of the conflict cycle and, in particular, the need to concentrate on mediation and conflict prevention. It drew on our experience of peacebuilding and offered our support to those who wished to learn from our experience.</p></reply>

When the reports came to notice, senior officials of my Department met the Russian Ambassador to convey the grave concerns of the Government, and of the Irish public, at these reports. During the meeting, officials urged the Russian authorities to fully investigate these allegations, to ensure that any such persecution is ended immediately, to provide all affected persons with the assistance they require, and to ensure the safety of activists and journalists investigating the reports of abuse in Chechnya. Ireland continues to raises its concerns over the treatment of the LGBTi+ community in Russia, and especially in Chechnya, through international fora such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE. </p>  <p>  In November Ireland, along with 15 other participating States of the OSCE, invoked the Moscow Mechanism to establish a mission of experts to address the concerns surrounding allegations of impunity for reported human rights violations and abuses in Chechnya. The report, published in December, concluded that the evidence confirms the allegations of very serious human rights violations and abuses in the Chechen Republic. The invoking participating States, including Ireland, welcomed the report and its comprehensive list of specific recommendations that could be used by both Russia, including the Chechen Republic, and other participating States moving forward. We further urged Russia to heed the recommendations and work with relevant international institutions &ndash; including with the OSCE - to constructively address the issues raised. </p>  <p>  Additionally, Ireland regularly makes recommendations on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity through the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism of the UN Human Rights Council. In May 2018, as part of the UPR of the Russian Federation, Ireland recommended that Russia adopt comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation on the grounds of sexual orientation, including measures to allow LGBTi+ persons to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, without fear of harassment.</p>  <p>  The promotion and protection of human rights is a key priority of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy, as outlined in &ldquo;The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World.&rdquo; Ireland is committed to promoting the rights of LGBTI+ individuals, who continue to suffer disproportionate levels of violence and face systematic discrimination in many countries across the world.</p></reply>

He added that the EU is fully behind Ireland and has expressed, on numerous occasions, full solidarity with Ireland and that this has not changed. He made clear that the EU will continue to remind the UK of its responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement, deal or no deal. At the same time, he acknowledged that Ireland and the EU have responsibilities as regards the protection of the Single Market and Customs Union. </p>  <p>  I welcome this important clarification from the Commission,  which demonstrates that Ireland and the EU continue to be at one. It remains the case that ratifying the Withdrawal Agreement agreed between the EU and the UK Government is the best, and realistically the only, way to ensure an orderly Brexit that provides certainty with regard to the full protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including the avoidance of a hard border. </p>  <p>  The Government has consistently stated unequivocally that we will not accept a hard border on this island.  The  UK also accepts that avoiding a hard border is essential. </p>  <p>  If the UK Government cannot secure the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, while our objectives and commitments would not change, achieving and honouring them would become more difficult. So the EU and Ireland on one side, and the UK on the other, will have to work intensively together to ensure that we deliver on our shared goal of avoiding the return of a hard border, deal or no deal. We are committed to doing all in our power to ensure that goal is met.</p></reply>

"A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces regulations the award of medals for bravery is time bound. These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award. </p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of "A" Company. All representations have been considered and responded to acknowledging their valiant actions while under siege in Jadotville.   </p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: </p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006. </p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. </p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. </p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. </p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognise the brave actions of these men.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date properly honour the collective bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and full and due recognition has been afforded to them in their honour.</p></reply>

It is a significant UN peace enforcement mission comprising both regular and special operations forces and high end capabilities.  </p>  <p>  Ireland currently has no Defence Forces personnel deployed to the MINUSMA mission.  However, potential overseas missions are considered on an on-going basis.  The option to deploy a small contingent of Army Ranger Wing personnel to UN mandated MINUSMA mission as part of a larger Special Operations Forces within the mission later this year has arisen.  The Department and the Defence Forces are in the very early information gathering stage in considering this particular mission.  This involves getting detailed information on the mission and its operations, consideration of the possible role which the Defence Forces may be able to undertake in the mission, how such a deployment fits with Defence Forces capabilities having regard to existing and potential commitments at home and overseas and a detailed threat analysis and assessment.  This process has only just commenced and will take a period of time to reach a conclusion.  On foot of the respective military and policy advice arising from this process, I will then consider the matter.  </p>  <p>  I should emphasise again, that no decision has been taken yet and there is some way to go in the process before we reach that point.</p></reply>

Under this &lsquo;fast accrual&rsquo; pension scheme, maximum retirement benefits accrue after 31 years.  The 21-year pension, the rate of which varies according to retiring rank and other factors, is payable for the person&rsquo;s lifetime.</p><p>Where qualifying service is more than 21 years, an &lsquo;additional increment&rsquo; is payable at a flat rate (generally &euro;8.94 a week) for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years&rsquo; service.  This gives a maximum additional increment of &euro;89.40 weekly. However, under the &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; pension scheme rules, this additional increment ceases to be payable if and when the pensioner reaches the prescribed age for the State Pension (Contributory), that is, at age 66 to 68 depending on a person&rsquo;s date of birth.  The question of a person&rsquo;s entitlement to a State Pension is, of course, a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p><p>These arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class.  This includes NCOs and Privates who are fully insured for the range of social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, such as the State Pension (Contributory).  </p><p><i></i>Integration<i></i>means that a person&rsquo;s entitlement to social insurance benefits is taken into account when calculating the rate of their occupational pension payable. The State Pension is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual. The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries. </p><p>It might be noted that the method of integration for &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; military pensioners is more favourable than in other areas of the public service.  In the public service generally, integration begins from the time the occupational pension commences payment, for example from age 60 where &lsquo;standard accrual&rsquo; pensions apply.  However, these NCOs or Privates who serve 31 years having joined the Defence Forces at age 18/20, can qualify for maximum retirement benefits payable immediately from age 49/51.  The integration process only begins for them when the State Pension becomes payable, for example, at age 66. Furthermore, the maximum personal rate of State Pension payable (&euro;243.30 a week currently if under age 80) is considerably more than any reduction that could happen under the Defence Forces pension schemes by virtue of the loss of the additional increment on qualification for the State Pension.</p></reply>

However, a name change for a passport from that which appears on a person&rsquo;s birth certificate is permitted under the Act in situations such as marriage, civil partnership  etc. where civil, or legal documents are available to verify this change</p>  <p>  In cases where name change arises, other than by marriage or civil partnership etc, the Act requires evidence of the use of this new name over a two year period.  In very sensitive cases there is discretion under the Act for accepting evidence of usage for less than two years.</p>  <p>  Evidence of two years&rsquo; proof of usage such as bills/bank statements/official correspondence is required as a deed poll is not adequate evidence of the constant use of a new name.

We discussed the disappointing but not unexpected outcome of the 15 January vote in the House of Commons on the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement.</p>  <p>  Both Mr Barnier and I are in agreement that what we need from the UK is clarity on how it proposes to move forward, and ultimately what it wants to achieve. The EU could then consider any next steps it might take. The EU continues to take a united approach and I thanked Mr Barnier for his unwavering support for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Mr Barnier and I remain firmly of the view that the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement as endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the British Government.  The European Council in December and the joint letter from Presidents Tusk and Juncker have provided reassurances with regard to the backstop. The European Council has also made clear that the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be renegotiated and that the EU will not agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with it. The EU stands ready to work further on the Political Declaration as we look to the future relationship. </p>  <p>  In light of the ongoing uncertainty in Britain, the European Council has asked that preparedness work at the national and EU level intensify, taking account of all possible outcomes. I have outlined Ireland&rsquo;s approach in this regard to Mr Barnier, including planned legislation and other contingency measures. I also thanked Mr Barnier for the Commission&rsquo;s continued helpful and constructive engagement in this area, and their understanding of the particular challenges faced by Ireland.</p>  <p>  I also met with the British Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt.  He updated me on the British political situation and the UK Government's perspective on possible ways forward.

The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions. </p>  <p>  I visited Belfast on 9 and 10 January last and held discussions with the leaders of all of the Northern Ireland political parties. These were constructive engagements with each of the party leaders and I emphasised that the two-year absence of the devolved institutions cannot be allowed to continue. There are pressing decisions and issues across a range of areas which require a functioning Executive and Assembly. Each of the party leaders confirmed to me their wish to participate in the institutions again and provided views on key concerns and issues for their parties. </p>  <p>  Following these latest consultations, I do not underestimate the way to go in achieving a resolution, but I continue to believe that this can be achieved and that there is an increasingly urgent need for talks to begin.</p>  <p>  Both Governments are determined to find a way beyond the current impasse to get the institutions operating again and I remain in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on how this can be pursued. Secretary of State Bradley and I will meet again this week to discuss the way forward.</p>  <p>  The devolved institutions of the Agreement are urgently needed so that the mandated Assembly and power-sharing Executive can represent the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland and address issues of concern, including the challenges for Northern Ireland of the UK decision to exit the European Union. The North South Ministerial Council is also essential to oversee and develop North South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, as provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The legislation that was brought forward by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, which temporarily suspends the requirement to call an Assembly election, underlines the requirement for all with responsibilities to do everything in their power to get them operating again.</p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Secretary of State and remain in regular contact with the leaders of each of the political parties, to get the necessary political process commenced to secure an agreement for a functioning Executive and Assembly, and NSMC.</p></reply>

The Agreement consists of two elements, the Multi-Party Agreement reached between the Northern Ireland political parties and the two Governments, and an agreement between the Irish and British Governments to which the Multi-Party Agreement is annexed. The latter is referred to as the British-Irish Agreement and it is an international agreement which has been registered with the United Nations.</p>  <p>  Under the British-Irish Agreement, the two Governments affirmed their solemn commitment to support and, where appropriate, implement the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. Reflecting that solemn obligation, successive Irish and British Governments have worked together in partnership over the last 20 years - and continue to do so today - to secure the progressive implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the consolidation of peace, increasing prosperity and furthering of reconciliation across these neighbouring islands, which the Agreement has enabled.</p>  <p>  The Multi-Party Agreement provides that the two Governments can convene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to &ldquo;promote bilateral co-operation at all levels on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments&rdquo;. The Conference will keep under review the workings of the British-Irish Agreement and the machinery and institutions established thereunder. It further provides that all decisions of the Conference will be by agreement between the two Governments and that they will make determined efforts to resolve disagreements between them. Similarly, under Strand Three, the Multi-Party Agreement provides a mechanism for review where difficulties arise in relation to the institutions. Where difficulties arise which cut across the range of institutions, this review falls to the two Governments in consultation with the parties in the Assembly. </p>  <p>  The Government looks forward to the continuation of the partnership approach with the British Government as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, so as to secure the effective operation of all of the institutions and the full implementation of the Agreement.</p></reply>

Their appeal against these convictions failed at the High Court in Belfast in 2012 and, in 2015, the UK Supreme Court refused to allow them to mount a further appeal. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the case is now being looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission,  which is an independent public body responsible for reviewing possible miscarriages of justice in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.  As the case is being reviewed, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further. It is important that the legal process is respected and is allowed time to conclude. </p>  <p>  At the most recent meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Dublin last November, my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charles Flanagan T.D., and I engaged with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, David Lidington, on matters related to security co-operation.  Additionally, officials from my Department in both Dublin and Belfast monitor this case as part of their broader engagement with their Northern Irish counterparts on justice and security matters. They regularly engage with the NI Department of Justice, the Northern Ireland Office, the Northern Ireland Prison Service, the Criminal Justice Inspectorate, the NI Police Ombudsman, and the NI Prisoner Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to monitor developments in this case and the Government will take action as appropriate. It is regrettable that, due to the continuing absence of the Assembly and Executive, there is not a Northern Irish Justice Minister in place that we could engage with on these matters, but we will continue our efforts in this regard to the extent possible.</p></reply>

Our position as a member of the European Union in no way undermines or threatens this policy, a policy to which this Government remains fully committed.

We will therefore continue our efforts in this regard until we secure progress &ndash; both in terms of future legal immigration opportunities for Irish citizens; and in securing a pathway for those Irish who are undocumented in order to regularise their status. </p>  <p>  Special Envoy to the US Congress on the Undocumented, John Deasy T.D., has worked closely on these issues with my Department, and in particular with our Embassy in Washington DC.  This work will continue.  </p>  <p>  Providing on-going support for those Irish who are undocumented in the US is a priority. My Department, including through our Embassy and Consulates in the US, will continue to work with Irish Immigration Centres across the US, including supporting their outreach to vulnerable Irish and the undocumented.  In 2018, over &euro;3 million was allocated to 76 organisations across the US, including the Irish Centres. </p>  <p>  My Department maintains close ties with the US Embassy here in Dublin, and has frequent engagements and constructive discussions on a range of issues.  While I have not recently met the US Charg&eacute; d'Affaires on this issue, the Secretary General of my Department  and our Ambassador to the US have met separately with Mr. Smyth in the last two weeks. </p>  <p>  I look forward to visiting the US in February, for a series of engagements with the US Administration and Congressional leaders on the full range of issues of mutual interest. I will raise immigration issues in these meetings, as I have done in all my interactions with the US Administration and US political leaders since taking office. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Taoiseach will have a range of engagements at the highest levels of the US Administration and Congress over the St. Patrick's Day period, and will highlight our priorities in terms of immigration in that context.</p></reply>

Both Mr Barnier and I are in agreement that what we need from the UK is clarity on how it proposes to move forward, and ultimately what it wants to achieve. The EU could then consider any next steps it might take.  The EU continues to take a united approach and I thanked Mr Barnier for his unwavering support for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Mr Barnier and I remain firmly of the view that the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement as endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the British Government.  The European Council in December and the joint letter from Presidents Tusk and Juncker have provided reassurances with regard to the backstop.  The European Council has also made clear that the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be renegotiated and that the EU will not agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with it.  The EU stands ready to work further on the Political Declaration as we look to the future relationship. </p>  <p>  I welcomed Mr Barnier&rsquo;s statement to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 16 January, in which he publicly reaffirmed his commitment to the backstop and to the Withdrawal Agreement as a whole, which represents the best possible compromise between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  In our discussion, Mr Barnier and I agreed that it is the only agreement on the table that provides the essential legal guarantee to avoid a hard border in any circumstances and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.</p>  <p>  As Mr Barnier stated in Strasbourg, an orderly Brexit remains our top priority, but we must be prepared for all scenarios.  In light of the ongoing uncertainty in Britain, the European Council has asked that preparedness work at the national and EU level intensify, taking account of all possible outcomes.  I have outlined Ireland&rsquo;s approach in this regard to Mr Barnier, including planned legislation and other contingency measures. I also thanked Mr Barnier for the Commission&rsquo;s continued helpful and constructive engagement in this area, and their understanding of the particular challenges faced by Ireland.</p></reply>

The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.  </p>  <p>  These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  I am engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from my Department.   </p>  <p>  I met with Justice for the Forgotten in April last year to hear their views and update them on the Government&rsquo;s continuing engagement on legacy issues, including with the British Government on the D&aacute;il motions.  In addition, officials from my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality met with Justice for the Forgotten in July to hear their views on the implementation of the legacy framework provided for under the Stormont House Agreement.  </p>  <p>  My Department also facilitated an engagement in Dublin on 29 August last for the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Victims and Survivors, Judith Thompson, to hear the views of victims and survivors in this jurisdiction, including the families affected by the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and other attacks. </p>  <p>  In relation to the D&aacute;il motions, I have consistently underlined to the British Government that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin and Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and I have emphasised the urgent need for such a response.  </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on this request, and pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House.</p></reply>

An integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement is the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland which also contains the backstop provisions.

It also includes commitments to ensure no diminution of rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity as set out in the Good Friday Agreement and confirms that people in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy their rights as EU citizens. The Protocol also makes clear that these arrangements fully respect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent under the Good Friday Agreement. All of this is aimed at ensuring that the impact of Brexit on the everyday lives of people, both North and South, is minimised and that the status-quo on the island is protected. </p>  <p>  The negotiations have been difficult and long, with flexibility and compromise shown on both sides.

Protecting these gains is not just about ensuring frictionless trade; it is also about facilitating peoples&rsquo; lives and livelihoods. Fundamentally, this is about peace, reconciliation and prosperity. </p>  <p>  Protecting the all-island economy has been a major priority for the Government throughout the Brexit negotiations.  The issue was addressed in paragraph 49 of the December 2017 EU-UK Joint Report, in the context of North-South Cooperation and protection of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland within the Withdrawal Agreement protects the Good Friday Agreement and gains of the peace process in all its parts.  This includes underpinning continuing North South Cooperation and protecting the all island economy, including by maintaining the Single Electricity Market.  </p>  <p>  North South cooperation and cross-border trade has grown significantly in the years since the Good Friday Agreement, strengthening a growing prosperity which both supports and is supported by the peace process.  Underpinned by the current shared EU regulatory framework, cross-border trade at present represents the first export market for 73% of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s small and medium-sized companies.  More than 7,000 businesses trade from Northern Ireland across the island of Ireland, supporting over 165,000 jobs.</p>  <p>  Recent research has also shown a high degree of integration of the economies North and South, including in supply chains and trade in intermediary products.  This underlines the importance of securing an outcome in the Brexit negotiations that facilitates the continuation of the all-island economy as it functions today. This objective goes beyond trade and is to protect the Good Friday agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process.  Peace and prosperity are mutually reinforcing and cross-border trade is an important element in supporting jobs and building prosperity.</p>  <p>  Outreach to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economic and business sector continues, and my Department is facilitating North South relationship-building between business groups. </p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland, one of the North South Implementation Bodies, helps small businesses explore new cross-border markets, develop new products, processes and services and become investor-ready. It also offers practical cross-border business funding, information, advice and support to SMEs across the island. In addition, InterTradeIreland has also developed programmes aimed at helping SMEs to plan for Brexit.  </p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement remains the best option and the only agreement on the table that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland and protects the Good Friday Agreement. Our ambition throughout these negotiations has been to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement can continue to operate in all its parts after the UK leaves the Union, and the Government is committed that the gains and benefits of peace for people North and South, and East and West, can be protected.</p></reply>

It can provide certainty to citizens and business, North and South, as we continue our preparations for the new relationship with UK outside the EU. It puts in place a period of transition, up to December 2020, and extendable for up to one or two years, if needed, during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply to the UK.  This will allow for the negotiation of an agreement on the future relationship between the EU and the UK, which we hope will be deep and comprehensive. </p><p>At the same time, the Withdrawal Agreement, through the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, protects continuing North-South cooperation and the all-island economy while also recognising the continuation of the Common Travel Area. </p><p>It includes the backstop which provides a guarantee that there will be no hard border no matter what the outcome is to the negotiations on the future relationship, and that the existing frictionless travel and trade North South will be maintained. </p><p>Under the measures included for a backstop, should it need to be invoked, a UK-wide customs territory would apply, ensuring no tariffs or quotas, and including well established rules with regard to ensuring a level playing field. Northern Ireland would remain aligned to those rules of the Single Market that are indispensable to avoiding a hard border and protecting the all-island economy. It would provide businesses in Northern Ireland with the best of both worlds, access to the EU Single Market and the ability to trade freely with the rest of the UK. </p><p>I should be clear that the backstop acts simply as an insurance policy, which we hope will never have to be used. It remains our priority to achieve a future relationship agreement that can resolve all these issues, and obviate the need for the backstop.  We are determined to quickly work towards that best possible outcome. The Political Declaration makes clear the EU and UK&rsquo;s shared ambition to reach an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation, among other areas.</p><p>At the same time, as part of the Government's longstanding and intensive Brexit planning and contingency work, we are providing an array of supports and information measures to assist businesses in Ireland to respond and prepare themselves.  Across three Budgets, since 2016, the Government has put in place dedicated measures and schemes for the business and agri-food sector. This includes the Future Growth Loan Scheme, a &euro;300m fund to support strategic capital investment for a post Brexit environment by business, and &euro;71 million to further strengthen the agriculture sector&rsquo;s ability to become more resilient in addressing the challenges of Brexit. Capital expenditure of &euro;116bn over the coming decade under Project Ireland 2040 will also allow the State and its Agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects, while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead.</p><p>Government enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. Both Enterprise Ireland and Inter-Trade Ireland are provided grants to businesses to help them get Brexit ready. </p><p>To better inform business and the public at large, the Government has also overseen a coordinated communication and outreach campaign, <i>Getting Ireland Brexit Ready</i>, through the Brexit website, social media and public events.</p></reply>

Comprehensive figures for 2018 are not yet available, but the year saw another significant number of people around the world impacted by natural disasters, notably the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia. </p>  <p>  Climate change, together with poverty and poor environmental management, means that an increasing number of countries, in particular developing countries, are becoming increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters.</p>  <p>  The international community is providing record levels of funding, with a coordinated response that is reaching tens of millions of people affected by natural disasters. A rapid, effective response is vital, in order to address the immediate needs of affected populations, as well as ensure a return to sustainable livelihoods, including alleviating the risk of starvation.  Ireland's development programme also helps put in place sustainable food systems, so that the conditions which contribue to crises and starvation can be avoided.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian programme leads our response to global natural disasters, working with partners in the UN, EU, the International Red Cross Movement (ICRC) and Irish and international NGOS. </p>  <p>  Ireland has developed a deep partnership with the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA.  OCHA coordinates and leads coherent and effective international responses to humanitarian crises.  Amongst other funds, OCHA manages the Central Emergency Response Fund, which responds to sudden onset disasters and to under-funded crises.  Ireland is a strong supporter of both mechanisms and the current chair of the OCHA donor support group, which works with the Office of the UN Humanitarian Coordinator. In 2018 OCHA has assisted millions of people affected by natural disasters around the world, including the response to Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean, drought in Afghanistan, and floods in Nigeria.  During 2018, my Department hosted a Casement Lecture by the UN Humanitarian Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, on the theme of innovation in humanitarian financing, a contribution to the raising of awareness on new approaches to crisis response.</p>  <p>  Ireland also works closely with the ICRC and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The IFRC is the world's largest humanitarian organisation, comprising 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent member societies, and reaches 160 million people annually through 17 million volunteers, members and staff. Ireland provided &euro;1.85 million to the Federation in 2018 to support its coordination of relief operations to assist victims of natural disasters, including those affected by the earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia.</p>  <p>  Ireland's NGO partners provide rapid assistance following natural disasters. For example, in response to the eruption of the Fuego Volcano in Guatemala on 3 June 2018, Ireland provided &euro;75,000 to Plan International to assist with shelter for those affected. </p>  <p>  As well as responding quickly and effectively in the event of a disaster, it is also important to work with countries to build up their resilience to disasters. Ireland provides core support to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction worth &euro;0.5m to help them build capacity in Ireland&rsquo;s key partner countries to prepare for and manage the impact of disasters.</p></reply>

Conflict is the most significant driver of this increased need. </p>  <p>  Critical to maximising Ireland&rsquo;s response is our central and enduring commitment to effective multilateralism, particularly through our membership of the European Union and the United Nations. Ireland is a strong contributor not just to decisions regarding the international humanitarian response to crises but also, importantly, to efforts to prevent and resolve conflict.</p>  <p>  At the EU level, Ireland is engaging actively along with other EU Member States on issues relating to peace and security, and also in the oversight of EU development and humanitarian instruments. Last week&rsquo;s meeting of EU and African Union Foreign Ministers, attended by both the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of Foreign Affairs and myself, discussed peace and security cooperation - a central pillar of the EU-AU partnership. Through the European Development Fund we are contributing to the African Peace Facility, an important source of funding for the African Union's efforts in peace and security.</p>  <p>  Likewise, at the level of the UN Ireland is playing a central role in promoting multilateral engagement on peace and security and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. We are also promoting the UN&rsquo;s ability to respond effectively where crises occur. For example, Ireland is currently chairing the donor group of the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA. This agency manages the Central Emergency Response Fund, responding to sudden onset disasters and to under-funded crises. A key priority for Ireland as Chair is the protection of civilians and the upholding of international humanitarian law. </p>  <p>  In international forums, Ireland consistently advocates for adherence to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and calls on all parties &ndash; for example, those engaged in the Syria conflict - to fulfil their responsibility to protect civilians and to allow the safe passage of humanitarian assistance. </p>  <p>  Ireland also continues to support efforts by the UN in keeping peace, improving human well-being and advancing human rights and the rule of law. The UN has helped to end numerous conflicts, often through actions of the Security Council - the organ with primary responsibility, under the United Nations Charter, for the maintenance of international peace and security. </p>  <p>  Ireland has a long tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions, including in some of the world&rsquo;s most complex and intractable conflicts. Ireland has maintained a continuous presence in UN peace support operations since 1958, and the Government is committed to participation in peacekeeping operations as a tangible contribution to the development of global peace and security. This was illustrated by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s recent visit to Mali, where he met members of the Irish Defence Forces serving with the EU Training Mission to Mali (EUTM).  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to peace and security has informed our decision to seek election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the period 2021-22. If elected, membership of the Security Council will allow Ireland to play an even more important influential role in the international response to the needs of the most vulnerable.</p></reply>

I remain deeply concerned by the threat to peace and security represented by armed groups such as Boko Haram and Al Shabaab.  The Government consistently condemns their brutal attacks on civilian populations, and particularly the impact of such violence on women and girls.   </p>  <p>  Ireland is working with partners to implement a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of radicalisation in both regions. The EU is engaged through political dialogue, EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions (including EUCAP Somalia, EUNAVFOR Operation Atalanta and EUTM Somalia), and development and humanitarian cooperation. The Irish Defence Forces and other Irish experts have participated in many different CSDP Missions, often at a senior level - the former Director of the Irish Coast Guard will deploy to Mogadishu to take up the position of Deputy Head of Mission at EUCAP Somalia at the end of this month.  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these CSDP Missions allows us to contribute to international peace and security, to protect human rights, and to support conditions for sustainable development.  </p>  <p>  The EU is also actively supporting capacity building operations in the areas of maritime law enforcement and training, while in territories affected by Boko Haram, the EU has pledged &euro;50 million in support of the Multinational Joint Taskforce which promotes regional security.   The EU provides considerable support to the UN-mandated AMISOM, the African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia, to combat the serious threat posed by Al-Shabaab.  Through a wide variety of programmes and partnerships, the EU also supports the strengthening of Somalia&rsquo;s Government institutions. </p>  <p>  Ireland works bilaterally, as an EU Member State, and with UN partners to promote peace and security in areas affected by armed groups.  The Embassies of Ireland in Nairobi and Abuja actively monitor the situation on the ground, advise on humanitarian response and guide Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in EU and UN forums. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland works with partners on our collective humanitarian response. In 2018, Ireland provided &euro;5.5 million in humanitarian support to the Somalia and &euro;4.8 million to the Lake Chad region. As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support through the multilateral system and via the EU. The European Union last year provided almost &euro;89 million to Somalia and &euro;90 million to the Lake Chad region. Ireland is the 7th largest donor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which last year allocated &euro;15 million to Somalia and &euro;43 million to the Lake Chad region. With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute throughout 2019, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.</p></reply>

In the Council Conclusions on Enlargement which were agreed on Tuesday 26 June 2018, the EU reaffirmed its commitment to enlargement and stated that it continues to represent a strategic investment in peace, democracy, prosperity, security and stability in Europe. The Conclusions also stated that the EU is determined to strengthen and intensify its engagement at all levels to support the region's political, economic and social transformation, including through increased assistance, based on tangible progress on the rule of law, as well as on socio-economic reforms, by the countries in the region.</p>  <p>  There is a recognition that this is not only a strategic investment in Europe's security and prosperity, but that it can also contribute greatly to the long term stability of formerly war-torn areas in that it helps create a political environment conducive to bilateral issues being resolved, as we have witnessed recently in the agreement between Athens and Skopje on the name issue. </p>  <p>  As a demonstration of the EU&rsquo;s commitment, the European Commission adopted in 2018 a strategy for &lsquo;A credible enlargement perspective for and enhanced EU engagement with the Western Balkans&rsquo;. In this Strategy, the Commission sets out clearly the actions that it will implement in the short to medium term to boost transformation efforts in the region in areas of mutual interest. These actions are set out across six flagship initiatives: strengthening the rule of law, reinforcing cooperation on security and migration and expanding the EU Energy Union into the Western Balkans, lowering roaming charges and rolling out broadband in the region. In addition, the Strategy underlines the need for the EU to be prepared to welcome new members on the condition they have met the rigorous criteria for doing so.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Commission proposal for the new Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance fund (IPA III) for the 2021-2027 period, envisages a 13% increase (to &euro;14.5 billion) compared to current funding, and also seeks to make this fund more strategic by clearly anchoring it in the context of the Western Balkans Strategy.</p>  <p>  Over the longer-term, there is a recognition in the EU that enlargement is a geostrategic investment in a stable, strong and united Europe based on common values. A credible accession perspective is the key driver of transformation in the region as it enhances our collective integration, security, prosperity and social well-being.</p></reply>

However, the Ethiopian reform process is complicated by a backdrop of ethnic conflict and high levels of internal displacement.  More positively, Prime Minister Abiy led the process leading to an historic rapprochement between Ethiopia and Eritrea in July 2018, after decades of conflict.</p>  <p>  In South Sudan, President Salva Kiir signed a new peace agreement with a number of opposition groups in September 2018. </p>  <p>  Widespread protests erupted in Sudan in December, initially against the worsening economic situation but which have since developed into calls for President Omar al-Bashir&rsquo;s resignation. </p>  <p>  Al Shabaab have claimed responsibility for a recent terrorist attack in Nairobi in which 21 people were killed. </p>  <p>  There have been a number of worrying developments in Somalia, including attacks on the UN Compound in Mogadishu and expulsion of the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General for Somalia in January. </p>  <p>  The region is also affected by the challenges of irregular migration, forced displacement, trafficking in human beings, and smuggling of people.  Taken together, the political trajectory of the region when combined with climatic shocks, severe drought, and conflict, has escalated the scale of the humanitarian crisis in the region, with more than 24 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.  </p>  <p>  Ireland, together with its UN and EU partners, is strongly committed to and actively engaged in the Horn of Africa, through our political, development and humanitarian efforts.  The EU engages in the region through political dialogue, its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions (EU NAVFOR Operation Atalanta, EUCAP Somalia, and EUTM Somalia), and development and humanitarian cooperation.  The former Director of the Irish Coast Guard will deploy to Mogadishu to take up the position of Deputy Head of Mission at EUCAP Somalia at the end of this month.  Ireland, through the EU, also supports the efforts of the UN peacekeeping mission AMISOM to stabilise Somalia.  Through regional and bilateral programmes and the Trust Fund for Africa, the EU is providing over &euro;3 billion to the Horn of Africa (2014-2020).  Ireland has pledged &euro;15 million to the Trust Fund for Africa.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports regional efforts in the Horn of Africa to achieve stability, normalise relations and increase regional cooperation, including through regional organisations such as the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).  During his visit to Ethiopia in January 2019, the Taoiseach met with the acting Chairperson of the African Union, to discuss regional issues.  During his visit to Ethiopia and Kenya in November 2017, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD and the African Union, and Ireland has since provided funding to IGAD to support negotiation, monitoring and evaluation of the South Sudan peace agreement and is planning to further increase engagement with the African Union in 2019.  In addition, two Departmental officials are seconded to the EU mission in South Sudan.</p>  <p>  The EU has a Special Representative to the Horn of Africa, Alex Rondos, whose mandate is to contribute to regional and international efforts to achieve lasting peace, security and development in the region.  The T&aacute;naiste discussed EU efforts in the region with EUSR Rondos when he visited Dublin in November 2018.</p>  <p>  In response to the multiple humanitarian crises in the region, Ireland has provided &euro;164 million in direct humanitarian assistance to the Horn of Africa since 2012.  Over &euro;30 million in Irish funding was provided in 2018, including to UN agencies and Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable.  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute throughout 2019, Ireland remains committed to providing humanitarian assistance where it is needed most in the Horn of Africa, working with partners who can ensure that such assistance is delivered in a coordinated and effective manner.</p></reply>

Tens of thousands of children are recruited and used as soldiers in conflicts around the world.  Since 2002, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has issued an annual report on children and armed conflict which lists all armed groups &ndash; both state and non-state &ndash; that recruit and use children.  The most recent report, published in May 2018, indicated that children continue to be disproportionately affected by armed conflict in many country situations.  The report also noted that in 2017, there was a large increase in the number of violations compared with the number reported for 2016.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and use of children as soldiers is explicitly prohibited under international humanitarian law and human rights law.  In 1999, the UN Security Council passed its first Resolution, UNSCR 1261, on the impact of armed conflict on children and condemned violations in that context. In the same year, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child entered into force.  Article 22 of the Charter sets out a prohibition on the recruitment and direct participation in hostilities of any person under the age of 18 years.</p>  <p>  Ever since, the Security Council has established important tools to strengthen child protection and to strengthen implementation of international standards, including the position of UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict who investigates and develops best practices to address the recruitment and use of child soldiers. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to the eradication of the recruitment and use of child soldiers.  In addition to the focus in our development programmes on addressing the socio-economic causes which can lead to conflict, and the recruitment of child soldiers, Ireland also supports more targeted interventions by working with organizations such as UNICEF, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and institutions such as the International Criminal Court.</p></reply>

I was also delighted to welcome President Abbas to Ireland in September, his first visit in ten years, during which he also had good meetings with the President and the Taoiseach.  These visits and meetings have allowed me to raise Ireland's priorities with pivotal decision makers, and have helped to inform my thinking on how best to support efforts to advance the broader peace process.</p>  <p>  At present, prospects for the resumption of negotiations centre on the peace plan being developed by the United States.  I have engaged with the US Middle East team to encourage this initiative, and to highlight some of the key issues which it will have to address, if it is to be successful.  I have encouraged my EU colleagues to take a similar approach. </p>  <p>  Regrettably however, the US administration has made a series of unilateral actions over the past year that have made bringing all interlocutors together for negotiations more difficult.  Efforts towards peace are more likely to succeed, when attention is paid to creating the right political context for fruitful cooperation.  I have conveyed this view to both US and Israeli interlocutors.</p>  <p>  I have spent much time considering how the EU and the wider international community can productively engage and better use the resources at our disposal to influence the parties to the conflict.  In December, Ireland proposed a Resolution at the UN General Assembly on a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.  This resolution, which reaffirmed the long-standing and broadly agreed parameters for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was adopted by an overwhelming majority of 156 UN states, including common EU support.</p>  <p>  I am also convening a small gathering of Foreign Ministers in Dublin in February, to discuss the Middle East Peace Process.

Embassies and Consulates around the world provide vital support for Ireland&rsquo;s state enterprise agencies, including by supporting their strategic objectives and activities in overseas markets.  The role of the Embassy in supporting Ireland&rsquo;s trade objectives is particularly pertinent in markets with limited or no state agency presence. </p><p>Officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade across the Embassy network continuously engage in economic and public diplomacy, to advance Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity and raise awareness of Ireland as a great place to live, study, work, visit and do business.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s officers overseas engage with host country Governments and multilateral institutions on a range of trade-related issues, including market access, regulatory compliance, visas, phyto-sanitary issues, and Double Taxation Agreements.</p><p>The Embassy network also supports Irish businesses in market, by providing contacts and information, organising Ministerial visits overseas and supporting trade missions, in partnership with the state agencies.</p><p>In June 2018, the Government launched the Global Ireland<i></i>initiative, which<i></i>aims to double the impact and scope of Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint by 2025. Global Ireland's targets include enhanced global engagement, the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy network and strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s state agency presence overseas.  Each of these measures will increase Ireland&rsquo;s international visibility, facilitate market diversification and intensification, and deepen bilateral relations in support of the Government&rsquo;s economic and political objectives, including in the context of Brexit.</p><p>To date, the Government has approved funding for 13 new Embassies and Consulates, which are either already open, or set to open during 2019 or 2020.  As part of Global Ireland, in 2018 a new Embassy was opened in Wellington and a new Consulate General was opened in Vancouver.  New Embassies will open in Bogot&aacute;, Santiago de Chile and Amman in 2019, and new Consulates General will open in Mumbai, Cardiff, Frankfurt and LA.  In 2020, new Embassies will open in Kyiv, Manila and Rabat.

The Report states that some of these models are quite complex and should to be considered in a wider context.  As well as impacting upon insurance premiums, they may impact on taxation and social security and must be considered in terms of existing constitutional, national and European requirements, e.g. the requirements of EU Motor Insurance Directives in terms of an individual&rsquo;s right to monetary compensation.</p><p>The Motor Report recommended that a Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) be established with a view to proposing further measures that can help reduce the cost of claims.  Amongst other issues, the PIC was charged with analysing and reporting on alternative compensation and resolution models internationally, focusing on common law systems while taking account of social welfare, healthcare and related factors associated with each jurisdictions.  </p><p>The second report of the PIC, under the chairmanship of former President of the High Court Justice Nicholas Kearns, was published in September 2018 and Chapter 3 includes the results of its examination of the various compensation and resolution models used in around a dozen different countries, including, in section 3.5, New Zealand.  The report is available at: <i></i></p><p>The PIC concluded that it would be difficult to envisage a no-fault system such as exists in New Zealand being applied in Ireland in view of our current legal and constitutional framework.  The PIC considers that there may be a European level legislative dimension to this matter with such models only operating in jurisdictions outside the continent.  The PIC also notes that introducing a no-fault system model would have fundamental cost implications in terms of raising revenue in the form of direct and indirect taxation. </p><p>At a broader level, I would be cautious about the introduction of a State-backed insurance scheme in this jurisdiction generally for a number of other reasons.  Such an approach could actually decrease competition in the Irish insurance market, with insurers potentially deciding to cease insuring certain types of risks if there is a view that the State will insure these risks instead, particularly lines of business which are considered to be unprofitable.  This would lead to a lack of choice for those seeking cover which could ultimately mean that the cost of insurance becomes even more expensive than it is now.  Also, there is no reason to believe that the State would be any better at managing risks than private insurance companies, and as a result there potentially would be a large financial exposure to the State if significant losses were incurred.  Finally, any State insurance scheme would be required to comply with the same prudential rules as private companies, thereby meaning that the cost of any insurance would still have to reflect the risk involved.  </p><p>In view of these factors, I am not convinced that a State-backed motor insurance scheme would be a panacea with regard to the cost or availability of insurance, either for younger drivers or other categories of consumers.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-29a.298.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900064#WRG03400"><p>Solid fuel carbon tax commenced in May 2013 and the current rates per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted are &euro;52.67, &euro;36.67, &euro;17.99 and &euro;27.99 respectively for coal, peat briquettes, milled peat and other peat.  Annual net receipts for solid fuel carbon tax amounted to &euro;25.3 million in 2018.  Approximately 75% of solid fuel carbon tax yield relates to coal.</p>  <p>  Revenue has responsibility for administering this tax and, as it does with all taxes and duties, takes a risk-focused approach in its deployment of resources on compliance activities.  Solid fuel carbon tax is collected by Revenue on a self-assessment basis and compliance with the law is enforced using the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes. </p>  <p>  Liable fuel suppliers must file a return and pay for each bi-monthly period by the last day of the following month.  Where suppliers do not submit returns by the due date Revenue will issue an estimate of the tax due.  The estimate is the amount of tax that Revenue will pursue if a supplier does not complete and file their return.  If a taxpayer fails to pay the amount due, including any debt for which an estimate has issued, Revenue may refer the debt for enforcement action.  This can include sheriff enforcement, civil proceedings through the courts or attachment of third parties.  I am advised that, as of November 2018, Revenue has undertaken actions, including sheriff enforcement, civil proceedings through the courts or attachment of third parties, to enforce approximately &euro;640,000 of solid fuel carbon tax.  </p>  <p>  Currently, there is no carbon tax on domestic solid fuel in Northern Ireland.  This factor, combined with that jurisdiction's lower VAT rate on solid fuel and currency fluctuations, can give rise to significant price differentials for solid fuel between this State and Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of solid fuel carbon tax.  Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel.  Similarly, the transport or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue's officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession. </p>  <p>  As I, and my predecessor, have pointed out before, the collection of solid fuel carbon tax is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State.  This regulatory regime imposes higher environmental standards on coal in the State than applies in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities who have powers to inspect premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel, collect samples of coal to check for adherence to environmental standards and to prosecute traders involved in selling illicit coal.  The Regulations also provide for the establishment of a register of coal suppliers by the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue is in contact at present with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel and to explore how Revenue could support the Department to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that solid fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here.  I understand that contacts are ongoing with a view to undertaking a number of joint operations and to explore the scope for follow up action by Revenue in relation to persons found to be in breach of environmental regulations.</p></reply>

I am satisfied that combatting such activity and criminality has been and continues to be a priority for Revenue.</p><p>Steps taken by Revenue to combat the illegal fuel trade include the introduction of stringent supply chain controls and reporting requirements, and a rigorous programme of enforcement action.  In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, from April 2015.</p><p>The industry view is that the action taken has been successful in curtailing fuel fraud.  I am advised also that Revenue conducted random National Sampling Programmes in 2016 and 2017 to assess the extent of fuel laundering.  The programmes each involved nearly one in ten of some 2,500 holders of auto fuel trader licences, and tests of diesel samples taken from the randomly selected traders found no evidence of the new marker in any of them.  The results of this sampling are a clear indication that Revenue&rsquo;s actions have resulted in the near elimination of the selling of laundered products at retail level.  The 2018 sampling programme was expanded to include hauliers and other businesses in the transport sector.  A very small number of samples from this programme tested positive, and another sampling programme will take place this year.</p><p>Illicit trade in alcohol can occur through the diversion of untaxed alcohol on to the market, through the production of counterfeit alcohol and through smuggling from countries with lower taxes.  While there has been little evidence of large-scale illegal activity, as indicated by the low value of seizures in 2017 (&euro;0.91million) when set against the overall value of the alcohol market (&euro;6.1billion), I am assured that Revenue remains vigilant and takes appropriate action where illicit activity is detected.  This action is informed by,<i>inter alia</i>, intelligence on criminal activity and risk-based examination of commercial traffic and stock in retail premises.  Key results of this activity include the seizure of almost 200,000 litres of beer, believed to be associated with diversion fraud, since September 2017; the uncovering in November 2017 of a large-scale counterfeit vodka production plant processing highly dangerous denatured industrial alcohol and the detention in June 2018 at Dublin Port of a container carrying a quantity of raw alcohol with the capacity to produce over 50,000 litres of illicit alcohol.  On 16 January 2019, officers at Dublin Port seized over 11,000 litres of alcohol with a retail value of over &euro;403,000.  The smuggled alcohol, which included over 10,200 litres of blended Scotch whiskey and 800 litres of alcopops, represents a potential loss to the exchequer of over &euro;255,000.</p><p>Revenue acts against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade, so that the illicit products involved can be seized and those responsible for smuggling or supplying them can be prosecuted.  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence, and the risk-based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages is used to intercept illicit products.  Action after importation includes checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  This action has delivered considerable success, with the seizure in 2018 of almost 68 million cigarettes and approximately 1,900 kilograms of tobacco.  In March 2018, a joint operation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na led to the closing down of a major illicit cigarette factory in Jenkinstown, County Louth.  Over 20 million cigarettes and 70 tonnes of tobacco were seized at this facility, which could produce 250,000 illicit cigarettes an hour.  At the end of October last, Revenue seized 7.2 million cigarettes that arrived into Dublin Port from Rotterdam.  At the end of last November, Revenue seized over 8 million smuggled cigarettes that arrived into Dublin Port from Rotterdam.</p><p>I know that Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against fuel, alcohol and tobacco crime, and also cooperate closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, in the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force.  I am advised that this cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups responsible for much of this criminality, who operate across jurisdictions.</p><p>I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit alcohol and tobacco trades has delivered significant results.  Revenue is, however, conscious of the resourcefulness of those involved in these forms of criminal activity and is vigilant for, and ready to respond to, any new developments in these areas.

However, a Revenue Commissioners concession allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain types of vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  Revenue has since decided to remove this concession with effect from 1 March 2019 so that all food supplements will be charged at the standard VAT rate.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that human oral medicines, including certain folic acid and other vitamin and mineral products, licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Association will continue to apply at the zero rate of VAT.  Infant foods will also continue to be zero rated. </p>  <p>  The operation of the concession became extremely problematic as a result of efforts by certain businesses in the industry to extend the concession beyond the scope permitted.  Consistent challenges to Revenue guidance and decisions on the VAT rating of products gave rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p>  <p>  However, independent of Revenue&rsquo;s decisions on interpretation, I agreed during the recent Finance Bill to put in place a process that will conclude in the 2019 Tax Strategy Group Paper to examine some of the policy choices around the VAT treatment of food supplements.</p></reply>

The exemption of fish supplied by fishermen to taxable persons, including buyers from outside Ireland, regardless of turnover threshold.</p>  <p>  2. The treatment of supplies of zero-rated food products as supplies of a service when catered, resulting in the application of the 13.5% VAT rate.</p>  <p>  3. In the case of goods made by a contractor from materials supplied by the customer, if the materials are taxable at a lower rate than the service rate applicable, this derogation allows for the value of the materials to be taxed at a rate equal to the difference between the higher and lower rates. </p>  <p>  4. Relief from VAT to foreign taxable persons in receipt of taxable Irish services, subject to the foreign trader being registered for VAT or proving economic status.</p>  <p>  5. Simplification arrangement for retailers, who can calculate their tax liability with reference to cash receipts rather than invoices issued. </p>  <p>  6. A refund to non-registered farmers of the VAT charged on certain buildings and the drainage or clearing of land.</p>  <p>  7, The application of zero-rating to fertilizers, animal feeding stuffs and seeds.</p>  <p>  8. The two-thirds rule, which provides that a service which is normally taxable at the reduced rate, will be taxable at the rate applying to any goods provided in the course of providing that service, in certain circumstances.</p>  <p>  Ireland also enjoys other derogations from the general VAT rules, as provided for under the VAT Directive.  Articles 109 to 122 provide for the entitlement to apply the zero rate or a reduced rate of VAT to certain supplies of goods or services, where such rate was applied in a Member State prior to 1 January 1991. Ireland uses this derogation to continue to apply the zero rate to such supplies as printed books, human or oral medicines, food and children&rsquo;s clothes and to apply a reduced rate to such supplies as construction services, domestic fuels, general repair and maintenance services and residential housing.  The full list of goods and services operating under derogated VAT rate treatment in Ireland is contained in Part 2 of Schedule 2, and Part 2B, Part 3 and Part 4 of Schedule 3 to the VAT Consolidation Act 2010.</p>  <p>  Historical VAT rate derogation is also operated by Ireland to certain services in accordance with Article 371 of the VAT Directive, which allows the continuation of VAT exemption where those services were exempt in a Member State as at 1 January 1978.  The supply of passenger transport, public water services and admissions to sporting events are exempt from VAT under this derogation. </p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland also avails of a derogation, as provided for under Article 17 of the VAT Directive, to restrict the right to deduct VAT in respect of expenditure on passenger cars, petrol, entertainment, accommodation and food or drink.</p></reply>

In addition, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions on certain goods and services not provided for in Annex III.  Ireland has retained the application of the reduced rate of VAT, 13.5%, to the supply of fuel, gas, oil and electricity services for domestic use, and, under the Directive, the rate applicable to such services cannot be reduced below 12%.  It is not possible, therefore, to apply a 0% rate to household utilities. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that VAT returns do not identify specific transactions or activities and therefore it is not possible to estimate the cost of reducing the VAT rate on these specific services.</p></reply>

The penalty regime provided for in this section applies to all tax defaults. In summary, the regime applies a penalty commencing at 100% of the additional tax due, but reduced by a number of factors including: </p><p>- The behaviour of the taxpayer that gave rise to the default, i.e. whether it was Deliberate Behaviour, Careless Behaviour with Significant Consequences or Careless Behaviour without Significant Consequences.</p><p>- Whether a Qualifying Disclosure, prompted or unprompted, was made.</p><p>- Whether the taxpayer co-operated with Revenue.</p><p>Full details on penalties are set out in Chapter 5 of the Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and other Compliance Interventions. This can be found on the Revenue website at the following link: </p><p><i></i>.</p><p>It should be noted that where a penalty cannot be agreed with the taxpayer, Revenue advise me that they will ask the relevant Court to determine the penalty.</p><p>Revenue also advise me that without the full facts of any case, it is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the level of penalty due. I am advised, however, that it is very much in the taxpayer&rsquo;s interest to advise Revenue of a default, whether intentional or unintentional, in advance of the start of any form of intervention, as the taxpayer can benefit from reduced penalties and avoid being investigated with a view to a prosecution. Full details of options for a taxpayer to regularise their tax affairs are set out in Chapter 3 of the Code of Practice. The relevant options for the EII scheme include: </p><p>1. Declaring an Innocent Error</p><p>An innocent error may be corrected without penalty where the tax default was not deliberate and the taxpayer took reasonable care to comply with their tax obligations. A number of factors will be considered when deciding if a tax default will be accepted as an innocent error and they are set out in paragraph 3.3 of the Code. </p><p>2. Self-Correction</p><p>To encourage taxpayers to self-review and regularise any errors or oversights, the Code allows taxpayers to self-correct without penalty for a defined period. For the EII scheme, this period ends with the filing of the Corporation Tax return for the period in which the Statement of Qualification was issued or until the taxpayer is notified of a compliance intervention, whichever occurs earlier. </p><p>3. Qualifying Unprompted Disclosure</p><p>Taxpayers can make an unprompted qualifying disclosure before Revenue initiates an investigation or inquiry or before the issue of a letter notifying the taxpayer of the commencement of an audit. The benefits of making a qualifying unprompted disclosure include significantly reduced tax-geared penalties and that the taxpayer will not be investigated with a view to prosecution, nor will they be published for the defaults disclosed. </p><p>4. Qualifying Prompted Disclosure </p><p>Taxpayers also have the benefit of making a prompted qualifying disclosure in the period between the date of issue of the audit notification letter and the actual start of the audit. The benefits of making a qualifying prompted disclosure include reduced tax-geared penalties and that the taxpayer will not be investigated with a view to prosecution, nor will they be published for the defaults disclosed.</p></reply>

Additionally, the new Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, provides that the holder of the legal title to credit, if not already subject to authorisation by the Central Bank, must now be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm.  </p>  <p>  This Central Bank regulatory framework makes clear that the relevant Central Bank statutory codes, such as the Consumer Protection Code and where applicable the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, will apply to residential mortgages provided to consumers irrespective of the current creditor party to that mortgage agreement. In this context there are a number of regulatory obligations which are due to the consumer. Firstly, there is an obligation to ensure that the "owner" of the mortgage acts honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interest of its customers.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, an addendum to the Consumer Protection Code which came into effect from 1 February 2017, now requires that a regulated entity (including where applicable a credit servicing firm) must produce a summary statement of its policy for setting each variable mortgage interest rate (excluding a tracker interest rate) which, inter alia,  </p>  <p>  (I) clearly identifies the factors which may result in changes to the variable interest rate;</p>  <p>  (II) clearly outlines the criteria and procedures applicable to the setting of the variable interest rate and </p>  <p>  (III) clearly outlines where the regulated entity applies a different approach to setting the variable interest rate for different cohorts of borrowers and the reasons for the different approach.  </p>  <p>   There is also a requirement to update this statement when the policy changes. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, a regulated entity is also obliged, at least annually, to provide to a variable mortgage interest rate borrower (excluding a tracker interest rate mortgage), inter alia, a summary of other mortgage products offered by the entity which could provide savings for the personal consumer at that point in time and details of how the personal consumer can obtain information on these mortgage products. (There is also a requirement to provide a link to the relevant section of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's website relating to switching lenders or changing mortgage type. The most recent addendum to the Consumer Protection Codes, which came into effect on 1 January 2019, further supports the mortgage switching process and, where applicable, also requires lenders to notify borrowers if savings can be made on the mortgage by moving between loan to value interest rate bands.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-29a.335.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900065#WRH01400"><p>As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing or provision of insurance products.  Indeed, the EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks.  These are considered by insurance companies on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>Motor insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.  Factors include those such as the age and type of vehicle, the age of the driver, the relevant driving experience, the claims record, how the vehicle is used, and the number of drivers.  Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, prices vary across the market and consumers are free to choose.  Insurance companies also price in accordance with their own past claims experience. </p><p>Notwithstanding the above, my predecessor as Minister for Finance, Mr. Michael Noonan T.D., established the Cost of Insurance Working Group in July 2016.  This Working Group, now chaired by the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Mr. Michael D&rsquo;Arcy T.D., undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers and businesses.</p><p>The initial focus of the Working Group was the issue of rising motor insurance premiums and the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  </p><p>Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress.  The seventh such update was published last November and shows that of the 59 separate applicable deadlines within the Action Plan set to the end of Q3 2018, 45 relate to actions which have now been completed.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;. </p><p>Both the Report and the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within &ldquo;The Cost of Insurance Working Group&rdquo; sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.  </p><p>It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and a more stable and competitive insurance market.  In this regard, it should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for December 2018) indicates that private motor insurance premiums have decreased by 22.16% since peaking in July 2016.  While it is accepted that premiums are still at a very high level for many people, such statistics indicate at least a greater degree of stability in the market on an overall basis.</p><p>Finally, it may be of interest to your constituent that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website &ndash; <i></i>&ndash; has an informative section regarding the purchase of car insurance, and one of the key tips listed to help cut costs is to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; and &ldquo;always get quotes from several insurance providers when you need to get or renew insurance&rdquo;.</p></reply>

At the outset, it is important to note that my Department does not collect the type of information being sought by the Deputy and therefore I am not in a position to answer any specific questions regarding insurance compensation after Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I understand that the Minister of State requested Department officials to carry out an analysis with regard to how insurance claims were managed in the wake of Storms Ophelia and Emma last year.  This arose on foot of negative feedback the Minister of State had received personally from policyholders of delays in claims processing in relation to the storms.</p>  <p>  As part of this review, the Minister of State and Department officials met directly with a number of the largest insurance companies operating in the State to discuss their individual responses as well as to seek information with regard to how the claims process was handled since the storms, highlighting the issues that the Minister of State had received feedback on.  Meetings also took place with representatives of loss assessors and a number of insurance brokers from an area which was heavily impacted by Storm Emma.  A summary was prepared following these meetings outlining an analysis of some of the points raised during the meetings.  This was presented to the Minister of State for his consideration and in response he has asked that his concerns be further examined by members of the CIWG over the coming weeks.   </p>  <p>  Finally you should note that there are no proposals at present to introduce legislation on the points raised in the question.</p></reply>

This policy addresses all aspects of deer welfare and management of the deer herd in line with international best practice. The Phoenix Park team has long-standing experience in managing the herd of wild fallow deer at the Park.</p>  <p>  Together with the School of Biology &amp;amp; Environmental Science at U.C.D., OPW has explored various approaches to population management appropriate to a wild herd including use of contraceptives and relocation of deer to other locations. These options are impractical for a number of reasons primarily because the deer are wild and there are very significant physical challenges in dealing with wild adult deer. For example, capture and transport would be extremely stressful for the animal and so, for animal welfare reasons, relocation is not considered appropriate.</p>  <p>  Having considered the various options in detail and with reference to international best practice for management of wild herds, OPW has concluded that a cull, as undertaken on 9 January, is considered the most appropriate and humane approach to population management.</p></reply>

However, given the scale of the necessary increase in public capital investment, against the backdrop of continuing strong private sector investment, the mid-term review of the 2016-2021 Capital Plan published by DPER in September 2017 noted the potential for capacity pressures in the construction sector and the need for a strategic focus on addressing these. </p>  <p>  As announced in the NDP in February 2018, a Construction Sector Group has been established to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector. The CSG is made up of each of the key segments of the industry along with officials from relevant Departments and Agencies.  The CSG's remit includes the consideration of opportunities to introduce reforms within the sector that will help in controlling price inflation, improving efficiency and delivering value for money investment. </p>  <p>  In particular there will be strong focus on developing initiatives to drive productivity growth in the construction sector. This will help ensure a higher level of output for a given level of resources and can assist in tempering the impact of inflation caused by capacity constraints. </p>  <p>  My Department is preparing a report on the performance and prospects of the Irish construction sector based on the available data. That report, which I anticipate will be published in the coming weeks, will further aid in the monitoring of trends across the sector, ranging from output and investment to employment and cost inflation, so that risks and performance issues can be identified and addressed where necessary.</p></reply>

The principle of pay parity underlies this pension increase policy. This means that the pay increases agreed as part of the PSSA, and legislated for in the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, are passed on to pension recipients to bring the salary on which their pension is based up to the current salary rate of those still serving, after the pay increases have been applied to serving staff. Pension recipients qualify to receive an increase if the salary on which their pension is based is lower than the current salary rate of those still serving in the same grade and on the same scale point.</p><p>Because current salary rates for serving staff are being progressively restored to the pre-FEMPI cut levels, it means that for increasing numbers of pension recipients, the salary on which their pension is based will be overtaken by the current salary rates for serving staff, with the result that these pension recipients will qualify for pension increases.</p><p>In addition to the grant of pension increases as I have described, pension recipients will also benefit from the reduction/elimination of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) in accordance with the FEMPI Act 2015<i></i>and the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017.

In May 2014 the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board recommended this approach and secured a derogation.

All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the 100Mbps programme. </p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints. Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided. </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy is in the National Broadband Plan intervention area and is currently on a 12 Mbp/s wireless connection through the Schools Broadband Access Programme. The school is in year three of a three year service agreement. When this contract has expired towards the end of 2019 the school will be retendered to the Departments' framework of suppliers, and upgraded to a higher speed if possible.</p>  <p>  Under the current primary schools programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. A recent drawdown from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,400 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan). Those schools have now been upgraded to that connectivity. This represents more than one third of all primary schools. This is a significant improvement over recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012. Further schools are likely to be upgraded to those speeds in 2019, through EIR's 300K Rural Deployment commitment.</p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and as noted access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan. An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision.</p></reply>

The report is expected shortly.</p><p>The NCSE is continuing to work with schools, parents, NEPS, health professionals and other staff who are involved in the provision of services in the North Dublin area for children with special educational needs, to ensure that each child has a school placement appropriate to their needs for the 2018/19 school year and beyond.</p><p>Funding for special education provision in 2018 will amount to some &euro;1.75 billion, up 43% since 2011 and equivalent to 18.7% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training.</p><p>My Department's policy is to provide for the inclusive education of children with special educational needs, including Autism (ASD), in mainstream school settings, unless such a placement would not be in the best interests of the child concerned, or the children with whom they will be educated. </p><p>The greater proportion of children with Autism attend mainstream classes, but some require the environment of a special class or special school. This decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment and in consultation with the NCSE. </p><p>Special schools funded by my Department are intended to cater for children and young persons with special educational needs from the age of 4 years until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th year.</p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. </p><p>Accordingly, the NCSE advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible. Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process.</p><p>The NCSE is responsible, through it's network of Special Needs Organisers, for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements. </p><p>124 special schools provide specialist education for those students with the most complex special educational needs, including students diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  </p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are ASD special classes.</p><p>There are 37 special schools and 237 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Co.

This process is ongoing.</p><p>While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand nationally. From time to time, the Council identifies local areas where additional provision is required. In those circumstances, SENOs work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved.</p><p>My Department is aware that the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 when commenced will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. </p><p>Section 8 of the Act, which commenced Monday 3rd December 2018, will provide me with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the Board of Management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

Each oral examination would have taken place on the same day as the interview at the HEIs concerned, adding considerably to the stress on candidates.</p>  <p>  I believe the plan that the four institutions of Initial Teacher Education have put in place will streamline the process for primary teaching candidates, who will only have to do one Irish oral test as part of their application for the PME, instead of three. I believe that this will reduce anxiety and help candidates to give their best.</p>  <p>  I also wish to draw your attention to my announcement of today in relation to the deferral of the introduction of the new minimum entry requirements for Primary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) students starting a Professional Master of Education from September 2019 to 2020. </p>  <p>  This deferral is for students who have commenced an undergraduate degree (as distinct from a Bachelor of Education degree) and are planning to apply for the Professional Masters of Education (PME) for entry in September 2019.  This deferral means that those particular students will have to meet the new entry requirements from September 2020, instead of 2019.</p>  <p>   I am assured that the necessary arrangements to accommodate students who didn&rsquo;t make the January deadline are now being put in place.</p></reply>

The SEC has been working on plans to move from a paper-based to an on-line marking system for the examinations. On-line marking involves examiners viewing scanned images of candidate scripts on screen, (instead of looking at the original paper version).  The scripts are scanned following receipt from the examination centres and thereafter are an electronic document.   On-line examination marking of scanned examination scripts is widely used by almost all examinations boards in the UK.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the SEC that it went to the market on 22nd December 2017 in order to procure a service provider to assist in the transition to on-line marking over the five year period 2018-2022.  This was a public procurement process, operated under EU and national procurement regulations, for a Script Scanning and On-line Marking Solution for the state certificate examinations with the publication of a Request for Tender (RFT) on the eTenders website and in the Official Journal of the European Union.  The deadline for submission of bids was 13 February 2018.  Following a period of evaluation, the SEC notified the bidders in the process of the outcome on 28 March 2018.  Bidders were notified that under EU rules a formal contract could not be put in place until at least 14 days had elapsed following the date of the notification.  During the standstill period the SEC was notified of a legal challenge to the procurement process brought by one of the bidders to the process.  </p>  <p>  By placing a contract at the end of the mandatory standstill period, the delivery by the SEC of on-line marking at the planned level for the 2018 examinations was achievable.  However, the interruption to these plans, as a result of the legal proceedings, resulted in the SEC cancelling plans to proceed with on-line marking for the 2018 state examinations and to collapse the procurement process for pragmatic reasons.  Without a clear view of the likely duration or impact of the legal proceedings the SEC made this decision in order to safeguard the delivery of the 2018 examinations, as urgent arrangements had to be made to mark all examinations in a paper format, rather than some in a digital format as hadbeen planned.     </p>  <p>   The RFT was clear that no commitment of any kind, contractual or otherwise, existed until such time as a formal written contract had been executed by the SEC.  The RFT was also clear that the SEC was within its rights to cancel the public procurement competition at any time prior to a formal written contract being put in place.  </p>  <p>   The SEC advises my Department that it rejects any assertion that there was any improper action on the part of the Commission or its officials during the tender process and that there was full compliance with all national and EU procurement regulations in all aspects of the process, including the decision to collapse the tender on pragmatic grounds.

It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. </p>  <p>  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President on 18 July 2018, is an important piece of legislation which will introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country and a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils. </p></reply>

The HP Index combines three underlying dimensions of affluence/disadvantage, identified as Demographic Profile, Social Class Composition and Labour Market Situation, to achieve a balanced measure of relative affluence and deprivation, which evenly applies across the urban-rural continuum.Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, single parent rates, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.  </p><p>The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school is based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined and is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides.</p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process under DEIS plan 2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at<i></i></p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This is turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this requires the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses. Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  </p><p>Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of the address data and conduct further analysis it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools until this work is complete. </p></reply>

The Committee requested that my Department undertake an economic examination of the three policy options proposed by the expert group to assist the Committee in forming its view of the most appropriate option. </p>  <p>   In Q4 2018, my Department applied to the European Commission Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP) which provides tailor-made support to all EU countries for their institutional, administrative and growth-enhancing reforms to carry out the analysis of the three policy options identified by the Expert Group.  Formal decision-making by the European Commission on projects that have been successful in obtaining support is expected by end-February 2019.</p>  <p>  Having this evaluation undertaken through the Commission&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme will provide the type of international expertise and analysis that would be very beneficial to a major evaluation of this nature.</p>  <p>   If the proposal is approved by the European Commission the detailed programme of work for a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options identified by the Expert Group would be expected to be completed in the course of 2019.  The expected timeframe for undertaking the economic evaluation and the Government&rsquo;s concerns regarding Irish students incurring on graduation high levels of debt for tuition fees corresponding to those currently experienced by students in the UK and the US, therefore, rule out the introduction of a student loan system during the lifetime of this Government.   </p>  <p>   My Department is working to continue re-investment in Higher Education, building on the progress made in Budgets 2017 &amp;amp; 2018. Overall higher education spending has increased by 17% compared to 2016 to a projected &euro;1.76 billion in 2019. This represents an increase to the sector of &euro;257m during the period.  </p>  <p>   Budget 2019 continued the Government&rsquo;s prioritisation of reinvestment in higher education. Through the budget, I secured &euro;57million in additional current funding for the higher education sector.

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,318 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. A teacher hired in September 2011 will see their salary increase from &euro;45,200 in September 2018 to &euro;53,062 in September 2020 under the PSSA agreement and the proposed 24 September agreement. </p><p>Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p><p>The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). </p><p>The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p><p>On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. </p><p>This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p><p>These restorations for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. </p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.</p>  <p>  These schemes have been superseded by the more  extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration will, from 1 January 2019, be paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff was improved in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p>  <p>  My Department has shown a willingness to engage with staff representatives as evidenced by the Chairman's Note discussions. Officials of my Department meet regularly with Forsa and other unions on a range of issues.</p></reply>

My officials in the Irish Prison Service have informed me that the current operational capacity figure for the Prison is 296 and that in 2018 the average daily population figure was 288.  </p>  <p>  The prison system is, of course, subject to peaks and troughs.  Numbers can be particularly high when Courts are at their busiest, giving rise to a high number of committals.  While there were 314 prisoners in Cork Prison on 4 July 2018, through a combination of temporary and full release and transfers to other prisons, my officials in the Irish Prison Service reduced this number over the following week to 288 prisoners on 11 July 2018. </p>  <p>  It has to be acknowledged that the Irish Prison Service does not have the option of refusing committals and is required by law to accept all prisoners into their custody who have been committed to prison by the Courts.  The Irish Prison Service therefore has no control over the numbers committed to custody at any given time.  </p>  <p>  Where the number of prisoners exceeds the maximum capacity in any prison, my officials make every effort to deal with this through a combination of inter-prison transfers and structured Temporary Release, as happened in Cork Prison on this occasion.  Decisions in relation to temporary release are considered on a case by case basis and the safety of the public is paramount when those decisions are made.</p>  <p>  However, where it is not possible to reduce the capacity of a given prison in this manner, prisons may be required to operate in excess of their official bed capacity.  Every effort is made by the Irish Prison Service to ensure that this requirement is limited in duration.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of over 6% over the initial allocation for 2018.</p>  <p>  Very significant capital investment is also being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable; investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet over the same period; as well as considerable capital investment in addressing the deficiencies in the Garda estate.  This investment is in support of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to ensure that their best possible use.  This includes responsibility for the formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations, taking into account crime trends and policing priorities. </p>  <p>  In that regard, I would recall that the Programme for a Partnership Government included a commitment for a review of Garda districts and dispersement of resources.  The resulting report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate entitled &ldquo;Policing with Local Communities&rdquo;, which was submitted to me as Minister by the Policing Authority and published in December 2018, also finds that the responsibility for decisions on boundaries and dispersement of Garda resources &ndash; including the number, type and location of Garda stations - should rest with the Garda Commissioner, as is currently the case.  </p>  <p>  I understand from the Garda authorities that Castletroy, the area referred to by the Deputy, is located on the N7 Limerick &ndash; Dublin road and that there are three existing Garda stations between 5 and 10 kilometres away (Henry Street Garda station, Roxboro Road Garda station and Castleconnell Garda station).  I understand that in addition, a weekly Garda Clinic is run on campus at the University of Limerick by Community Policing members based in the Henry Street District, to cater for student requirements (currently held on Wednesdays, from 13:00 -14.30). </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities of a range of other ongoing engagements, for instance the Community Policing Coordinator for Limerick and members of Community Policing sit on the Community Liaison Committee which allows for representatives from the University, Student Services, local residents associations and the Local Authority to engage regularly in relation to campus and community related matters. </p>  <p>   The Garda authorities further advise me that thefts from cars and burglaries in the area are specifically targeted by Operation Disruption.  This operation also involves active patrolling of the area by plain clothes Garda&iacute; in unmarked Garda vehicles.  I understand that Garda&iacute; allocated to Henry Street station are also tasked with performing Mandatory Intoxication checkpoints in Castletroy.  Finally, the headquarters of the Divisional Specialised Units including Detective, Special Branch, Traffic Corps and Drug Unit are located only approximately 5 km from Castletroy.  </p>  <p>   In these circumstances, I am informed that the Garda do not propose a new station in Castletroy at the present time.</p></reply>

This was issued in response to the urgent and unforeseen demand for accommodation and related services from those persons arriving in the state seeking international protection. </p>  <p>  The criteria against which the Department assessed the offers of accommodation were availability, standard of property, ability to provide communal social spaces for residents, ability to cater at mealtimes and proximity to various other services. </p>  <p>  Following the call for expressions of interest in January 2018, the Temple Spa Hotel was offered to the Department and the premises was opened as an accommodation centre on the 30th April 2018 with a contracted capacity of 80 persons.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that these premises were offered voluntarily to the Department by individual contractors across the country; the locations involved reflect that fact, rather than any specific choice made by the Department. </p>  <p>  To ensure the residents have access to transport, RIA ensured this formed the basis of the contractual agreement.  Currently, a bus service is provided from the centre to Moate and back on a daily basis and in addition a bus goes from the centre to Athlone and back twice a week.</p>  <p>  I would like to note that the centre was opened on an emergency and time-limited basis. </p>  <p>  In order to meet the accommodation needs of asylum seekers in the longer term, the Department has recently commenced a public procurement exercise under which public tenders for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services to persons in the protection process, by way of the independent living model, will be advertised.  This process is scheduled to continue throughout 2019 and is due for completion in 2020.  This will be delivered via a series of regional competitions to cover the entire State.</p></reply>

This situation must be thoroughly addressed, not only for the victims and the proper administration of Justice, but also for the future welfare of children who are often themselves quite vulnerable and who may go on to commit other crimes. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, it is important to understand that the issues in question relate to youth crime cases deemed unsuitable for the Garda Diversion Programme. There are therefore no negative implications for the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme itself, which has operated successfully for many years, helping generations of young offenders turn away from crime. </p>  <p>  The Policing Authority's public meeting with the Commissioner last week arose from an Interim Report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As the Commissioner informed the Authority, further work is required to complete the detailed examination of these matters, including external validation which I understand is ongoing.  The Deputy will appreciate that due to the sensitivity of some aspects of the Garda review, consideration of the precise details which might be put into the public domain will remain a matter for the Commissioner. </p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have taken a number of organisational steps to prevent recurrence of the failures identified.  The Commissioner has also established a National Bureau for Child Diversion to improve future management of this whole area. While there have been significant improvements, there is more to be done to achieve a comprehensive solution. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner has been very clear that alleged failings by individual Garda&iacute; will be fully investigated at Divisional level. The Deputy will appreciate that this is a matter for the Commissioner and his management team and any process of that kind has to be allowed to take its course and cannot be pre-judged. </p>  <p>  The Policing Authority, which was established to provide independent oversight of policing, has indicated that it will follow through with further detailed examination of this matter and the remedial actions which are being taken. I can assure the Deputy that I will keep in very close touch with the Commissioner, and the Policing Authority, to monitor progress on the steps being taken.</p></reply>

There are upwards of 700 persons residing in accommodation who have permission to remain in Ireland or who have received international protection status. </p><p>In order to ensure that the State can continue to provide material reception conditions for all protection applicants and continue to comply with the EU Reception Directive which was transposed into Irish law in June of this year, RIA has, since last September, arranged for the provision of emergency beds where the mainstream accommodation centres were at capacity.  This was done by contacting a large number of accommodation providers and also through a national print advertisement seeking expressions of interest for providing emergency accommodation on a short term basis.  RIA is hoping to increase the capacity of the mainstream system by opening new centres.</p><p>The contact person given for each emergency short term accommodation provider is usually the hotel management.  RIA does not have exclusive use of any of these emergency hotels and they continue to operate as commercial entities. Applicants are accommodated there for a short period before they are moved into mainstream accommodation system where they will have full access to all the services provided by  the State to protection applicants. Staff in my Department and other Departments and agencies that provide assistance are in close contact with the management of each hotel to ensure that needs are met as necessary. </p></reply>

I have also indicated that I had sought the advice of the Attorney General on how I should proceed in the context of the resolution passed by this House last June calling for a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the tragic incident in which Shane O'Farrell lost his life.</p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that the outcome of GSOC's criminal investigation into complaints made by members of the family of Shane O'Farrell and following a referral by my predecessor was set out in an interim report issued last year.  That investigation concluded that no criminal misbehaviour by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was disclosed.  GSOC's investigation found that, while no conduct occurred which would require criminal sanction, certain aspects were identified as requiring further investigation which may lead to disciplinary proceedings against one or more members.  The investigation of those matters by GSOC is still on-going.  In the circumstances I do not propose to comment further while the investigation is proceeding.  I know that it can be frustrating that investigations are not completed as quickly as people would like.  However, our overriding concern must be that investigations are comprehensive and conducted to the highest standards. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I am acutely conscious of my responsibility, and that of all Members of the House, to respect the independence of the Ombudsman Commission and guard against improper interference with its investigations. </p>  <p>  With regard to the motion passed by this House last June, it referred to the need to examine the actions of the Garda&iacute;, the Director of Public Prosecutions, GSOC and the Courts.  I would remind the House of the constitutional independence of the Courts and the statutory independence of the Garda&iacute;, the Director of Public Prosecutions and GSOC.  These are important matters which must be taken into consideration if there is to be a further examination or investigation of issues related to this tragic case.</p>  <p>  Having considered the options which appear to be available to me, I have, as I have already said, sought the advice of the Attorney General to determine how I may proceed in relation to the terms of the motion. </p>  <p>  I have received that advice and I am currently considering the options open to me.  Once I have completed that consideration, which I expect to have done shortly, I will inform all interested parties, including the O'Farrell family.</p></reply>

The IPAT operates an email service that can be contacted by individuals with any queries regarding their application - info@protectionappeals.ie. As with the IPO recommendation letters, if an applicant receives a decision letter from the IPAT indicating that a negative recommendation from the IPO has been set aside, she or he should be aware that certain processing procedures are due from this point on and that they should allow a period of time for the Minister's decision to issue and not to anticipate an immediate grant.</p>  <p>  Applicants can be assured that, having received a recommendation letter from the IPO or a decision from the IPAT in relation to an appeal, they will hear from the Minister as soon as possible in relation to their application.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-29a.624.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900070#WRN03800"><p>Ireland is a small open, export driven economy and as such Free Trade and Free Trade Agreements are vitally important to our ability to develop and prosper. We can see from both our membership of the EU and successful economic strategy, that Ireland has benefitted hugely from an open and fair, trading environment. Free trade has increased our collective prosperity, facilitated job creation and has allowed the Irish Government to develop and continue to invest in and support its key strategic objectives, including my Department's Innovation 2020, Enterprise 2025, and the Future Jobs Initiative. These strategies are designed to secure Ireland's economy into the future and an underlying tenant of that overarching objective is our ability to trade globally in an unrestricted and fair way.</p>  <p>  Restrictions on foreign trade often results in poorer economic prospects for all trading countries. Restrictions on trade can also have very negative impacts on countries that are less developed, as their access to markets in which to sell their goods and thus generate wealth is unfairly constrained. Consumers here can also feel the impacts on trade restrictions when goods coming into the country are levied with tariffs, making them expensive and unaffordable. </p>  <p>  The ability to trade freely is therefore important for our consumers and for driving global economic growth. Free Trade also drives enhanced efficiency, increases innovation, and creates greater fairness. Over time Free Trade results in higher wages, the ability to invest in infrastructure, and builds a dynamic economy that can create new jobs and opportunities. </p>  <p>  Ireland, through its membership of the EU, exerts a great deal of influence in relation to trade and the development of a sustainable trade model through the agreed structures of the WTO. </p>  <p>  Within the EU, Ireland works actively with other Member States to ensure that our concerns regarding the impacts of restrictions to free and open trade - which can have a disproportionate effect on small, open economies like ours - are heard at EU level.  The EU itself is pro-active in trying to address issues at International Level regarding restrictions to free trade.</p>  <p>  Of course, International Trade Policy is a competence of the EU Commission under the EU Treaties and defined as the Common Commercial Policy.  Under this architecture the Commission makes legislative proposals and leads on international trade negotiations and the Member States approve negotiating directives (mandates) and engage with the Commission on the substance of all trade proposals through various Committees, including the Trade Policy Committee, and at Ministerial level through the Trade Council.  Equally, Member States, at Council level, approve or reject the terms of Free Trade Agreements when negotiated.  The European Union has in place free trade agreements with Korea and Canada as well as having successfully concluded trade negotiations with Japan Singapore, Vietnam and Mexico and has active negotiations with Mercosur, Chile, Australia and New Zealand. These agreements, on terms that are mutually beneficial to all parties assist with liberalising trade, removing barriers and de-escalating possible trade tensions. </p>  <p>  The European Union proactively engages with 3rd countries to de-escalate trade disputes as can be witnessed in the EU's current engagement with the US over its recently applied tariffs on Steel imports. </p>  <p>  The EU has robust measures in place to respond to trade disputes and officials from my Department are effectively engaged in both Brussels and elsewhere in resolving trade disputes in a fair and transparent manner. </p>  <p>  In a broader context, Ireland fully supports the multilateral, rules-based, global trading system, embodied by the WTO, of which it is a member through the EU.  An effective WTO system is an essential element of a fully functioning rules based, free trade system.  </p>  <p>  A key pillar of the WTO is its mechanisms for resolving trade disputes. Its dispute settlement system is central to ensuring that global trade is fair, and rules based. It is important that members of the WTO abide by the agreed procedures laid down in the legal texts and due respect is given to the judgements made on cases brought before the adjudicating body of the WTO. </p>  <p>  Of course, over time, the functioning of any organisation must be reviewed and renewed to embed what is working well and to update what functions less well.  In that regard, Ireland fully supports the European Union's position regarding the need for the WTO to urgently pursue an ambitious reform agenda to address structural problems which for some Member Countries inhibit the WTO from progressing further agreements and potentially limiting its ability to fairly arbitrate trade disputes. </p>  <p>  To this end, Ireland has welcomed the ongoing trilateral engagement between the EU, the United States and Japan as a way of seeking to develop constructive proposals to address essential aspects of WTO reform.  We have also supported the EU's engagement with the recent Canadian initiative on WTO reform and the communique issued by the EU and several partner countries at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos which aims to further these endeavours. Of course, the EU remains in dialogue with many other WTO members as well.</p>  <p>  We remain fully supportive of the EU efforts to lead on WTO Reform and believe the Commission's proposals are key in driving this process forward.  </p>  <p>  Ireland, through the EU, will continue to work in proposing solutions and responding constructively to proposals from others so that we can improve the WTO's functioning in the delivery of a fair, rules based, multilateral system in an effort to limit expensive and needless trade wars between important trading partners.</p></reply>

They agreed to:</p>  <p>  - work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies (on non-auto industrial goods) and to work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans (the EU will import soybeans from the US),</p>  <p>  - strengthen strategic energy cooperation to potentially increase US imports of (LNG) to diversify the EU's energy supply,</p>  <p>  - launch a close dialogue on standards to ease trade barriers, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs, and</p>  <p>  - work closely together with like-minded partners to reform the WTO and to address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state owned enterprises, and overcapacity.</p>  <p>  The meeting was in response to a shift in the direction of US trade policy which had seen the US impose tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminium (10%) imports from the EU to the US from 1 June 2018, following the expiry of a temporary exemption.  The US measures were introduced following a "Section 232" investigation by the US Department of Commerce, into the effect of imports of steel and aluminium on US national security.  The EU did not accept the basis for the US action and responded, after initial dialogue with the US Authorities failed to resolve the matter.  Our collective response comprised:</p>  <p>  - the launching of proceedings by the EU against the US at the WTO for breaching WTO rules, as the measures are designed to protect US domestic industry from import competition and not a national security measure, </p>  <p>  - introducing rebalancing tariff measures through removing existing tariff concessions and applying 25% duties on a number of US imports to the EU in a proportionate manner, and </p>  <p>  - introducing provisional safeguard measures, following an investigation, for a period of 200 days by imposing a tariff rate quota and an additional 25% tariff on imports of certain of steel products from third countries, with the exception of some developing countries with limited exports to the EU.  These safeguards are likely to be made definitive in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The EU is unanimously of the view that these US tariffs, which remain in place, are unjustified and in conflict with WTO rules.  Ireland has fully endorsed the EU strategy and as part of this process I met with US Commerce Secretary Ross and other US actors on 7 May 2018 to discuss the issues.</p>  <p>  On 10 September 2018, EU Trade Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m met U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Lighthizer to initiate the Executive Working Group (EWG), established to improve trade relations between the US and EU and address each of the topics in the Joint Statement issued by Presidents Juncker and Trump at their July meeting.  The EWG has met a number of times since, to discuss the scope of future formal negotiations, most recently in Washington on 9 January 2019. </p>  <p>  I and my other EU Trade Minister colleagues have discussed the issue of EU-US trade relations at our Council meetings in October and November 2018.  Ireland has made clear to the EU Commission that agriculture must remain excluded from the scope of any future agreement with the US and I have spoken with Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m who confirmed to me that this is the EU Commission position.  Indeed, the EU has made this clear on several occasions.  </p>  <p>  On 18 January 2019 the EU Commission adopted proposals for negotiating directives for its trade talks with the United States: one on conformity assessment, and one on the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods (excluding agricultural products).  As part of its commitment to transparency, the EU Commission published the draft mandates at the same time as submitting them to the EU Member States.  These mandates - or negotiating directives - will be discussed and agreed by Member States in Council to ensure that we are satisfied that EU - including Irish - interests are fully represented.  Once approved, they should form the basis that will hopefully see productive and substantive formal negotiations in these areas commence soon after, which would also see the removal of US steel and aluminium tariffs and the EU rebalancing measures.  Additionally, it is important to note that while these negotiations are proceeding both sides are committed to not introducing new tariff measures and if the US were to so do, the proposed mandates make clear that the EU will suspend the negotiations and consider an appropriate and proportionate response.</p>  <p>  The USTR also published its Negotiating Objectives this month and is in dialogue with Congress on them. </p>  <p>  As with all trade negotiations, my Department will continue to prioritise Ireland's interests and play a full part, especially through the EU's Trade Policy Committee, in securing a mutually beneficial deal between the EU and US.  As part of the effort to prioritise Ireland's interests in any future negotiations, my Department has commenced a consultation process with relevant stakeholders on the proposed mandates.</p>  <p>  Ireland and the US have a significant bilateral relationship based on the same values and interests that has proved indispensable for the prosperity of both sides of the Atlantic.  Ireland and the EU remain fully committed to a continued strong partnership with the US as equal partners.  The de-escalation in trade tensions between the US and EU achieved by last July's accord has been of benefit to Irish trade interests and jobs.  Equally, continuing to dialogue with the US to achieve a possible agreement on the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods, would be a positive development for Irish trade and jobs.</p></reply>

The package of Brexit supports encompasses finance, advisory and awareness.  My Department's focus is on helping firms to improve their competitiveness and innovation, and to diversify markets.  </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are working to provide extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. The suite of enterprise and finance supports now in place covers the spectrum of potential Brexit impacts and aims to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I made Brexit one of my top priorities in the allocations of funding for 2019 in my Department and I have allocated further funding to Brexit-related support from agencies and offices of my Department as part of Budget 2019. I have allocated an additional &euro;5 million capital funding to the Local Enterprise Offices, an increase of 22% for 2019, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTrade Ireland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. I have allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland to expand their global footprints and drive the diversification of trade and investment. Additional resources have also been distributed across Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority and the NSAI for 2019 to support enterprises adjust to the new relationships with the UK and pursue new opportunities.</p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland (ITI) works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. </p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. </p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms.  As of its most recent report and the end of November 2018, 811 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 657 have been approved. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in the Border Regions are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, 402 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.</p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.</p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme. The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. </p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme. </p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 18th January, there have been 376 eligibility applications received of which 337 eligibility applications have been approved and 65 loans progressed to sanction at Bank level to a value of &euro;14.9m.  Brexit impacted exporters account for almost 50% of approvals while manufacturing accounts for 38% of approvals and 20% of approved applications relate to investments in new products or markets.</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  The SBCI has issued an &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial institutions to apply by 11 February 2019 for designation as a lending partner under the Scheme. It is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p>  <p>  Over 3,700 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions. EI is working closely with regionally-important larger companies in exposed sectors such as food to support strategic investments to build resilience &ndash; EI invested&euro;74 million in these businesses in 2018. EI has also hosted 11 Brexit Advisory Clinics. </p>  <p>  In addition, eligible EI client companies can respond to the threats and opportunities posed by Brexit by accessing the Agile Innovation Fund.  This fund supports clients to quickly develop innovations and respond to opportunities and threats in new and existing markets. The new Fund allows companies to access up to 50% in support of innovation projects with a total cost of up to &euro;300,000. A recent EI survey showed that EI clients that have availed of Innovation Capability, Funding and Collaboration support saw a 67% increase in global sales.</p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a new Customs Insights Online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. </p>  <p>  The majority of the above schemes are open to all SMEs, not just agency clients. Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. </p>  <p>  In my meeting with Commissioner Vestager on 24th January 2019, we discussed the severe challenges that Irish businesses, especially SMEs, will face when the UK leaves the European Union and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.  We agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner&rsquo;s team in addressing any State aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implications become known.  The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.</p>  <p>  In addition, in November 2017, the Commission approved a Rescue and Restructuring Scheme for Ireland for Undertakings in Difficulty.  Under the scheme, an undertaking is considered to be in difficulty when, without intervention by the State, it will almost certainly be condemned to going out of business in the short or medium term.</p>  <p>  This scheme was put in place as it was considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that my Department can respond swiftly to changing circumstances as necessary.  In May 2018 this scheme was extended to include Temporary Restructuring support for those enterprises with acute liquidity needs.  To date, no enterprise has sought rescue and restructuring aid for temporary restructuring support.</p>  <p>  With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario. </p></reply>

Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA.  </p><p>Further to the table, increased funding has been allocated to Brexit-related support from my Department and its agencies as part of Budget 2019. An additional &euro;5 million capital funding has been allocated to the Local Enterprise Offices, an increase of 22%, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to Intertrade Ireland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. Additional resources have also been distributed across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. This scheme is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m, with terms of 8 to 10 years, will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  The SBCI has issued an &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial institutions to apply by 11 February 2019 for designation as a lending partner under the Scheme. It is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.</p><p>While many businesses have taken preparedness actions, a number have yet to do so. It is vital that businesses prepare themselves for Brexit impacts and take actions to mitigate. Firms that do business with the UK, whether buying goods or exporting products, should examine their supply chains to determine their vulnerabilities and take appropriate action.<table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Uptake (18.01)</th></tr><tr><td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td><td>375 applications received, 336 approved by SBCI, 65 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;14.94 million.</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit </td><td>3,902 Brexit Scorecards have been completed. 681 LEO clients have completed the scorecard.</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant</td><td>155 Be Prepared Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new   markets</td><td>209 projects have been approved under this initiative</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding</td><td>39 Agile Innovation projects have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics</td><td>11 Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with approx. 915 in attendance</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience</td><td>165 &ldquo;Act on&rdquo; Plans have been completed</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period</td><td>1,049 Strategic Consultancy Grants have been approved</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit-exposed companies that have completed sustainable growth plans</td><td>706</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Technical Assistance Grant   for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities</td><td>419 clients were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant</td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients</td><td>221 LEO clients have participated in the programme </td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring</td><td>471 mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit </td></tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Brexit Seminars/Events </td><td>3,996 Participants at the Brexit Information events </td></tr><tr><td>InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service</td><td>4,175 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2018</td></tr><tr><td>InterTradeIreland Brexit Start to Plan Vouchers</td><td>There have been 811 applications, with 657 approved and 25 still pending assessment. </td></tr><tr><td>Pilot Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland</td><td>Applications are currently being assessed by Enterprise Ireland and the successful applicants will be announced in Q1 2019.

In that regard, I recently announced allocations under the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund. A number of the projects that have been offered funding are already prototype digital Hubs and should develop throughout the duration of their project into sustainable ehubs in their own right.  </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to working with companies of all sizes and across all sectors to develop and achieve their potential including in developing strong digital resources and skills in order to remain competitive.</p></reply>

There are now 3,903 people employed in IDA client companies in Louth with 139 net new jobs added in 2018. The new National Development Plan recognises the importance of Dundalk and Drogheda as key centres in the context of the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor. Both towns have a strong track record in attracting multinational companies due to the quality of the local infrastructure as well as their proximity to Dublin's transport hubs. I am therefore confident that we will be able to sustain and grow investment levels in County Louth, including in Drogheda.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland (EI) supported companies employed 215,207 people throughout Ireland in 2018. EI is actively working with companies in Louth to drive competitiveness, innovation and market diversification.

This audit should be completed by mid-2019. </p><p>It is important to note that grants paid in a particular year are not necessarily linked to either the investments won or the jobs created in that 12-month period.

However, I can advise the Deputy that the registration of proposed company names is determined by the Companies Registration Office pursuant to the provisions of Sections 26 and 30 of the Companies Act 2014. Certain words prohibited by statute are not allowed to be used in company names. Some generic words are not sufficient to distinguish similar company names. In this regard applications are considered on the basis of the similarity of the proposed company name and names by which companies in existence are already registered. Details of general company names criteria can be found in CRO Information Leaflet No. 1 which is available at <i>.</i></p><p>I am informed that it is the policy of the Registrar of Companies not to permit domain suffixes in company names. The word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; is permitted in company names.  However, the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; would not be considered to be sufficiently distinctive if the proposed company name was otherwise too similar to that of a company already on the register.</p><p>Should an applicant wish to appeal the refusal of a company name by the Companies Registration Office, she/he may appeal in writing to the Registrar of Companies.

No. 14 of 2011, places the onus on economic operators &ndash; manufacturers, distributors, importers &ndash; to ensure that only safe toys are placed on the market. If economic operators become aware that products on the market present a potential hazard they must take appropriate measures, up to and including recall of the items, to ensure that the risk is removed. Any action taken by an operator must be notified to the relevant Market Surveillance Authority: in Ireland this is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC).</p>  <p>  Where the CCPC finds unsafe toys on the Irish market, it will act to ensure economic operators remove the particular toy from the market until it is in compliance with the legislation. The CCPC is part of an EU wide network (known as Safety Gate) that allows for the rapid exchange of information between national market surveillance authorities on dangerous products, including toys, found on the EU market. </p>  <p>  Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations of unsafe toys. As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC, I, as the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation have no direct function in the matter.</p>  <p>  Should the Deputy have any information in relation to unsafe toys on the Irish market, he should make contact with the CCPC directly to provide any relevant information on these matters.</p>  <p>  In relation to standards, economic operators can demonstrate conformity with the safety requirements of Directive 2009/48/EC when they comply with certain voluntary European Union (EU) harmonised standards. EU standards are based on a consensus, which reflects the economic and social interests of 34 European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) Member countries channeled through their National Standardization Organizations (in Ireland, this is the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI)). CEN, in Technical Committee 52, develops the standards concerned with toy safety. The evolution of the relevant standards has taken into account new types of toys and technologies, and thereby potential new hazards. </p></reply>

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland as a result of significant media coverage of the issues that emerged in late April. </p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening. </p>  <p>  This increased level of engagement with the programme is very welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put immense pressure on lab capacity and the HSE has advised that, currently, results of smear tests may take up to 22 weeks from the time of the test. Although many results are returned in less time, some may take longer.</p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. The HSE reports that laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, provide for overtime and manage annual leave in an effort to minimise the backlog. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results. However, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan to take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year. This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE. </p></reply>

A systematic review of all relevant international literature was performed that encompassed 70,000 trial participants and surveillance of many millions of individuals in cohort studies, and had a follow up of up to ten years.  Ireland-specific safety data from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) were reported in the HTA.  </p>  <p>  A Norwegian definition of &lsquo;serious adverse events&rsquo; was not used in HIQA&rsquo;s safety assessment of HPV vaccines.  The review noted that a single agreed definition of serious adverse event is not applied across safety studies.  Consistent with all national adverse reaction reporting schemes, HPRA safety data must be interpreted with caution, as they relate to &lsquo;suspected&rsquo; adverse events that are not always medically confirmed.  In the absence of validated Irish data on hospitalisation rates for HPV-associated adverse events, Norwegian data was used to inform estimates of these costs in the economic model.</p></reply>

Following  consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time. I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

The process of drafting this Bill will be completed in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. In addition, the Joint Committee on Health is currently conducting a review of the General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill 2017 as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, which began in January of last year. The review is on-going and the Committee intends to publish its report early this year. However, it is not possible at this time to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  In order to support the commencement of the legislation, officials in my Department are working with the HSE to develop a model of care for infertility to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology. </p>  <p>  The Government has approved a &euro;1 million fund for use in relation to providing public AHR treatment during 2019. Officials in my Department are currently examining options in relation to the operation and administration of this fund, which includes determining the access criteria that will apply. Once I have had the opportunity to review and approve these proposals, there will be an announcement regarding the commencement of this fund for 2019.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, currently, patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme. In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Scheme administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Scheme must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and approved by the HSE &lsquo;High Tech Liaison Officers&rsquo;. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.</p></reply>

This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.</p>  <p>  The Beneluxa collaboration was established in 2015, with a view to taking a collective approach to pharmaceutical procurement and evaluation. The main objectives of this Initiative are to enhance patients' access to high quality and affordable treatments, improve the payers' position in the market through joint negotiations, increase transparency on pricing between the collaborating countries, share policy expertise and focus on knowledge building and enable national health challenges to be anticipated more effectively through the use of horizon scanning.</p>  <p>  This Initiative is well established, with clear goals and a pragmatic approach to delivering on its objectives. Four areas of collaboration have been identified and there are four Domain Task Forces: horizon scanning, health technology assessment, information sharing and policy exchange and joint price negotiations.  </p>  <p>  The working methods of the initiative are face to face meetings, and via video conferencing, teleconference and web based meetings. A number of meetings have taken place since Ireland became a member in June 2018.  Officials from My Department have attended 2 physical meetings and representatives from the HSE have attended 1 meeting abroad.  Regular teleconferences take place within the Domain Task Forces and Ireland is represented by officials from the HSE during these meetings. A Beneluxa webinar was held in December 2018.  </p>  <p>  Beneluxa works together closely on horizon scanning, to explore which innovative medicines are expected to reach the market in the near future.  In this context, a project is on-going on the development of an International Horizon Scanning Initiative (IHSI), which seeks to build a permanent horizon scanning system that can support countries and institutions in policy planning and their decision making regarding the reimbursement of new pharmaceuticals. In addition, the Beneluxa partners conduct joint health technology assessments and share data and policies. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a recurrent theme on the Agenda of previous Council Presidencies has been the topic of access to medication and I am pleased that the Romanian Presidency are continuing efforts to ensure that this topic remains at the forefront. The Romanian Presidency will continue the negotiations in the Council on the proposal for a Regulation on coordination in health technology assessment and it has indicated that it intends to organise debates on patient mobility and to encourage cooperation between Member States in the treatment of patients under the age of 18 who suffer from rare diseases. I look forward to working with colleagues over the duration of the Romanian Presidency to advancing the agenda of finding workable solutions to the challenges which exist in relation to medicines pricing, sustainability and supply.</p></reply>

In mental health there are many types of services available in Ireland and it can be difficult to understand what service is most suitable to address an individual&rsquo;s needs. Therefore I have prioritised the establishment of a 24/7 signposting telephone contact line as a single point of contact to assist people locate and be referred to appropriate mental health services in their area. This important project is expected to be piloted in partnership with the National Ambulance Service and ready to proceed in 2019.</p>  <p>  I am also supporting the HSE to provide a crisis digital texting service for those who feel that they are in need of urgent support. People will be able to text a specific number monitored by a trained counsellor responding from a secure online platform. A trained volunteer can then be assigned to the caller to assist the individual immediately. Following the call or texting conversation, appropriate referrals and follow-up work begins.</p>  <p>  In addition to these very important initiatives I am very much committed to expanding the use of digital health technologies to support individuals access greater choice and avail of online therapeutic and educational interventions. I have been working with the HSE on delivering a number of digital services that support my position on the effectiveness of using evidence based online services. </p>  <p>  I am a keen advocate of using online tele-counselling interventions and the HSE are undertaking two six month national pilot projects in South Wicklow and Galway/Mayo. I believe tele-counselling can provide a range of services including psychiatric evaluations, individual, group and family therapy, education and patient management.  There is substantial evidence regarding the effectiveness of tele-counselling and research indicates a high level of patient satisfaction, especially among adolescents and those with autism and severe anxiety disorders.</p>  <p>  I have had the pleasure of attending a digital mental health seminar in Washington and visited health services that excel in delivering tele-psychiatry services in hospital A&amp;D units. I hosted a successful digital health conference in Dublin in September 2018 called 'Changing Direction' which targeted psychiatrist and other mental health clinicians to propose the advantages of using tele-psychiatry services. Because of the success of this promotion, the HSE have established a project steering committee to run two pilot tele-psychiatry projects to conduct remote consultations to address CAMS waiting lists and a second pilot to address adolescent addiction and substance misuse.</p>  <p>  As you will see, while I believe that providing phone services are essential, in this age of digital technology, there are many other options that will augment existing services to deliver appropriate care that will result in wider access, choice and the potential to create additional capacity for clinicians who may wish to work from home.</p></reply>

In responding to these questions and in recognition of the complexity of the matters arising, I requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p><p>a) the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and b) an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures </p><p>Preparation of the report has involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies. The report has been informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years. The report has also been informed by the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.</p><p>The Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p><p>The Report makes 19 recommendations including:</p><p>- the development of patient information and informed consent materials;</p><p>- surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;</p><p>- the development of clinical guidance;</p><p>- the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;</p><p>- ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and</p><p>- ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications. </p><p>The report was completed and published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018.</p><p>The Secretary General of my Department wrote to the HSE on November 27 2018 to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, to be approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website within three months of receipt of the report, or sooner if completed. It was also requested that a copy of the Implementation Plan, together with an interim report on the implementation of those recommendations on which work has already commenced, should be submitted to the Department at the time of publication of the Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-29a.799.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900074#WRR00900"><p>Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 contain provisions relating to the regulation of donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR) procedures carried out in the State, including dealing with the rights of children born as a result of those procedures. The enactment of the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Act 2018 was necessary to correct typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, to enable the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working towards putting in place a number of important administrative and operational arrangements that are essential for the implementation of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3. This includes the establishment of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register (the &ldquo;Register&rdquo;), the purpose of which is to vindicate the rights of a donor-conceived child to access information on their genetic heritage. This is based on the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child concerning the right of a child to an identity and internationally regarded as best practice. However, as the Register will contain personal and potentially sensitive information about the various parties to a DAHR procedure, and particularly about the children born as a result of the procedures, robust data protection measures must be put in place prior to the establishment of the Register. </p>  <p>  The commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act also requires consent forms relating to the parties to a DAHR procedure (donors and intending parents) to be prescribed by regulations. The Department is liaising with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in relation to the drafting of those regulations.</p>  <p>  In addition, the appointment of authorised persons to ensure compliance of DAHR facilities with their obligations under this Act also needs to be finalised. It is my intention that Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act will be commenced as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The provisions in Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 are interconnected with provisions in other areas of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, particularly Part 9 which includes provisions for the registration and re-registration of the birth of a donor-conceived child. As such, officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health and the General Register Office are working together to ensure that the appropriate legislative, regulatory, and operational mechanisms are in place to allow for the earliest possible commencement of all of the relevant legislation that will allow for birth registrations of donor-conceived children. </p></reply>

There are already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicine supply chain, and these additional stocks, together with planning by Revenue to allow the fast-tracking of essential drugs into Ireland, will help deal with any delays that may arise.</p>  <p>  There is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions. To do so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the HPRA developed and launched a multi-stakeholder Medicine Shortages Framework to anticipate and manage medicine shortages when they occur. This framework is used to manage and address an average of 45 shortage notifications a month.  The health system is therefore well placed to anticipate and respond to any additional shortages, should they arise because of Brexit. Recently, the list of resolved shortages for the past 6 months, available on the HPRA website, contained 24 medicines.</p>  <p>  As an additional safeguard, consideration is being given to those categories of medicines which are considered most essential to public health. HSE and HPRA technical experts are undertaking a process to verify the contingency planning in place for the continuity of supply of medicines essential to public health, in order to determine those medicines that have the potential to be vulnerable to supply disruption and, where necessary, identify clinically appropriate alternatives.

Its recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations so as to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.</p><p>On foot of a recommendation by NIAC, the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule was amended in 2016 to include the introduction of the Meningitis B vaccine for all babies born on or after 1 October 2016.  This change to the immunisation schedule took effect from 1 December 2016.  The first dose of the vaccine is administered to children when they reach two months of age; a second dose is administered at four months and a third and final dose at twelve months.  Meningitis B disease is most common in babies under 1 year of age and the scheduling of the administration of the vaccine under the immunisation programme as recommended by NIAC takes this into account.</p><p>All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the Men B vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme.</p><p>There are no plans to introduce a catch-up programme for the Men B vaccine to older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However, the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme.</p><p>In Ireland, the following meningitis vaccines are provided to children born on or after 1 October 2016 as part of the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule:</p><p>- 2 months - 6-in-1, pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) and Men B;</p><p>- 4 months - 6-in-1 and Men B (Meningococcal B);</p><p>- 6 months - 6-in-1, PCV and Men C (Meningococcal C);</p><p>- 12 months - Men B;</p><p>- 13 months - Hib/Men C and PCV.</p><p>Note that the 6-in-1 vaccine contains Hib (Haemophilus influenzae b).</p><p>Adolescents are also given a Men C booster vaccine in the first year of secondary school against meningitis as part of the School Immunisation Programme.</p><p>It is important to note that, although some of the recent notified cases are related to Meningitis B, none of the deaths have been attributed to this strain of the disease.</p></reply>

Section 13 of the Act provides that the woman, or a person acting on her behalf, may make an application to the HSE for a review of the relevant decision.  Within 3 days of receiving such an application, the HSE must convene a committee of medical practitioners to review the relevant decision.  The committee must complete its review not later than 7 days from the date on which it was established.</p>  <p>  The National Women and Infants Health Programme continues to engage with the Dublin Midlands Health Group and the Coombe Hospital regarding termination of pregnancy service provision.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p>  <p>  In relation to GPs refusing to refer medical card patients to HSE blood test clinics, neither my Department nor the HSE are aware of such an issue.

Approval and funding has been provided for the additional staff required to facilitate this service expansion and five staff - Grade IV Admin, Porter, Senior Cardiac Physiologist, Senior Radiographer and Staff Nurse - have now been recruited on an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. working day basis. Furthermore, the recruitment of a cardiologist to facilitate an increase in the operating hours of the existing cath lab is also being progressed by the HSE. </p>  <p>  A mobile cath lab has also been deployed at UHW since October 2017 to conduct diagnostic cardiac procedures. In Autumn 2018, it was replaced with a relocatable cath lab, operating on the same basis as the mobile cath lab, that is, it carries out diagnostic cardiology procedures only. The contractual arrangements currently in place at UHW are for the provision of a unit capable of carrying out diagnostic cardiac procedures only. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to the provision of a second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford. It is intended that the cost of progressing the project to design, planning and construction stages will be considered in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plan for 2019, which is currently being finalised. </p>  <p>  The Herity Report also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services should cease to allow the hospital focus on the much larger volume of planned work. I asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac cath labs and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally will be informed by the outcome of the National Review, which is expected to be complete by June 2019.</p></reply>

The 50 organisations included were agreed at the WRC by all parties.</p>  <p>  I asked the HSE to engage with the Section 39 organisations to establish the facts around what cuts were applied and how and when they were implemented. The HSE completed the first phase of their work in relation to the agencies identified as part of the WRC process. This exercise has shown that of the agencies who returned data, a majority did apply pay reductions of some form.  It also showed that some agencies made some form of pay restoration between 2016 and 2018. </p>  <p>  Following constructive engagement with the assistance of the Workplace Relations Commission, an agreement was reached on 2 October between the parties. Pay restoration will commence with an annual pay increase of up to &euro;1,000 in April 2019 for those employed by the 50 organisations involved in the pilot. Any outstanding balance will be paid in two equal amounts in 2020 and 2021.   </p>  <p>  The HSE are undertaking a further validation exercise of those 50 pilot organisations and their funding requirements to enable the pay restoration.  Further information was requested from these organisations. Some of the organisations which did not form part of this pilot phase are likely to have pay restoration issues also.  A process of engagement to address this will commence in 2019.</p></reply>

It was in this knowledge that when proposals for the joint HSE/National Treatment Purchase Fund Inpatient and Day Case Action Plan were under development last year, I sought a particular focus on reducing waiting times for a number of high volume specialties including cataracts.  The Action Plan, allocated a quarter (5,000 out of 20,000) of the planned NTPF procedures to cataract treatments.</p><p>Waiting list figures for December 2018, published by the NTPF show that considerable improvements have been made to the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure which have fallen to 70,204 from the peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. Over the same period, the waiting lists for Cataracts has reduced from over 10,000 to 6,440 representing a reduction of 36%.</p><p>In 2018, the Action Plan also recommended that the HSE and NTPF identify sustainable initiatives to improve waiting times. In this context, a dedicated centre for cataract surgery in Nenagh opened last July, and at full capacity will be capable of delivering up to 2,000 procedures annually.  The centre is ideally located to enable the UL hospital group, in collaboration with the HSE and NTPF, to maximise the use of the Centre through collaboration with other hospital groups so that patients from surrounding regions can be referred to the Centre for their treatment.</p><p>In relation to the average wait time for cataract surgery in Co. Limerick, please see the following table.</p><p><i>Average Wait Time for Cataract Surgery Limerick vs Nationally as at 24/01/2019</i><table><tr><th>Date </th><th>Area of Residence </th><th>Average Wait Time (Days) </th></tr><tr><td>24/01/2019 </td><td>Limerick </td><td>148 </td></tr><tr><td>25/01/2019 </td><td>National </td><td>145 </td></tr></table></p><p>In relation the patient query element of the question, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. </p>  <p>  Applicants to the scheme can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  However, in order for financial support to be provided, the nursing home must have an available bed and be able to cater for the applicant's care needs.</p>  <p>  As per the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013, a discharge shall be discussed, planned for and agreed with a resident and, where appropriate, with their family or carer, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract agreed in accordance with Regulation 24.</p>  <p>  Where an issue arises with respect to an individual nursing home, the procedure in place and the best course of action is to engage with the nursing home itself, specifically through its complaints process.  Each nursing home is required, by law, to have a written complaints procedure and to make this clearly available to residents.  Nursing homes are required to investigate all complaints promptly and to provide the complainant with the outcome of the investigation promptly, along with providing an appeal mechanism.</p>  <p>  If the person is unhappy with how their complaint has been processed they can then escalate the complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman, who will examine the issue on their behalf.  There is no charge for this, however, typically the Office of the Ombudsman requires that the person in question has first engaged with the nursing home through the defined complaints process.</p></reply>

Approval and funding has been provided for the additional staff required to facilitate this service expansion and five staff (Grade IV Admin, Porter, Senior Cardiac Physiologist, Senior Radiographer and Staff Nurse) have now been recruited on an 8am to 8pm working day basis.  Furthermore, the recruitment of a cardiologist to facilitate an increase in the operating hours of the existing cath lab is also being progressed by the HSE. </p>  <p>  A mobile cath lab has also been deployed at UHW since October 2017 to conduct diagnostic cardiac procedures.  In Autumn 2018, it was replaced with a relocatable cath lab, operating on the same basis as the mobile cath lab, i.e. it carries out diagnostic cardiology procedures only.  The contractual arrangements currently in place at UHW are for the provision of a unit capable of carrying out diagnostic cardiac procedures only. </p>  <p>  I remain committed to the provision of a second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford.  It is intended that the cost of progressing the project to design, planning and construction stages will be considered in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plan for 2019, which is currently being finalised. </p>  <p>  The Herity Report also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services should cease to allow the hospital focus on the much larger volume of planned work.  I asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.  The aim of this Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service.  As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac cath labs and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally will be informed by the outcome of the National Review, which is expected to be complete by June 2019.</p></reply>

At that time officials of my Department contacted the Health Service Executive (HSE). The HSE  advised that in late October 2018, an error was discovered in correctly communicating a genetic test result by the Department of Clinical Genetics at Our Lady's Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC) following an enquiry by an oncologist for a patient with recurring cancer who had a genetic test, known as a BRCA test, in 2009. Crumlin Hospital commenced reviewing this incident as a matter of the utmost priority.</p>  <p>  This error has been reported as an incident and is being managed in accordance with the HSE Incident and Risk Management policy, including in commencing an incident review process of this transcription error in correctly communicating the test result in a letter to the referring clinician. Direct contact was made with the patient involved in this incident, with an offer made for an Open Disclosure meeting to take place at the discretion of the patient.</p>  <p>  As a precaution, OLCHC also instigated a review of the communication of all BRCA test results since 2006, firstly prioritising the 335 positive BRCA results processed by the Department of Clinical Genetics. I understand that the review carried out in Q4 2018 has concluded but as this is a service matter I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this issue. </p>  <p>  For the sake of clarity, I would also like to stress to the House that there is no concern regarding the accuracy of the BRCA test itself. The error which has occurred relates to the correct communication of the test result.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of everyday living;</p><p>- Laundry service</p><p>The Scheme had a budget of &euro;962 million for 2018, providing support to approximately 23,000 people by the end of the year.  In order to manage the available funds within the budget throughout the year, a national placement list is operated by the HSE. Funding approvals issue to applicants in chronological order. State Support can only be paid from either the date that the application is approved, or the date of admission to the nursing home, whichever is the later.</p><p>In 2018 the time applicants to the Scheme spend on the placement list for funding did not exceed 4 weeks. This target has consistently been achieved since April 2015 and it is a significant reduction from the October 2014 wait time of 15 weeks. The target of 4 weeks for approval of funding remains a commitment in the Programme for Government. </p><p>In relation to the case raised by the Deputy I have asked the HSE to investigate the matter.</p></reply>

In May 2018, I asked CervicalCheck to make the necessary arrangements to provide that any woman who had had a CervicalCheck smear test, and whose GP considered that they should have a further test, to access such a further test without charge. This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland as a result of significant media coverage of the issues that emerged in late April. </p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening. The HSE is working to source additional capacity to manage this backlog, notwithstanding global challenges with cytology capacity and resources, and is also working closely with the laboratories in maximising their capacity to deal with the demand.  It is important to be clear that this issue will take some time to resolve.</p>  <p>  Some women will require to have their test repeated where there were delays in the technical fixing of the slide, a step which must be completed within six weeks of the smear being taken, or where the vail used to contain the sample expires. The HSE has advised that, from April to October 2018, there was a 0.29% rate of expired samples and vials. This is very similar to the same period in 2017 when it was 0.25%. The HSE advises that there are procedures in place to deal with this issue as and when it arises.  </p>  <p>  Where low grade changes are detected on a cervical smear test, a second test which looks for the HPV virus is then carried out. The Deputy will be aware that a separate issue has arisen in relation to this secondary HPV test. The HSE has advised that some HPV tests carried out by Quest Laboratories have been performed outside of the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended timeframe.  The clinical advice is that this issue poses a very low clinical risk to women; however, as a precaution, affected women will be offered a repeat test to provide them with reassurance. It is expected that up to 6,000 women will be invited for a repeat test. The HSE is working to finalise arrangements to communicate with these women.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific number of smear tests which have been repeated or require to be repeated, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

In October 2016, the Government committed to:</p>  <p>  - Complete an evidence-based expert review of international best practice in the area of mental health</p>  <p>  - Establish an oversight committee to oversee the development of a new policy for mental health</p>  <p>  - Direct the Health Service Executive to develop a multi-annual approach to the development of mental health services.</p>  <p>  In October 2017, an Oversight Group was established to work on a refresh of the Vision for Change. The refreshed report is expected to be finalised in quarter 1, 2019 and will emphasise the importance of policy supporting tangible changes in the lives of people using mental health services. </p>  <p>  A main aim of the refresh is to ensure that the main focus is on the needs of service users and wider population &ndash; not on the needs of the mental health system. A major national stakeholder consultation process occurred in 2018 in 5 counties that engaged with over 1000 individuals from community, statutory and voluntary groups. Social inequalities and social exclusion were main themes arising. </p>  <p>  Consultation with the Department of Social Protection and the Homeless Agency was also undertaken. As a result, there will be a chapter in the refreshed policy that will seek to respond to health inequalities. It is my understanding that the final refreshed policy will make recommendations to address the mental health needs of vulnerable groups, including those who find themselves homeless. </p>  <p>  In addition to the work on Vision for Change, budget 2019 provides for an additional &euro;250,000 under New Development funding to support the current service improvement initiative for homeless persons already being progressed in mental health services and in collaboration with Social Inclusion services. </p></reply>

As of Friday 25th January, the position is as set out:</p><p>GLAS:</p><p>The GLAS scheme was fully subscribed following the third and final Tranche, GLAS 3, which closed for applications in December 2016. </p><p>The position for participants under existing GLAS 5 year contracts is as follows: at end December 2018 there were 49,100 active GLAS participants in all three tranches. To date, 44,275 GLAS participants have received their 2018 advance payment and are fully up to date with their payments. </p><p>In relation to outstanding 2018 payments a significant proportion relate to applicants who have not yet fulfilled the requirements for payment. Non-compliances include the non-submission of Commonage Management Plans and Nutrient Management Plans, GLAS 1 and 2 cases where the mandatory GLAS training has not been completed, Low Emission Slurry Spreading and Rare Breeds forms not returned or cases where the GLAS participant has omitted to update the Department on issues crucial to the payment process.</p><p>Sheep Welfare Scheme:</p><p>The table shows the current position with regards to year 2 of the Sheep Welfare Scheme.<table><tr><th>Scheme Year:</th><th>Yr 2 (2018)</th></tr><tr><td>Total Number of applications:</td><td>20,549</td></tr><tr><td>Number of applications withdrawn:</td><td>892</td></tr><tr><td>Number of applications remaining:</td><td>19,657</td></tr><tr><td>Number of eligible applications:</td><td>18,738</td></tr><tr><td>Number of applicants paid:</td><td>18,607 </td></tr></table></p><p>Participants in the scheme are required to submit their Sheep Census return within the specified timeframe for each year of participation in the scheme.  The late or non-submission of applicants' Sheep Census as required under the Scheme terms and conditions is the primary reason for outstanding payments at this stage.</p><p>Knowledge Transfer:</p><p>The Knowledge Transfer (KT) Programme is a three year scheme. The first two years of the Programme have been completed. </p><p>In Year 1 there were approximately 19,100 eligible participants of which approximately 19,000 have been paid a total of &euro;12.5 m. Remaining applications are being cleared on a case by case basis.</p><p>Following the conclusion of year 2 of the KT Programme some 18,700 participants are due a full or partial payment. Payments to farmers in respect of year 2 of the programme commenced in October 2018 in line with the Farmers Charter commitment, with some &euro;9.9 m issuing to some 15,400 farmers. The remaining year 2 participant payments are being processed as a matter of priority and payments are continuing as more farmers meet their commitments to qualify for payment. </p><p>In addition to the farmer payments, facilitator payments of approximately &euro;12.9 m have also issued in respect of year 1 and year 2 combined. The facilitator payment is made once the 25 working day participant pay-over period has elapsed and the Department receives confirmation from the facilitator that the farmer payments have been made via the appropriate procedures.</p><p>Outstanding payments relate, in the main to, the following issues:</p><p>- Changes of herd ownership during the scheme year</p><p>- The submission of a BPS application in  a Herd/Registered Farm Partnership number other than that used to register/participate in the Knowledge Transfer Programme</p><p>- the manual submission of scheme completion information. </p><p>All of the above require significant additional investigation and subsequent manual intervention within the payment system in order to confirm all requirements have been completed and submitted correctly and cleared for payment.</p><p>Beef Data Genomics Programme:</p><p>The Beef Data and Genomics Programme provides for multi-annual payments to farmers for completion of actions which deliver accelerated genetic improvement in the Irish national herd and improvement of its environmental sustainability.</p><p>Payments under the 2018 Programme year for both BDGP I and BDGP II commenced in December 2018.  A total of 24,543 active participants have received payment.  </p><p>Where payment has not issued it is because the participant has not yet been found to be sufficiently compliant with the requirements of the scheme to allow for a payment to issue.  Payments will continue to be made to participants over the coming weeks as they become compliant with the requirements of the Programme.</p></reply>

The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) 406/2009/EC established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020 for these non-ETS sectors. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their levels in 2005. </p><p>For the period to 2030, the recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation sets out binding annual emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will require a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. In addition to the specific target for 2030, the Effort Sharing Regulation also imposes annual emissions ceilings for each Member State over the period 2021-2030. These annual ceilings, therefore, determine the Member State's carbon budget for the period. </p><p>l have recently received a mandate from Government to begin the preparation of a new All of Government Plan to bring about a step change in our climate ambition over the next decade, and beyond. My vision is that this new Plan will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. It will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. </p><p>I am currently working with my officials to develop proposals for the new plan, and I am engaging with my colleagues across Government in this regard. These actions will cover: </p><p>- regulatory framework;</p><p>- adoption of known technologies;</p><p>- addressing market failure;</p><p>- driving change in business models;</p><p>- the public sector leading by example; and</p><p>- engaging with citizens and communities.</p><p>In the context of this ongoing work, I am considering possible approaches to the allocation of sectoral targets within the overall framework of the EU Effort Sharing Regulation. </p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 135,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.</p>  <p>  The aim of the scheme is to deliver a range of energy efficiency measures in a way which represents the best possible use of Exchequer funding, focusing eligibility to those in receipt of certain payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, such as the Fuel Allowance, and limiting each home to one visit for an energy efficiency upgrade. Last year, the scheme was expanded. Subject to survey by SEAI and assessment of potential for improved energy performance, the scheme can, in certain circumstances, include internal or external wall insulation. This will permit the upgrade of more property types such as homes with solid walls, and also increase the energy savings and emissions reductions that the scheme can achieve and will also enable future fuel switching.</p>  <p>  Demand for the scheme is extremely high, reflecting the shift to deeper measures, and is impacted by longer delivery times associated with these type of works and the delivery capacity of SEAI&rsquo;s contractor panel. The construction market is currently under pressure to deliver new homes as well. </p>  <p>  The measures offered under the scheme are currently being reviewed again in light of new Building Regulations coming into force later this year. Any works carried out under the scheme will need to comply with the requirements set out under those regulations, while also taking account of the budget available to the scheme.</p>  <p>  While homes that previously received works under the scheme are not currently eligible for a second visit, consideration will be given to revisiting these properties later in 2019, where feasible and appropriate.</p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations.</p>  <p>  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the coverage deficits across the country. An Implementation Group is overseeing the implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. The Implementation Group meets on a quarterly basis and publishes quarterly progress reports on the implementation status of actions. </p>  <p>  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 published in February 2018, comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce. Of the 40 actions, 29 had been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the inaugural National Stakeholder Forum 2017, an additional 23 new measures were identified for delivery in 2018. </p>  <p>  The outcome of discussions at the second Annual National Stakeholder Forum held in October 2018 informed preparation of the 2018 Annual Review report, which will be published in Q1 2019 together with the 2019 Work Programme.</p>  <p>  With respect to identifying local blackspots, both the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Rural and Community Development worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This includes blackspots identified by Tipperary County Council under this action.</p>  <p>  Various other initiatives are underway which will address blackspots around the country:</p>  <p>  - Both Departments have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.</p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots. It will also inform future policy within the Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.</p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.</p>  <p>  - ComReg is delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them. </p>  <p>  - ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas, including in County Tipperary.</p></reply>

Illegal dumping is first and foremost a matter of individual responsibility and compliance with the law. While enforcement action in this area is a matter for local authorities, my Department encourages a multi-facetted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education and, as such, provides funding to support the activities of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities of approximately &euro;1 million per annum and of the network of local authority waste enforcement officers of approximately &euro;7.4 million per annum.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has developed the Anti-Dumping Initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations. Since 2017 funding of &euro;3.3 million has been made available from the Environment Fund in this regard which has supported over 400 projects across all 31 local authority areas, remediating black spots and equipping local authority enforcement officers with the latest technologies available to support SMART enforcement of our waste laws.</p>  <p>  A review of this initiative has been undertaken to inform a 2019 anti-dumping work programme and the criteria for the selection of projects will be communicated to local authorities shortly.</p></reply>

Registration is also required for drones with a mass of less than 1 kg where the operator wishes to fly at or above 15 metres above the ground (or water). When a drone is registered, there are restrictions where it may be flown, and it is limited to an operating height of not more than 120 metres above the ground (or water), unless specifically permitted by the IAA. There are also restrictions on flying drones near people, buildings and vehicles.  To date, over 10,000 drones have been registered with the IAA.</p>  <p>  The national rules also set the requirements for drone operations in the vicinity of aerodromes.  For aerodromes within controlled airspace - such as Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Ireland West at Knock - drones are prohibited entirely, except as permitted by the IAA.  For aerodromes in uncontrolled airspace, a drone may not be operated within 5km during periods of aircraft operations, again unless the aerodrome operator or the IAA has given permission.</p>  <p>  With regard to the new EU Regulation, I can advise the Deputy that the first set of detailed implementing rules for the operation of drones are currently being developed by the European Commission.  Until these new pan-European rules are released, the Irish Aviation Authority will continue to apply the existing national regulatory requirements in accordance with S.I. 563 of 2015 for the registration and operation of drones.</p></reply>

The OPW is engaging with the relevant stakeholders to ensure that the additional infrastructure to carry out any necessary import controls becomes operational in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  There are no sanitary and phytosanitary checks carried out in the Port of Cork. The port is, however, approved to handle bulk shipments of wood and plant-based derivatives at the current container terminal in Tivoli and has been engaging with DAFM in respect of its existing third country trade (bulk wood products).</p>  <p>  Port of Cork has identified the need for a BIP (Border Inspection Post) in their plans as part of a new &euro;86 million container terminal in Ringaskiddy and the Port has engaged with both Customs and the DAFM on this matter.

The NAP committed to introduce a risk-based approach to ensure Ireland has a robust and efficient aviation security system.</p>  <p>  The new enhanced staff screening procedures that the Deputy raises were decided by my Department and adopted by the National Civil Aviation Security Committee (NCASC) on the basis of a risk assessment by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), which has responsibility for overseeing compliance with aviation security requirements in Ireland. The NCASC has members taken from key Government Departments, the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, and industry (both airports and airlines).  A number of reviews/audits of security practices and procedures at the State airports pointed to the need to introduce improvements in staff screening arrangements. In particular, in 2017 the Department invited the Paris-based, intergovernmental European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) to review security at Dublin Airport.  A number of recommendations were made, including relating to improving security screening and checks for insider threats. The Department and the IAA have set about implementing these nationally as part of the National Civil Aviation Security Programme.</p>  <p>  On 1 June 2018 my Department issued notice of the new screening procedures, and work has been ongoing at the airports in preparation for the introduction of the new procedures, which take effect from 30 January 2019. What this means in practice is that affected staff will no longer have unchecked access to the designated secure areas of the airport; rather they will have to undergo security checks.  It will be a quick and streamlined process, with special facilities provided.  I wish to assure the Deputy that it has been made quite clear to all of those involved that personnel will continue to be exempt from security screening if they are responding to any emergency situation.  The Department has been in regular communications with the Revenue Commissioners' management, airport management and the Airport Police, and a lot of work has been undertaken at all of the airports to develop and communicate the procedures and protocols that will now be put into effect. The introduction of these new measures will improve security practices and security culture at our airports, which is in everyone&rsquo;s best interests.</p>  <p>  The audit in January 2019 to which the Deputy refers was an inspection of the IAA by the European Commission, and part of this inspection was conducted at Dublin Airport.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area, including the development of BusConnects and MetroLink.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, extensive public consultations are taking place with regard to both projects.</p>  <p>  In relation to proposals to develop new bus lanes as part of the BusConnects programme, any property owner whose property is impacted by the development of the new bus lanes is offered a one-to-one meeting by the NTA and I would encourage any such property owner to meet with the NTA to discuss the proposals and their implications.  In addition to that personalised consultation with individual property owners, the NTA publishes detailed booklets in relation to each proposed "corridor", establishes a community forum for each corridor and holds public information events in relation to the various corridors. The Deputy will, I am sure, acknowledge the extensive scope of this non-statutory consultation process.</p>  <p>  In relation to MetroLink, I understand the NTA is finalising its review of the thousands of submissions received as part of last year's extensive public consultation process and will in the coming months re-engage with the public on a fresh round of public consultation on what will be referred to as the "Preferred Route". That will be a further opportunity for people to review and consider proposals and engage with the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) during that public consultation process.</p>  <p>  I note the Deputy's comments with regard to Mobhi Road and would refer to my comments above in relation to MetroLink and its impending consultation period and note that consultations on BusConnects proposals which may impact that area will commence in mid-February.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the processes I have referred to above provide ample opportunity for people to understand the impications of any proposals and I would encourage as many people as possible to engage with these extensive consultation procesess on these two potentially transformative public transport initiatives.</p></reply>

This framework requires cross agency collaboration and encompasses multiple state agencies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Road Safety Authority, The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority.</p>  <p>  The licensing of large public service vehicles is governed by multiple pieces of legislation including the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, the Road Traffic and Transport Act 2006, the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012 and the Road Traffic Act 1961.</p>  <p>  I have no plans at present to bring forward a Large Public Services Vehicle Bill.

By that deadline, a record 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding.  </p>  <p>  186 of these applications were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January.  </p>  <p>  For the first time, applicants who have submitted incorrect documentation under this round will be given the opportunity to correct their application during the assessment period. While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed. Accordingly, I expect that it will be at least the second quarter of this year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the programme are announced.</p></reply>

Instead the Strategy proposed an enhanced bus service along the corridor and the development of a bus hub in Navan.  In this regard, Bus &Eacute;ireann introduced a new service on the N2 Corridor in late 2017.  Furthermore, Meath County Council, in collaboration with the NTA, is currently progressing the development of a bus hub as provided for by the Transport Strategy. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the Transport Strategy clearly states that the issue of a rail link to Navan should be kept under review and that the corridor previously identified for a Navan rail link should be protected from development.  This issue remains under review and will be considered again as part of the statutory review of the current Strategy which must be reviewed every 6 years following publication. </p>  <p>  In light of their statutory responsibilites on the matter I have therefore forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.

The registration of school-age childcare services is also necessary given the restriction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme to services that are registered with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Initial regulations will come into force on 18th February, enabling services to register in time to take part in the Affordable Childcare Scheme when it opens later this year.</p>  <p>  The primary focus of the initial regulations is that school age childcare services are registered with Tusla.  The regulations also specify requirements on Garda vetting of staff, insurance, access to outdoor space, and the maintenance of policies and procedures on child safeguarding, fire safety, complaints, administration of medication, dropping off and collection of children, and other key policies.</p>  <p>  The requirements being introduced include a minimum ratio of 1 adult to 12 children.  The 1:12 ratio was determined following the advice of the School Age Childcare Standards Working Group, which submitted draft proposals on quality standards for school-age childcare to my Department in 2018.  Membership of the Standards Working Group included organisations that represent full-day care providers, parents, primary schools, children&rsquo;s rights and regulators, as well as organisations focused on the quality of school-age childcare.  In developing their proposals, the Working Group reviewed international evidence and practice, in which there is considerable variation in ratio requirements.  The School Age Childcare Standards Working Group was reconvened for a meeting with officials from my Department in September 2018, during drafting of the School-Age Childcare Regulations, for consultation specifically on the adult-child ratio and outdoor space requirements.</p>  <p>  The Standards Working Group recommended a ratio of 1:11.  The previous working group to examine the issue, which issued the report 'Developing School Age Childcare' in 2005, under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, recommended a 1:8 ratio at that point in time.  A higher ratio of 1:12 has been adopted for the Regulations, reflecting the fact that the age-group is on average higher than that in the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, for which a 1:11 ratio is required. </p>  <p>  School-age childcare services cater for children of very varied ages, from 4 to 14 years of age, though data from Pobal's Early Years Sector Profile suggests that the majority of children attending school-age childcare are less than 8 years old. </p>  <p>  Comparison with the pupil-teacher ratio in schools must take into account the fact that the classroom environment in a school is very different from a childcare setting, and that school-age childcare services are not provided by the State.  Similarly, the National Youth Council of Ireland, in its 2015 publication 'Working Safely in a Youth Club', recommends a ratio in youth clubs - which may cater for young people of school-going age - of 1 adult to 8 young people.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, school-age childcare can involve full-day participation (during holiday periods) of up to 10 hours.  For a similar reason, whereas the ratio for sessional care for 3-5 year olds is 1:11, the ratio for full-day care for the same age-group is 1:8. </p>  <p>  The regulations come into force on 18th February.  Existing services will have either 6 or 3 months in which to apply for registration with Tusla, depending on whether or not they are also registered pre-school services.  The 1:12 ratio as required in the regulations will apply to all school age childcare services.  The 3-6 month period for registration is intended to allow existing providers time to prepare.  Acknowledging that some services may require time to adjust to the new ratio requirement, officials in my Department are currently and expediently examining the matter of commencement of the ratio requirement and will issue a further communication very shortly.</p>  <p>  The regulations coming into force in February are initial regulations, and a public consultation process is planned for 2019 on the development of more comprehensive regulations.</p></reply>

The Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook outlines that, in circumstances where a parent/carer has a disability, it is likely that there may be a number of professionals from different services involved.  It is important that these professionals work together when enquiries and assessments are being conducted, to identify any links between the parent&rsquo;s disability and the impact on the child.  Any assessment should include an understanding of the needs of the family and individual children.</p>  <p>  Legal representation is provided by the Legal Aid Board to parents who meet the eligibility criteria, and this includes parents with disabilities.  Advocacy services are also provided by voluntary agencies, such as the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities, to parents with disabilities whose children are the subject of a court order.</p>  <p>  The national approach to practice, 'Signs of Safety', highlights the importance of considering complicating factors including parental disability in a child&rsquo;s life when a child protection concern is raised.  Professionals involved must consider the impact of parental disability on the child and plan accordingly.  Communication with parents is a key factor in the 'Signs of Safety' framework. Working together to ensure that parents are clearly aware of concerns regarding their child&rsquo;s safety and contributing to plans to address those concerns is a cornerstone of this approach.</p></reply>

The legislation supporting the scheme, the Childcare Support Act 2018, was the subject of much discussion in the Houses and many elements of the policy were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children on a number of occasions.  A Regulatory Impact Analysis was conducted as part of the ACS development.</p><p>The Affordable Childcare Scheme, when introduced, will represent a major landmark for all children and families in Ireland, and especially for lower income families and lone parents.  It may be accessed by all<i></i>families and not just those working or studying full time.  International reports have stated that ACS will significantly address affordability for lower income families and, for example, Ireland will change from being the most expensive country in the OECD for childcare for lone parents, to 11th position.  This will have strong benefits to the community childcare sector.</p><p>Community Childcare settings provide a valuable service to children and families across the country.  These services often provide vital childcare and support to vulnerable families in areas of disadvantage.  In the last 4 years, the DCYA has increased funding for early learning and care and school age childcare by 117%.  A significant proportion of this funding has been targeted at families who use community childcare services, thus assisting with sustainability issues expressed in recent years.  The ACS will further increase investment in childcare and will reduce the top-up many parents have to pay for their childcare, with many benefits accruing for services, one of which is to lessen bad debt experienced by community providers, an issue raised by them with the DCYA in recent years.  The ACS is also expected to increase demand for services thus ensuring that community services can operate at full capacity with efficiencies ensuing.</p><p>Any community service which is currently experiencing sustainability challenges, or, which fears the impact of the introduction of the ACS, should contact its local Childcare Committee or Pobal immediately.  A number of supports are available to them.  Pobal and the 30 local Childcare Committees will provide expert non-financial assistance and support in the first instance to identify root cause and ways to address this.  Additionally, &euro;1.7m has been allocated for targeted sustainability purposes in 2019. </p><p>As well as the analysis already completed and the sustainability features already built in to the ACS, work is ongoing to assess any potential negative impact of the introduction of the ACS on those community services which currently provide the community childcare subvention programme.  As stated above, the Department is actively urging services that believe they are at risk to make themselves known so that available support measures can be put in place.</p><p>There are currently no plans to further report on the matter.</p></reply>

This level of funding facilitated the attendance of c. 119,000 children in the ECCE pre-school programme.  In 2019, &euro;298.1m has been allocated for the ECCE scheme based on an anticipated c. 109,000 children registering with ECCE providers. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that a number of policy changes to the ECCE scheme were instituted in September 2018 (effective for the academic year 2018/19), including the transition from multiple ECCE intakes in the academic year to a single intake occurring in September.  In addition, the minimum age of qualification for ECCE was lowered to 2yrs and 8 months; allowing a greater cohort of children to take advantage of the extension of ECCE entitlement to a full two years.</p>  <p>  The budget allocation of 2019 reflects lower take-up, largely accounted for by declining birth rate and partly due to some children who are eligible for ECCE, registering instead with other government childcare schemes.  This sometimes occurs because, at present parents can only register for one early learning and childcare scheme at a time.  If the parent requires part time or full time day care, whereas ECCE covers 3 hours per day only, another scheme may be more attractive and may reduce the co-payment required by parents.  The budget for these schemes has increased in the recent years. </p>  <p>  However, the Affordable Childcare Scheme that is being introduced later this year will allow parents to register for ACS as well as ECCE, ensuring that children who need subsidised early learning and care or school age childcare, above and beyond ECCE hours, can avail of it in a more streamlined manner.</p></reply>

Should the 15 hour entitlement be increased by an additional two hours per day, up to a total of 25 hours per week, the additional cost would be &euro;198.7m in 2019. </p><p>It should also be noted that the hours of subsidy under the Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will be introduced in late 2019, are intended to wrap around a child's participation in ECCE.

However, the impact of this effect has not been fully quantified and has therefore not been taken into account in the costing figures provided within this reply.<table><tr><th>Variables </th><th>Hours p/week </th><th>Cost per annum (based on 2019)</th><th>Effect </th></tr><tr><td>Current entitlement </td><td>15 hours p/week </td><td>&euro;298.1m</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2 hours additional p/week </td><td>17 hours p/week </td><td>&euro;337.8m </td><td>&euro;39.7m increase in funding required </td></tr><tr><td>2 hours additional p/day</td><td>25 hours p/week </td><td>&euro;496.8m</td><td>&euro;198.7m increase in funding required </td></tr></table></p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills is responsible for this legislation and related arrangements.  The redress scheme established under this act has not been extended to any additional institutions since 2005.   </p>  <p>  I understand that when the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was published in 2009 there were a number of calls for the redress scheme to be extended to include additional institutions, including some mother and baby homes.  These calls have been reviewed on a number of occasions by previous Governments with no change in the institutions covered by the scheme. </p>  <p>  In 2016 the Second Interim Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes made a recommendation that the decision to exclude unaccompanied children who were resident in mother and baby homes from the Residential Institutions Redress Act should be re-examined by Government. </p>  <p>  In examining this matter the Government decided it would not be appropriate to consider any such arrangements in advance of the findings and conclusions of the Commission on relevant matters.  When the Commission submits its final reports, its conclusions on all matters regarding the treatment of former residents of Mother and Baby Homes will be taken into careful consideration when determining the State's response.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the Government has agreed to consider supports and services to respond to the identified health and well-being needs of former residents.  In July of last year I established the Collaborative Forum, as a progressive response to the theme of &ldquo;nothing about us without us&rdquo; which emerged from my consultations with former residents of these institutions.  This innovative approach has empowered former residents to actively contribute to the Government's deliberations on matters of concern to them and their families. </p>  <p>  The Forum has recently submitted its first report to me and I will be bringing my recommendations to Government in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware my Department, along with all government departments, was required to deliver substantial savings on all funding programmes in line with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014.  However, my Department sought to ensure front line youth services, particularly those for the most vulnerable young people, were protected as far as possible from the impact of the reduction in funding.  </p>  <p>  In recent years funding for the provision of youth services has been increased on an annual basis.</p>  <p>  The overall budget for the youth sector in 2018 is &euro; 58.9m in current expenditure, an increase of &euro;7m in the youth funding provided in 2016. </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 has provided a further increase of &euro;1.5m in youth funding.</p>  <p>  My Department has commenced a process to identify service development needs for 2019 and to finalise the 2019 youth funding allocations. The primary purpose of this process is to ensure that youth services are sufficiently resourced to meet the needs of young people and particularly those who are at risk of drugs or alcohol misuse, early school leaving, homelessness or who are living in disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  In this regard, officials within my Department are currently processing funding renewal applications on behalf of both national youth organisations and youth projects throughout the country.  Every effort will be made to complete this process as soon as possible and all youth organisations and youth services will be notified of their allocation at the earliest possible date.</p>  <p>  I understand that in 2011 that Ballymun Regional Youth Service and Poppintree Youth received a combined total of &euro;539,104 in youth funding from my Department.  In 2018 these services received youth funding with a combined total of &euro;1,442,794.</p></reply>

Following these discussions Dr. Shannon and I agreed the Action Plan. </p><p>I am pleased to report progress has been made on the recommendations.  While many of the recommendations for Tusla are of an ongoing nature, I sought assurance at the start of this process that the issues identified are kept to the fore across child protection assessments and on-going engagement with vulnerable families.</p><p>The ongoing implementation of 'Signs of Safety' as the national approach to child protection provides an increased level of analysis and judgement, which  will improve consistency in determining appropriate response pathways for children and families, ensuring they receive a proportionate and timely response.</p><p>Joint working between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been enhanced on a number of levels.  In relation to Tusla's engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Joint Working Protocol has been operational since Quarter 1, 2018.  Work has now commenced on the joint auditing of its implementation.</p><p>The Tusla/An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Joint Data Sharing Agreement is expected to be signed off by Tusla's Interim CEO and the Garda Commissioner in Quarter 1, 2019.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established the National Child Protection Unit, which is now operational.  In October 2018, Tusla assigned a senior staff member for secondment to this Unit with specific responsibility for the development of a joint working model.  A draft Specialist Interviewing Protocol is under consultation, with a target launch date end of February 2019.</p><p>Progress has also been made on developing the out of hours social work service.  A single national out of hours number went live on 3rd December 2018 and is available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Out of Hours GP services and the Accident and Emergency service.  This service provides access to an on-call social worker at regional/area level who can go the scene of an incident in specific cases of a serious nature. </p><p>Dr Shannon's findings on the manner in which Section 12 circumstances were managed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prompted me also to request Tusla to commission research into how social workers made decisions when a child came into their custody, following the use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of Section 12.  This research was undertaken by NUI Galway and a final report is expected early this year.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the focus of Dr. Shannon's audit of the application of Section 12 was An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the majority of recommendations focus on improving Garda practice in these situations.  The report also identified key areas for improvement in Tusla practice and the Action Plan I agreed with Dr Shannon specifically addressed these areas.  While not all actions are yet completed, I am confident that the changes that have and are being put in place are bringing about significant improvements.</p><p>I have also established an interdepartmental group to put in place arrangements for cross-agency centres to support children and families who have suffered from child sexual abuse.</p><p>&lsquo;One House' centres are intended to provide services for children and adolescents where there is a concern that sexual abuse may have occurred.  The intention is that the centres will support children who have suffered sexual abuse  while accessing care or health services, and engaging with the criminal justice system.  The 'One House'  will bring together the forensic, protection, health, therapeutic and policing services in a child centred way in order to minimise as far as possible any additional trauma for the child and their family.  The centres should improve the efficiency and effectiveness of child sexual abuse services and develop specialist expertise, skills and knowledge in this complex area, for the benefit of children who have suffered from sexual abuse and their families.</p></reply>

This contribution must be co-funded by the organisations concerned from other sources, for example, from income received from the public use of their facilities and services.  </p><p>CSP eligibility criteria currently preclude supported organisations, including the organisation in question, from using CSP funding to co-fund salaries of employees once they reach 66 years of age.  That said, the internal operations of CSP supported organisations, including general employment issues relating to CSP supported posts, are solely matters for the Boards of those organisations to manage as the respective employers.  Accordingly, supported organisations may continue to employ persons once they reach their 66th birthday, but the funds to do so must come from a non-CSP source. </p><p>My Department will shortly commence a review of the CSP and there are no immediate plans to change any programme criteria pending completion of this review.  The review will help inform decisions on the future shape of the programme, including <i>inter alia </i>programme<i></i>funding arrangements and age related eligibility criteria.  Subject to a successful tender process, I expect a reviewer to be appointed before the end of February.  The review will take six months and should be completed in early Autumn 2019.</p></reply>

However, the intention was only to identify areas of immediate priority for the purposes of the exercise in question, rather than to compile a definitive list of black spots across the country.  </p>  <p>  While the exercise was informative, it was not comprehensive.  Of the thirty one Local Authorities, only seventeen returned data to feed into the exercise.  The majority of Local Authorities did not have the capacity to carry out technical testing. Furthermore, the methods used to collect the data varied. </p>  <p>  Simultaneously, mobile network operators and infrastructure providers were increasing the number of mobile phone sites in service, as well as upgrading existing networks. As a consequence, the data that was collected in 2018 only represented a snapshot in time for certain areas and could not be interpreted as a definitive source of information regarding mobile phone black spots.  Nor would it be a fair reflection of the current situation, as network developments are taking place on an on-going basis. </p>  <p>  ComReg will shortly be publishing a national map of mobile phone coverage for 2G, 3G and 4G services. This map will show the quality of mobile phone coverage across the county and is a key deliverable of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.</p></reply>

However, the intention was only to identify areas of immediate priority for the purposes of the exercise in question, rather than to compile a definitive list of black spots across the country.  </p>  <p>  While the exercise was informative, it was not comprehensive.  Of the thirty one Local Authorities, only seventeen returned data to feed into the exercise.  The majority of Local Authorities did not have the capacity to carry out technical testing. Furthermore, the methods used to collect the data varied. </p>  <p>  Simultaneously, mobile network operators and infrastructure providers were increasing the number of mobile phone sites in service, as well as upgrading existing networks. As a consequence, the data that was collected in 2018 only represented a snapshot in time for certain areas and could not be interpreted as a definitive source of information regarding mobile phone black spots.  Nor would it be a fair reflection of the current situation, as network developments are taking place on an on-going basis. </p>  <p>  ComReg will shortly be publishing a national map of mobile phone coverage for 2G, 3G and 4G services. This map will show the quality of mobile phone coverage across the county and is a key deliverable of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  </p></reply>

Currently 111 credit unions, at 272 locations are participating in the scheme.  </p>  <p>  An Post facilitates the repayment of PMC loans for social welfare recipients who receive their payment through the post office, by utilising the Department's Household Budgeting facility to deduct the repayment amount from the social welfare payment and transmitting it onward to the relevant credit union. For borrowers receiving their weekly social welfare payment electronically into an account, the repayment method is by direct debit or standing order. </p>  <p>  The It Make Sense Loan is funded by the individual credit unions participating in the scheme. Each credit union assesses loan applications in line with the credit policy underpinning the It Makes Sense loan scheme.  If an It Make Sense borrower defaults on loan repayment, the credit union bears the loss in the same way as for any of its other loan products. There is no State guarantee in place.</p>  <p>  The credit policy underpinning the It Makes Sense Loan sets out a number of factors to assist credit unions with the loan decision process, a key factor of which is an assessment of the capacity and willingness of the borrower  to repay.</p>  <p>  In addition, in order to support participating credit unions the PMC project team provides support and training to all credit unions offering the loans and there is a helpdesk in place to assist them with any queries that may arise.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

We have been planning for all Brexit scenarios but in light of uncertainties in London and the Brexit deadline of 29 March, the Government decided at its meeting of 11 December that immediate priority must now be given to preparations for a no deal Brexit and that Government Departments and state agencies should urgently take forward work on that basis.  </p>  <p>  The Contingency Action Plan which the Government published on 19 December sets out in comprehensive terms, the challenges to be faced and the actions taken and planned by the Government across key sectors in the event of a no deal Brexit scenario. </p>  <p>  My key area of interest is the impact of Brexit on the current reciprocal arrangements for social insurance schemes, social assistance schemes and child benefit under the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland.    </p>  <p>  Last year, I met with the then UK Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and we agreed the objective of ensuring that the reciprocity of social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the Common Travel Area, are safeguarded and maintained. Because of the unique nature of the Common Travel Area and the specific rights which it provides and will continue to provide for Irish and British citizens in each other&rsquo;s countries, it is imperative that Ireland and the UK have an agreement to provide for social protection. I intend that the agreement would be signed at technical level shortly </p>  <p>  In addition the General Scheme of the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill which the Government published last week (24 January 2019) is part of a framework of wider planning and preparations for the possibility of a no deal Brexit, which the Government still hopes can be avoided.</p>  <p>  Part 11 of the General Scheme sets out proposed amendments to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2015 (as amended).  These amendments are being introduced in in line with the Government&rsquo;s Brexit priority of maintaining the Common Travel Area.       </p>  <p>  The amendments give the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection powers to make regulations with regard to a number of issues such as: the treatment of events of facts in the UK as they relate to claims and payments; taking account of social insurance contributions for the purposes of determining eligibility for social insurance payments; the avoidance of multiple payments; arrangements regarding frontier workers; and the appropriate the exchange of information with the proper authorities in the UK (in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR).    </p></reply>

These schemes have a very significant social inclusion focus, are well embedded in our local communities nationally and are generally engaged in significant levels of local service support and delivery.</p>  <p>  The RSS and JI are considered to be Social Inclusion placements whereas the CE placements are categorised into two strands, Social Inclusion and Activation.  The Activation placements provide unemployed individuals with work experience, training and development to assist them achieve sustainable employment.  The Social Inclusion placements are more suited to adults who need additional supports e.g. older unemployed workers, persons with a disability, travellers, homeless people, refugees, those requiring drug rehabilitation and ex-offenders.  The expected pace of progression from a social inclusion placements is much lower than that of a participant in an activation placement.</p>  <p>  I sought the agreement of Government to establish an Interdepartmental Group to explore the most appropriate organisation arrangements, including which Department should host the Community Employment Social Inclusion placements including, Drug Rehabilitation and Childcare CE schemes as well as the Rural Social Scheme and the Job Initiative scheme as I believe that we need to establish an appropriate home and structure for these social inclusion placements.   </p>  <p>  I believe that we need to take a wholly inclusive approach for people who participate in CE and to include an appropriate focus on their ongoing contribution to the provision of services in local areas.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s main focus, as a Public Employment Service, has to remain on activation and to progress as many participants as possible from CE into full-time and sustainable employment. It is also my strong view that local services which are supported by these social inclusion placements must be safeguarded into the future. </p></reply>

Many of the provisions contained within the Directive will support positive reform of the Irish occupational pension sector.  The Directive provides for a range of new requirements concerning governance, management standards in schemes, safekeeping of assets, the need for clear and relevant information to members, the removal of obstacles to cross-border provision of pension services and the facilitation of cross border transfer of schemes.  There are also provisions that will enhance the powers of the Pensions Authority for effective supervision of occupational pensions.   </p>  <p>  The IORP II  Directive was the result of almost three years of discussion and negotiation and came into force on 12 January 2017.  Officials in my Department, supported by the Pensions Authority, are managing the transposition process of the IORP II Directive.  This is a substantial Directive and preparation of regulations to transpose the Directive are at an advanced stage.  It is expected that transposition into Irish law will be achieved later this quarter.  This timeframe is in keeping with many other EU countries. </p>  <p>  Codes of practice will be issued by the Pensions Authority following approval of the Minister.  The codes will expand on requirements, policies and principles prescribed in the transposing regulations. They will explain in practical detail what the Authority will expect from trustees to demonstrate their commitment to serving the best interests of members, deferred members and other beneficiaries.  </p>  <p>  To ensure that schemes are informed of their obligations under the Directive, the Pensions Authority will also undertake a communication campaign on the implementation of the Directive.  The Authority will engage and consult with industry stakeholders and trustees on implementation of the new regulatory regime and related codes of practice.  The emphasis of this engagement will be on providing sufficient support, time and information in order for industry and trustees to plan for and make the changes needed.  </p>  <p>  While the Directive allows Member States not to apply some of the provisions to smaller schemes, I believe all schemes should be subject to sound protections for pensions and consumers.  Money saved for pension purposes should be properly protected to ensure that the saver has adequate resources for retirement years.  To exclude small schemes from the provisions of the Directive would be contrary to the policy of enhancing standards for consumers.  </p>  <p>  Article 19 of the Directive sets out the investment rules for occupational pension schemes. The underlying principle for capital investment is for schemes to invest in accordance with the 'prudent person' rule and the other specific rules set out in the Article.  It is recognised that there should be an appropriate level of investment freedom for schemes within prudent limits and this is reflected in the rules.  Assets must be predominantly invested on regulated markets, i.e., at least 50%.  This allows adequate scope for investment in instruments with a long-term economic profile and non-listed undertakings such as property and infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  The application of the Directive is prospective, not retrospective so these changes will not affect existing investments and borrowings by schemes.  From transposition forward, single member schemes will no longer be allowed to enter into new borrowing agreements, except for short term and liquidity purposes, and all future investments will have to be in accordance with the rules in the Directive.   Accordingly, no current investment plans are impacted or jeopardised.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These supports include the JobPath service.  </p><p>JobPath is a service that supports people who are long-term unemployed to obtain and sustain paid employment.  The service was launched in 2015 on a &lsquo;rolling basis&rsquo; with referral numbers gradually increasing over time. Between July 2015 and January 2019 some 205,000 jobseekers had engaged with the service.  </p><p>My Department selects clients for the JobPath service by means of a random selection process and protocols for selection currently preclude the selection of anyone who has already completed 52 weeks with the JobPath service within the previous four months. If, however, at the end of this period the jobseeker has not engaged in other activation supports and services they then become eligible for selection for a second period of activation on the JobPath programme.  </p><p>To date just over 21,000 jobseekers have commenced a second engagement period with the service, having availed of the service previously.  </p><p>Jobseekers referred for a second time will start working with a Personal Advisor, who will review their development during their previous time with the service and together they will prepare a new personal progression plan to build on that progress. The actions and tasks agreed will be based on their previous engagement, with particular focus on the identified barriers, which are preventing the person moving into full time suitable employment. </p><p>Between July 2015 and January 2019 approximately 14,000 Jobseekers had a penalty rate applied to their payment at some point during their engagement period with the JobPath service. </p><p>These are broken down by county in table 1.</p><p>There are currently some 79,000 people engaged with the service, of which 432, or 0.5% have a current penalty rate applied to their payment. This figure is consistent with the overall level of penalty rate applied across all Job Seekers.</p><p>These are broken down by county in table 2.</p><p>JobPath providers do not apply or recommend the application of a penalty rate of payment.  They simply advise my Department if a jobseeker is failing to attend activation meetings.  Officials in my Department then contact the Jobseeker and seek to arrange a meeting to discuss the matter directly with them.  The application of penalty rates is entirely a matter for my Department and officials involved will take all relevant factors into account.</p><p>In the interests of natural justice, a jobseeker who fails to participate in the activation process, whether that is provided directly by the Intreo Service or via a contracted service provider, is given both written and verbal warnings and an opportunity to comply before a reduced rate of payment is applied.  Furthermore, Jobseekers can, through co-operation with the activation service of my Department, benefit from early re-instatement of the full rate of Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p><p>The legislation underpinning the application of reduced rates of payment is provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2010. All decisions on the application of reduced rates of payment are made by Deciding Officers and are based on all the available evidence and the circumstances of each case.  The Jobseeker can appeal the Deciding Officer&rsquo;s decision through the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO). </p><p>Reduced rates are only applied where a job seeker fails to engage as requested, and following at least two warnings, with the Department&rsquo;s employment services. </p><p>To date, some 46,000 jobseekers have commenced employment during their engagement period with JobPath as set out in table 3. </p><p>There are two phases to the Jobpath service.  During the first phase, of 12 months duration, a personal advisor (PA) provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work.  During this phase the PA continues to work with the client for a further period of up to 12 months.  In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months.</p><p>It should be noted that the figures presented in Table 3 are representative of the entire cohort of JobPath clients between July 2015 and January 2019 and all Job starts in the same period. Many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are still in the first phase of the service and will not have had sufficient time with the service to have gained employment. It is expected that this performance will improve as more clients complete their engagement with the service  </p><p>I trust that this clarifies matter for the deputy. </p><p><b>Table 1: People engaged with JobPath since its introduction in 2015</b><table><tr><th>County </th><th>Jobseekers who engaged with Jobpath July 2015 - January 2019</th><th>Jobseekers who had a penalty rate applied during their engagement with JobPath July 2015 - January 2019</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>4765</td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>4659</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>4919</td><td>360</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>18059</td><td>660</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>10645</td><td>470</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>41215</td><td>3400</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>9195</td><td>630</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>6975</td><td>480</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>8331</td><td>640</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>4070</td><td>180</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>4671</td><td>550</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>1962</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>9950</td><td>730</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>4166</td><td>360</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>8777</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>6277</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>4458</td><td>320</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>2719</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>5560</td><td>570</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>1929</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>3198</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>8861</td><td>510</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>7145</td><td>210</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>6860</td><td>580</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>9795</td><td>740</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>6023</td><td>440</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>205184</td><td>14000</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2: Jobseekers currently engaged with JobPath who currently have a penalty rate applied. </b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Currently engaged with JobPath.</th><th>Currently engaged with JobPath with a current Penalty Rate</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>1775</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>1727</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>1845</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>6163</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>4421</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>17370</td><td>186</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>3936</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>2419</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>2829</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1469</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>1817</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>860</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>3525</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>1451</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>3656</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>2802</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>2086</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>1110</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>2016</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>892</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>1350</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>3176</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>2245</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>2557</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>2992</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>2304</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>78793</td><td>432</td></tr></table><i>Please note: Counties marked 'N/A' are those counties where there are 5 penalty rates (or less) currently in place, these are not shown within the table however they are included in the overall total.</i></p><p><b>Table 3: Jobseekers engaged with JobPath who have commenced employment July 2015- January 2019</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Jobseekers engaged with JobPath who have commenced employment July 2015 - January 2019</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>1235</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>934</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>1127</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>4484</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>1739</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>8475</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>1796</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>2436</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>1076</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>1079</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>384</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>2570</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>872</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>1868</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>854</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>800</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>687</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>1349</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>307</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>597</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>2142</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>1816</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>1536</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>2624</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>1341</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>46144</td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-29a.1482.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012900087#WREE01500"><p>Academics from Waterford Institute of Technology recently made statements to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The statements made reference to research undertaken where 121 unemployed persons had been interviewed as part of their research into experiences of unemployment. 25 of those who partook in the research reported an experience of the JobPath programme. It is unclear from the statements made as to the degree to which those interviewed reflect a representative sample of service users upon which the conclusions and recommendations contained are based.</p><p>However, it should be noted that reports to the Committee are at variance with the surveys conducted by the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed (INOU) and contrary to the feedback and findings arising from research carried out by an independent external consultants W5. This research specifically assesses the level of satisfaction with JobPath services across the country. In summary, the W5 surveys conducted in 2016, 2017 and 2018 reflect the views of some 6,000 jobseekers and found that JobPath participants view the service very positively<b>.  </b>On the key aspects of premises, staff, services and processes, reaction is almost uniformly positive<b></b>and at odds with the findings of the authors&rsquo; report. </p><p>All of the evidence available to my Department indicates that the experience of customers who have engaged with the JobPath service to date has been quite positive. In addition the service providers are subject to regular audits and inspections. The Department&rsquo;s contract with the JobPath provider requires them to have a comprehensive Complaints Process and this is advertised in every provider location.  The process contains various levels of escalation, allowing complaints to be dealt with at a level appropriate to the concern.  </p><p>Up to December 2018, approximately 201,972 Jobseekers have engaged with the JobPath service, with only 836 complaints received in total &ndash; 0.41 per cent. The Department has completed 10 reviews of complaints and participants have the option of requesting the Ombudsman to conduct a further review, although to date none have done so.  </p><p>With regard to the issue of penalty rates of payment, jobseeker payments are conditional on jobseekers being genuinely available for work.  The activation and employment support services provided by the Department, at significant expense, are designed to help jobseekers secure employment.  In line with the principle of rights and responsibilities jobseekers are entitled to be provided with these services but are also required to engage with the services when they are made available.  This obligation applies irrespective of whether the service is provided by my Department&rsquo;s own case officers, those employed by the Local Employment Service or by JobPath.  Failure, without good cause, to engage with the services can result in a reduction in the payment to the jobseeker.  However reductions are only applied after the jobseeker has been given due notice on two occasions and an opportunity to provide an explanation for their non-engagement and to re-engage with the services.  All decisions on the application of a reduced rate of payment are made by staff of the Department.</p><p>Where the Jobseeker is dissatisfied with this Decision it is open to that individual to appeal the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office. Should an appeal against a Decision to apply a penalty rate be upheld, the amounts withheld from the jobseeker payment would be refunded to the person concerned.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p><p>It is important to note that people in receipt of a British State pension or an equivalent pension from other EU countries are eligible to receive the fuel allowance payment on the same basis as Irish State pension recipients.  For my Department to determine a person's entitlement to fuel allowance he or she must submit an application form.  My Department has no record of the person concerned submitting an application for fuel allowance. </p><p>The Living Alone Increase is a &euro;9 increase in the weekly rate of payment of certain Irish social protection payments, awarded where the recipient is living alone.  These payments include State pensions, disability allowance, invalidity pension, incapacity supplement and blind pension.  It is not a stand-alone payment.</p><p>People in receipt of the British state pension or equivalent payments from other EU countries, are not entitled to receive the Irish living alone increase to that payment, as the respective rates of those payments to people living alone or with other people, are set by national legislation in those countries. There are no circumstances where the living alone increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment from my Department in the first place.</p><p>Certain people who live in Ireland and receive a UK pension may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory).  This is a means-tested payment for people aged 66 and over, who do not qualify for a State pension contributory, or who only qualify for a reduced rate contributory pension based on their social insurance record.  To be eligible for a State pension (non-contributory), an applicant must:</p><p>- be aged 66 years or over,</p><p>- have a legal right of residence in the State,</p><p>- be habitually resident in the State,</p><p>- have a valid Personal Public Service Number (PPSN),</p><p>- satisfy a means test, and</p><p>- if awarded the pension, continue to satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition and the applicable means test.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Generally these are improvements, at times of inflation and economic growth, but during the economic crisis (and the very significant price deflation at that time), there were reductions in a wide range of payments, which were necessary to manage the very large current budget deficit that the economic turndown created.  More recent budgets have seen a number of improvements in the rates of payments across a number of schemes, as the economy has recovered, and the government has tried to restore and improve rates as this has become possible, while mindful not to repeat the mistakes which caused the economic crisis in the first place.</p>  <p>  Such increased rates of payment are not backdated to dates before those changes are announced, and applicants receive their payment based on the correct rules that apply at that time.  </p>  <p>  In January last year I announced a new Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to calculating the entitlement of pensioners who reached state pension age from September 2012 (i.e., those born on or after 1 September 1946).   In this announcement, I stated that payments would be due from March 30th 2018 in keeping with other budgetary increases that had also been announced.  However, the practical steps required to implement these new payments, including development of supporting legislation and IT systems, meant that the first payments would be made in the first quarter of 2019, with arrears paid where appropriate.  </p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of reviewing those pensioners in receipt of a contributory state pension below the maximum rate.  Payments are expected to be processed in the coming months and will be backdated to March 30th 2018, or their 66th birthday, whichever is later.  The cost of this change in 2019, including 2018 arrears, is expected to come to something in the region of &euro;54 million, plus inflows from other payments, such as non-contributory pensioners who will now qualify for a higher rate contributory pension.  The precise figure will depend upon a number of factors, including take-up of HomeCaring periods, and also the inflows from other payments, where a person has no existing SPC claim in the system.</p>  <p>  It is more difficult again to give a precise figure for what would be the cost of backdating payments for this change to six years ago, as this would include a number of people who have passed away over the years, and are not, therefore, among current pensioners who are being reviewed.  A tentative estimate would suggest the cost to be in the region of &euro;220m if the new rules were to apply for all who reached state pension age after January 1st 2013.  </p>  <p>  However, aside from the general principles involved in backdating, if there was to be such a measure introduced for pensioners, there would be calls for similar backdating from many other customers who saw reductions in their payments during the recessionary period.  This would make the ultimate cost of such backdating a multiple of its cost in the context of pensions.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In the assessment of earnings, various disregards and tapers are in place to ensure that financial incentives exist to take up employment.  </p>  <p>  Earnings assessed for means testing purposes generally is based on gross earnings before tax but after PRSI contributions, superannuation/PRSA contributions and trade union subscriptions.</p>  <p>  The current entry points to the tax net ensures that employees do not have to pay income tax until earnings reach &euro;16,500 per annum for a single person, &euro;24,750 per annum for a married one-earner couple and a single parent, and &euro;33,300 per annum for a married two-earner couple.  Allowing taxation as a deduction would mean that the social welfare system, in effect, refunds a person's tax liability.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the recently enacted Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Act 2018 implemented the Make Work Pay recommendation to remove the requirement that employment must be of a rehabilitative nature in order to qualify for the Disability Allowance earnings disregards.

The taking in charge of residential estates by local authorities is provided for under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. The taking in charge of residential estates is a reserved function of the elected members. </p><p>Under Section 180 (1) of the Act, the planning authority is obliged to initiate taking in charge procedures where requested by either the developer or by the majority of owners of the dwellings. However, this is subject to the development being completed to the satisfaction of the authority and in accordance with the permission and any conditions. </p><p>The intention of the legislation is that once a residential estate is complete, the planning authority can be requested to take over the roads and footpaths, water services, public lighting and open spaces. However, where work has not been completed to satisfactory standards, there can be a delay in this process as enforcement proceedings including invocation of bonds are progressed. </p><p>My Department launched the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative (NTICI) in April 2016 to trial new approaches and working methods in supporting and accelerating overall national and local action on the taking-in-charge process of housing estates, including estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure (DPI). Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10 million in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals. Ultimately, &euro;7.5 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 13,400 homes.</p><p>Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process were included in a report on the initiative that my Department published in December 2018. The report can be found at the following link -</p><p>. </p><p>The publication of the NTICI report is of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot authorities, in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking-in-charge, including through coordination with capital works by Irish Water.</p><p>In addition, the National Development Plan includes provision of &euro;31 million for the period 2018-2021 for DPI, demonstrating the Government's commitment to transition from the pilot phase under NTICI to a programme phase.</p><p>My Department is finalising plans for the introduction of this programme phase for taking in charge of developer-provided infrastructure and an announcement will be made in this regard shortly. As indicated above, staffing arrangements in relation to the implementation of this programme in individual local authorities is a matter for the Chief Executive.</p></reply>

Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.  </p>  <p>  Under the cost rental model, minimising retained earnings, land and other delivery costs, while securing very competitive European Investment Bank (EIB) financing, means that affordable rents can be achieved. The final rents, for any given project, will be set after all associated costs are determined, following on from the competitive construction and management tender processes. Cost rental homes will be targeted at households earning low to moderate annual incomes up to a maximum of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants. </p>  <p>  The Government has made &euro;310m available to local authorities to fund facilitating infrastructure to deliver affordable housing from its sites. The funding is available for cost rental projects and can contribute to reducing costs even further.  The terms of any loan funding arrangements put in place for individual projects will be determined on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  Cost rental is new to Ireland and in order to drive delivery, two early mover pilot projects are being advanced, delivering important lessons in terms of cost rental in an Irish setting; one at Enniskerry Road, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and one at Emmet Road in Inchicore.  It is expected that 50 cost rental units and 105 social homes will be made available on the Enniskerry Road site. It is anticipated that the assessment of tenders will be complete and a contract will be awarded by the end of Q1 2019.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the Emmet Road site, while this project is at an earlier stage of development, it is envisaged that the final  tenure-mix, which will be decided by Dublin City Council, will likely include 140 social housing homes, with the remaining 330 homes predominantly provided under cost rental arrangements.  The City Council has appointed a dedicated project manager and a team to drive the project forward and are currently procuring a design for the Urban Design Development Framework Plan which will be completed by end Q1 2019. Thereafter, the Council will procure a multi-disciplinary design team to prepare the project for the planning application stage.</p>  <p>  In addition to pre-existing consultative arrangements, the Council is also facilitating a Consultative Forum specifically for this project. The Council has held three information sessions for the public, community and business representatives. The Consultative Forum has met twice and its third meeting, which I will attend, will take place later today.  I understand the Consultative Forum plan to establish a number of sub-committees to address issues related to, inter alia, education, social regeneration, community facilities and economic development. </p>  <p>  Cost rental will initially be managed on an administrative basis, and my Department is preparing a draft administrative cost rental framework in collaboration with the Housing Agency and the local authorities involved in the pilot projects. The invaluable learning from the above-mentioned projects will inform further cost rental projects to be rolled out across other suitable sites.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) and the new Land Development Agency (LDA) to examine the optimum funding and delivery options to support cost rental delivery at scale.  My Department is also working with the EIB to leverage its advisory and research capacity so that broader international lessons on the operation of cost rental can inform Ireland's approach.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.  Rates income makes an important contribution to meeting the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces. </p><p>While no review of the economic impact of rates on small and medium size enterprises has been carried out by my Department, it should be noted that the national average ARV has not changed significantly in recent years.  It decreased slightly each year from 2010 to 2015 and has increased slightly each year from 2016 to 2018. In addition, local authorities may offer ratepayers assistance or money-in-kind in order to promote the interests of the local community, which includes the economic and general development of the administrative area concerned.  Local authorities also work closely with any ratepayers that may experience difficulty paying rates and facilitate flexible payment options.</p><p>The Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 includes provisions to allow local authorities to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support policy objectives, including, local economic and community plans, development objectives and planning policies.  The Bill has been scheduled for second stage in the D&aacute;il on 30/31 January 2019.</p><p>My Department does not collate data on the number of properties paying rates in individual local authority areas. As regards the value of rates collected nationally, the latest available audited information relates to 2017.  The total value of commercial rates collected, as reported by local authorities in their individual audited financial statements 2011-2017, is set out in the table.  It should be noted that the amounts collected may include arrears.  <table><tr><th>2011&euro; </th><th>2012&euro; </th><th>2013&euro; </th><th>2014&euro; </th><th>2015&euro; </th><th>2016&euro; </th><th>2017&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>1,264,838,715</td><td>1,274,013,442</td><td>1,295,621,403</td><td>1,325,186,430</td><td>1,344,742,056</td><td>1,318,402,246</td><td>1,341,822,316</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In this regard, long term development contribution debtors and deferred income, although matching items, had previously been presented in separate disclosure notes, leading to a false impression that significant long term development contributions were due to local authorities, whereas these only become due for payment when works actually commence.<table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Development Levy Debtors 31/12/2017</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council</td><td>&euro;3,159,011</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council</td><td>&euro;790,130</td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td>&euro;3,584,612</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council</td><td>&euro;3,107,999</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>&euro;10,240,972</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council</td><td>&euro;574,207</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>&euro;40,196,354</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoire/Rathdown County Council</td><td>&euro;19,649,695</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>&euro;84,395,277</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council</td><td>&euro;850,749</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council</td><td>&euro;1,423,176</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>&euro;2,169,169</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council</td><td>&euro;6,421,288</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td>&euro;7,225,494</td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council</td><td>&euro;761,787</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council</td><td>&euro;526,811</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>&euro;4,536,210</td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council</td><td>&euro;3,201,685</td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>&euro;9,791,344</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council</td><td>&euro;7,506,020</td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>&euro;25,019,285</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council</td><td>&euro;2,352,848</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>&euro;2,322,806</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council</td><td>&euro;6,810,737</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council</td><td>&euro;219,436</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council</td><td>&euro;18,780,811</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council</td><td>&euro;5,053,614</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>&euro;1,537,329</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council</td><td>&euro;2,343,702</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council</td><td>&euro;10,964,226</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council</td><td>&euro;7,695,467</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;293,212,251</td></tr></table><b>Source: Audited Annual Financial Statements 2017.</b></p></reply>

In addition, a new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was introduced on 1 February 2018, under which home loans, at affordable, fixed rates over the term of the loan can be made available to credit worthy home purchasers meeting the above income limits. </p>  <p>  In order to support local authorities in delivering affordable homes, &euro;310 million will be made available from 2019 until 2021 under the Serviced Site Fund (SSF). The (SSF) will fund facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites. At a maximum funding rate of &euro;50,000 per affordable home, at least 6,200 will be facilitated in total.</p>  <p>  On foot of a first call for proposals which issued to local authorities in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, Cork and Galway City, approval issued for ten projects costing &euro;43m, which will support 1,400 affordable homes, in December 2018.  Infrastructure works on these projects will begin as soon as possible and delivery of affordable homes are anticipated from early 2020 onwards.  Five other projects submitted are still under active consideration and my Department is working with the local authorities concerned to progress them.</p>  <p>  A second call for proposals will issue shortly. In order to inform that process all local authorities wishing to be considered for funding have been asked to submit economic assessments of the requirement and potential to deliver affordable homes from their sites.  </p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work. It is estimated by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) that rents of between 15-25% below market are achievable. </p>  <p>  There are currently two cost rental projects at Enniskerry Road, in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, Inchicore, which will deliver 50 and 330 cost rental homes, respectively.  The experience on these projects will inform a national cost rental framework under which similar projects will be rolled out on a wider scale. My Department is engaged  with the National Development Finance Agency, the European Investment Bank and the LDA to develop the optimum funding and delivery mechanisms to support cost rental delivery at scale in Dublin and other urban areas.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, a valuation for commercial rates purposes is an estimate of the Net Annual Value (NAV) of a property, at a specified valuation date, on the assumption that the occupier is responsible for the payment of commercial rates and for insuring and maintaining the property. The term &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; has a legal definition and is set out in section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001 as the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes payable in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant.</p>  <p>  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s comments in relation to the approach adopted in Northern Ireland. However, the approach adopted in any jurisdiction will necessarily reflect the underlying legislation, which differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. I understand that the valuation methodology adopted by the Valuation Office for valuing service stations in Ireland is based on an analysis of the market for that class of property in this jurisdiction and in accordance with the provisions of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, as they apply here.</p></reply>

The allocation of such support is a matter for each local authority in accordance with its allocation scheme made under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. Section 22 of the Act requires all local authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme determining the order of priority to be accorded in the allocation of dwellings to households qualified for social housing support and to households approved for a transfer, the allocation of which would, in the opinion of the authority, meet the accommodation needs and requirements of the households.</p><p>Under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2009, I, as Minister, have no function in relation to the assessment of individual housing applications and the allocation of accommodation to eligible households, which are matters solely for local authorities.  It is worth noting that Section 2 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 defines a &ldquo;household&rdquo; as &ldquo;a person who lives alone or 2 or more persons who live together&rdquo;. Children are considered to have a housing need as part of a household.</p><p>Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority area are provided in the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA).  The most recently conducted SSHA, carried out in June 2018, details the number of households on all local authority waiting lists as at 11 June 2018 (the count date) and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link. The SSHA report includes breakdowns by each local authority across a range of categories.</p><p><b>Report 2018</b></p><p><i>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/summary_of_social_housing_assessments_2018_-_key_findings.pdf.</i></p><p>The SSHA has been conducted on an annual basis since 2016, prior to which it was carried out tri-annually.

These summaries were carried out using a standardised methodology as specified by the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011. Previous summaries were not carried out under the current standardised assessment regime for social housing support which came into effect on 1 April 2011.</p><p>It should also be noted that the SSHA is a point in time exercise and does not necessarily reflect the dynamic nature of entry to and exit from the list.</p><p>My Department is currently working with the Housing Agency on the proposed 2019 summary. I expect the results of that summary to be available early in the final quarter of this year.</p></reply>

It is important to note that while my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.  Accordingly,  detailed  information in relation to individual residential complexes is not available in my Department. </p><p>The aim of the building regulations is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. The building regulations apply to the design and construction of a building or to an extension or material alteration of a building - these regulations are kept under constant review and they set out the minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve. These requirements are set out in 12 parts classified as Parts A to M.</p><p>Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) provide technical guidance on how to comply with the building regulations in practical terms. TGD B contains guidance, compliance with which will, prima facie, indicate compliance with Part B. The building regulations are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation. </p><p>Work has been on-going to review TGD B &ndash; Fire Safety (2006) and a new Part B/ TGD B Volume 2 (2017) came into force on 1 July 2017. Volume 2 applies to dwelling houses only. Important revisions in the TGD B Volume 2 include enhanced provision for fire detection and alarm systems in dwelling houses, guidance on fire safety in community dwelling houses, guidance on timber frame construction, including new provisions in respect of timber frame party walls, enhanced provisions in respect of loft conversions, new provisions for galleries in dwelling houses and other general updates. A revised Volume 1, dealing with buildings other than dwellings, is being prepared for public consultation.</p><p>In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management was asked to convene a Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  In its report, the Task Force acknowledges the importance of fire safety in apartment buildings and makes a number of recommendations in this regard and I have tasked the Directorate's Management Board with implementation of the recommendations within its remit, and oversight of the implementation of other recommendations.  The Task Force Report is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/fire_safety_in_ireland_-_report_of_the_fire_safety_task_force.pdf. </i></p><p>Additionally, in response to the building failures that have emerged over the last decade, my Department has advanced a robust and focused Building Control Reform Agenda, including:  </p><p>- Amendments to the Building  Control Regulations; </p><p>- Establishment of a  shared services National Building Control Management Project; and </p><p>- The ongoing development of new legislation through the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill.</p><p>These reforms have already brought, and will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations.  </p></reply>

For example, I understand that a majority of local authorities impose a maximum amount of rent payable under their rent scheme for different property types, while a significant minority do not impose any such maximum rents. </p><p>Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft national differential rents framework for the purposes of section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. Such a framework has as its main aim the harmonisation of local authority rents, including a set of standardised income disregards, whilst retaining the general principle of rents related to household income.  Under section 31, the making and revocation of a rent scheme would become reserved functions, while the charging of rents would remain an executive function.</p><p>This work is now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rent for social housing in place across local authorities. The overall objective is to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable and prioritise those on lowest incomes.  I expect that the review will be completed in the near future.</p></reply>

The Review, available at the following link:<i>,</i>explored the impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.  In addition, new structures and arrangements have been put in place to encourage a greater number of entities to take part in the scheme.</p><p>Increasing the visibility and familiarity of the scheme among borrowers is a critical objective.  One of the issues affecting the operation of the scheme overall is the lack of borrower engagement with their lenders.  Increasing awareness and understanding of the scheme has been a priority and a website - <i>www.mortgagetorent.ie </i>- dedicated to guiding and advising borrowers and those acting on behalf of borrowers has been developed by my Department together with the Housing Agency, with input from the Abhaile Service and the Insolvency Service of Ireland. The website, which went live in June 2018, complements the other improvements that have been made to the scheme following the 2017 Review and is the national portal for information on the MTR scheme.</p><p>My Department and the Housing Agency are working with all stakeholders to ensure that the actions set out in the Review are being effectively implemented to benefit a greater number of households.  A significant borrower, lender, insolvency practitioner and local authority awareness raising and training programme has been initiated and is ongoing.  My Department is continuing to work very closely with the Abhaile Service as well as the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) with a particular focus on reaching out to borrowers in arrears of more than 2 years.</p><p>The Government's focus is to ensure that as many households as possible remain in their homes and I would encourage borrowers to engage with the Abhaile Service, the national mortgage arrears resolution service, provided free of charge to the borrower.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together, for the first time, the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with the borrower and their lender to find the best solution for their particular situation.  MABS acts as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning (076)1072000 or by accessing their website at: <i>www.mabs.ie/abhaile.  </i></p><p>For those borrowers in danger of losing their home who are ineligible for the MTR scheme but qualify for social housing support, it is recommended that they engage as early as possible with their local authority regarding their long-term housing needs.</p></reply>

Article 9(1) of the Directive requires Member States to ensure that by 31 December 2020, all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings.</p>  <p>  The Directive defines a Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) as a building that has a very high energy performance and that the nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby. This definition was incorporated into the Building Regulations in January 2017. </p>  <p>  The NZEB performance requirements are based on the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive cost optimal calculations which were issued in 2013 and 2015. Cost-optimal levels are defined as &ldquo;the energy performance level which leads to the lowest cost during the estimated economic lifecycle". The NZEB performance for new dwellings represents an improvement in energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of 70% over 2005 standards and requires renewables on all new dwellings. This is typically equivalent to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of &ldquo;A2&rdquo; and is recognised internationally as a very advanced performance requirement. The Part L performance requirements of the Building Regulations have been advanced incrementally since 2007 and the final improvement to move from the current standard of 60% better than 2005 standards or a typical BER of &ldquo;A3&rdquo;, to a performance of 70% better than 2005 standards or an &ldquo;A2&rdquo; BER, can be more easily achieved as a result of these incremental improvements.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the draft regulations and accompanying technical guidance to implement this have completed public consultation and the regulations are expected to be signed into law shortly. These regulations will also require that where Major Renovations take place which are greater than 25% of the surface area of the dwelling, the dwelling should achieve a cost optimal performance where feasible. This is equivalent to a B2 building energy rating for a typical dwelling.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers who have access to an adequate deposit and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but who are unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home. </p><p>The Housing Agency assesses applications for loans on behalf of the local authorities. However, the final decision on loan approval is a matter for each local authority and its Credit Committee on a case-by-case basis.  Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the Regulations establishing the scheme; the statutory credit policy issued under the Regulations and have regard to the recommendations of the Housing Agency, in order to ensure consistency of treatment for all applicants.</p><p>Loan applicants who are dissatisfied with a loan application decision of a local authority Credit Committee may appeal that decision to the local authority. Details of the appeals process can be obtained from the relevant local authority.</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is only available for financing a Principal Private Residence (PPR) subject to the following criteria:  </p><p>- For the purpose of purchasing a new, second-hand or self-build property. </p><p>- That the gross internal floor area of the property does not exceed 175 square metres. </p><p>- The property complies with planning and building regulations. </p><p>- The property is located in the Republic of Ireland.</p><p>As with the previous local authority house purchase loan offerings, the properties that may be purchased with a Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan must have a gross internal floor area of 175 square metres or less which is equivalent to 1,884 square feet.  This property size limit more than adequately provides, in terms of property size, for the range of accommodation needs of first time buyers.</p></reply>

The Acts provide that landlords in the sector must apply to register a tenancy of a dwelling with the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) within one month of the commencement of the tenancy. </p><p>The RTB actively pursues landlords for non-registration. Failure of a landlord to register a tenancy with the RTB can result in criminal conviction.  If convicted, a landlord may be liable to fines of up to &euro;4,000 and/or six months' imprisonment, along with a daily fine of &euro;500 for a continuing offence.  In addition, if the tenancy is not registered, the landlord cannot avail of the dispute resolution services of the RTB should an issue arise with the tenancy.</p><p>To pursue non-compliant landlords, the RTB receives information on residential rented dwellings from several sources. Where non-compliance is identified, notice and warning letters are sent to the landlord. If the landlord still fails to register, enforcement action is taken through the courts. </p><p>The RTB's register of tenancies is available and searchable by rental dwelling address on the RTB's website at the following link<i>. </i></p><p>Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) supported tenancies are agreed between the landlord and the tenant; the local authority is not a party to the tenancy and has no role in its agreement. However, as with other private rental tenancies, the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended) governs the relationship between landlord and tenant and the length of the tenancy is a matter that must be agreed between the landlord and tenant in that context. </p><p>The HAP Shared Service Centre (SSC) provides a highly effective transactional service on behalf of Local Authorities, including data-sharing with the RTB in relation to active HAP tenancies. This enables the RTB to ensure compliance with the national tenancy registration system.</p></reply>
