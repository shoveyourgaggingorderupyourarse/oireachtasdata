Temporary re-assignments of resources to meet the challenges of the Covid response has impacted on aspects of this work. </p>  <p>  The PSPC report contains a broad range of recommendations which provided immediate benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) totalling some &euro;10m, as well as initiatives that will lead to further improvements. </p>  <p>  Immediate benefits included a 10% increase in military service allowance; the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain specific Defence Forces allowances; the restoration of premium rates for certain weekend duties and the restoration of a service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots. </p>  <p>  The Report provides for an examination of pay structures in the PDF and the identification of other retention measures, which are due to be progressed within the framework of the Public Service Stability Agreement and future public sector pay negotiations. The Report also contains a range of other recommendations including a review of recruitment methods, enhanced workforce planning, enhanced professional military education, bespoke leadership training, development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy, a review of barriers to extended participation in the PDF, the development of further non-pay retention measures and consideration of the provision of additional specialist posts in certain areas.  </p>  <p>  The scheme which I announced on 1 April last, for the re-enlistment of former personnel with the relevant skills and experience represents one of the recent actions being pursued to address the skill shortages in the PDF. It is a medium to long term initiative which pre-dates the COVID crisis, but will support the Defence Forces in responding to, and sustaining their response to, the current COVID-19 crisis and beyond. </p>  <p>  The scheme allows for initial re-enlistment for a minimum of six months and up to 3 years and I'm pleased to report that there has been a very positive initial response to the scheme for re-enlistment with over 500 expressions of interest. The focus of the scheme is on those former members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) with the skills and expertise to fill specialist vacancies that currently exist in the PDF. These shortages of personnel include a number of specialised posts such as technicians, fitters, chefs, communications and IT specialist, naval and avionics experts. </p>  <p>  Separately, I introduced a scheme for re-commissioning former Officers last October. This scheme facilitates the re-entry of former officers to the Permanent Defence Force and has seen 5 former pilots return to serve in the Air Corps to date. There is also scope to recommission officers in other specialist streams across the Defence Forces and I understand a number of expressions of interest in the scheme have been received recently. </p>  <p>   The PDF continues to offer excellent career opportunities for serving personnel, new entrants and those wishing to re-enter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-13a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051300088#WRB01900"><p>The age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) was an issue of serious concern during the 1990's and was the subject of severe criticism in a series of external reports.  One of the key areas identified for urgent action was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel.  As a result new terms and conditions were introduced for personnel enlisting after 1 January 1994 and new contracts for enlisted personnel were for a period of five years' service.  Since that time, the maximum period of service was extended out to twenty-one years for Privates and Corporals.  </p>  <p>  Arising from an adjudication in 2015, the adjudicator recommended that a review be conducted on the service limits for Privates and Corporals recruited to the Defence Forces post 1 January 1994. This adjudication resulted from a claim from PDFORRA seeking extensions in the service of these personnel to age 50. While the adjudicator did not rule in favour of PDFORRA, he did recommend an extension of service limits for Privates and Corporals in receipt of Tech Pay Group 3 or higher pending completion of the review. </p>  <p>  This recommended review is now being subsumed into a broader review of service limits for all enlisted personnel, as provided for in the White Paper on Defence and more recently in the "Strengthening our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase One&rdquo; high level implementation plan (HLIP). The HLIP provides that consideration be given to options to tackle barriers to extended participation in the PDF, including the possibility of extending retirement ages for members of the PDF. Given the complexities involved it was decided to approach the HLIP project in two phases as follows:</p>  <p>  - Phase 1 &ndash; Review of Mandatory Retirement Ages (MRAs) for Officers </p>  <p>  - Phase 2 - Review Contracts of Service for Enlisted Personnel. </p>  <p>  The review of MRAs for officers is currently on-going, with the review of contracts of service for enlisted personnel due to commence later in 2020.</p>  <p>  Pending completion of the review (of contracts of service for enlisted personnel), the service extension for Privates and Corporals, enlisted post 1 January 1994, has been revised, to the end of December 2022, provided the individual meets certain criteria, including medical grades and fitness tests and does not exceed 50 years of age in that time frame. This measure was agreed with PDFORRA. Following further discussions, it was also agreed that  Sergeants enlisted in the PDF would also be allowed continue in service to the same date, subject to their meeting agreed criteria in the interim period.</p></reply>

Accordingly, there is no pension entitlement. </p>  <p>  The Army Reserve (previously known as An F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il) and the Naval Service Reserve are the component parts of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF).  It is essentially a part-time force in which service is given on an entirely voluntary basis.   Service in the RDF is therefore fundamentally different in nature from service and employment in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF), in particular as regards the respective terms and conditions of service involved.  Thus, the concept of pensionability which applies to service in the PDF would be inappropriate in relation to the RDF. This policy position is of longstanding and there are no proposals to change it. </p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The capital allocation for Defence is &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million on National Development Plan 2019 allocation.  The NDP - Project Ireland 2040 - provides financial allocations for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper underpins the ongoing replacement of the Naval Service fleet. A significant investment over recent years has been on the procurement of new Off-Shore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) for the Naval Service. The fourth ship in the programme, L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, was commissioned into service in May 2019 reflecting an investment by the Government of over &euro;250 million in the new ships programme since 2010. The four ships are performing well in operational service.  </p>  <p>  Along with the L&Eacute; Eithne, the L&Eacute; Ciara was built in 1984, while the L&Eacute; Orla was built in 1985.  Currently the L&Eacute; Orla is in reserve. At the end of 2019 L&Eacute; Ciara underwent a planned annual dry-docking and is again operational.  As a result of the White Paper commitment to vessel replacement, the replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) is the immediate White Paper project in this context.  Projects for other vessel replacement will be considered over the life-time of the White Paper in the context of overall capability development and funding.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

The measure applies across the public service, including the Defence Forces. However, it does not apply in relation to employment with the commercial state bodies or where public service pensioners are employed outside the public service.  </p><p>Pension abatement operates to ensure that pensions payable to public servants do not have the effect of making a pensioner's earnings from their current public service job, plus their existing public service retirement pension, exceed the current equivalent of pensionable salary from their old public service job. The pension payable may be reduced, that is, abated, to stay within the overall limit. The actual impact (if any) from the measure on a person&rsquo;s public service pension will vary from person to person and in some cases there may be no abatement.<s></s></p><p>I should point out that prior to 1 November 2012, this abatement principle / concept already operated as a standard feature of public service pension schemes generally.  However, this was only within individual sectors and bodies where a public service pensioner resumed working in his or her former occupation, e.g. Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Civil Service etc. The 2012 Act extends the principle across and between all public service sectors generally, thereby restoring the arrangements that were in place until 1965.</p><p>I should also state that a public service pensioner already in public service employment<b></b>immediately before 1 November 2012 is not affected by the change while he or she remains in that post/position. However, if their employment status changes after that date, for example, where they secure a new post through promotion with their current public service employer or where they move to a different post or public service body, their pension is subject to abatement in accordance with the legislation. </p><p>The Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) Act 2012 comes under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the question of any changes to that Act would therefore be a matter for him in the first instance.</p></reply>

This includes freedom of expression and assembly, arbitrary arrest, and torture in detention. There are concerns in particular about the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities, political activists, human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists, labour rights activists, artists and environmentalists. Human rights issues therefore continue to constitute an important part of our engagement and dialogue with Iran.</p>  <p>  Discriminatory practices with respect to employment, education and access to other basic services, continue to affect Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; and other minority groups in Iran. The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran has reported on the fact that members of minorities continue to be subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention for engaging in peaceful advocacy for their rights in Iran. Changes to the form for acquiring a national ID card in Iran this year, which have now made it impossible for followers of the Baha'i faith to obtain a new national identification card unless they renounce their religion, is deeply worrying. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to call strongly for the end to the persecution of members of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; faith in Iran, including through bilateral contacts, with our EU partners and at the UN. Ireland has consistently raised the discriminatory treatment of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s in Iran. Most recently, at the 43rd session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland raised concerns regarding the continued discrimination against members of ethnic and religious minorities, in particular those that are not recognised under the Constitution in Iran. Ireland called on Iran to ensure full respect for its international human rights obligations and take all necessary steps to protect the rights of ethnic and religious minorities, and made particular reference to the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community.</p>  <p>  Bilaterally, our concerns are conveyed to the Iranian Embassy on all appropriate occasions. Moreover, in February, during political consultations in Tehran, senior officials from my Department again directly communicated our concerns regarding the human rights situation in Iran. My Department also maintains regular contact with the Irish Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with the EU, will continue to encourage progress in relation to religious minorities in Iran and to make clear our concerns to the Iranian authorities at every appropriate opportunity.</p></reply>

The demonstrators claim that the Act is discriminatory because, unlike other religious groups, Muslims would not benefit from the Act. I understand that the Indian Supreme Court is considering numerous petitions against the Act and that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is seeking to submit an "amicus curiae" brief to the Court.</p>  <p>  The promotion of human rights is a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and Ireland is committed to defending freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities. The European Union aims to engage with India as a strategic partner on a broad range of issues, particularly on human rights. EU Foreign Ministers met with Foreign Minister Jaishankar in Brussels on 17 February for a wide-ranging discussion. During his visit, Minister Jaishankar also met with Members of the European Parliament and he publically defended the Citizenship Amendment Act. The European Union and India were due to hold a Summit meeting on 13 March but, unfortunately, this has been postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in New Delhi will continue to monitor and report on relevant developments, particularly the outcome of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s deliberations. </p></reply>

The vast majority of preparedness work undertaken in 2018 and 2019 remains relevant. The additional time afforded by the Transition Period (to 31 December 2020) enables Departments and Agencies to refine and update this work. </p>  <p>  The ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement in January 2020 ensures that Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, will apply at the end of the transition period  regardless of the outcome of the EU-UK future relationship negotiations.  </p>  <p>  Brexit comes at a time when businesses and the economy are already heavily impacted by the COVID19 crisis.  With less than 7 months to the end of transition, we remain committed to doing everything in our power to ensure that citizens and businesses are as ready as they can be for the end of transition.  The Government acted swiftly and decisively in terms of COVID-related supports to businesses.  Brexit preparation will necessarily be part of a wider business recovery agenda and we will look at how best business supports can be deployed in support of Brexit readiness. </p>  <p>  Significant challenges arise given the UK will leave the Customs Union and Single Market at the end of the transition period.  Even the best possible FTA between the EU and UK will impact supply chains and trade flows and result in checks and controls in both directions on EU-UK trade.   </p>  <p>  Supporting these supply chains and trade flows remains a priority. Significant investment in infrastructure and systems in our ports and airports continues.  The UK landbridge will continue to be of paramount strategic importance to EU operators, especially Irish operators, as a means of accessing the EU Single Market.  We are engaging with our partners in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the Commission to provide a pathway for ensuring the Landbridge remains a viable and efficient option for EU traders.  I have discussed this with Michel Barnier and he understands the importance of safeguarding this important route to market.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s preparedness work will be closely aligned with progress on the negotiations and will evolve as elements of a deal become clearer.  As the talks progress, we will roll out communications programmes covering specific areas.  As before, departments and agencies will continue to meet with key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Last week, I hosted a meeting of the Brexit Stakeholders Forum.  As the Deputy is aware, this forum provides a useful opportunity to hear and exchange views with a range of business and civil society representative groups on how we can collectively ensure that we are well prepared for the range of Brexit scenarios.</p>  <p>  The European Commission is currently updating its 102 readiness notices to provide useful advice to businesses and citizens on how to prepare for Brexit. </p>  <p>  Brexit will mean significant change for our citizens and businesses whatever the outcome of the ongoing EU-UK Future Partnership negotiations, and preparing for this change continues to remain a key area of work across Government.  This work will intensify in the period ahead. We remain committed to doing everything we can to ensure that citizens and businesses are as ready as they can be for the end of transition.</p></reply>

The Protocol will apply from the end of the transition period, whatever the outcome of the negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship.</p>  <p>  The Protocol also contains provisions on a number of important areas for Ireland, including on the rights of individuals, the maintenance of the Common Travel Area, facilitating North South cooperation, and maintaining the Single Electricity Market on the island.</p>  <p>  The Protocol must be operational at the end of the transition period. It is critical, therefore, that the UK Government give a clear roadmap and begin to put practical operational arrangements in place for its implementation. These must be communicated to economic operators in good time.  The European Commission on 30 April published a technical note on some of the practical steps needed to implement the Protocol.  Ireland has advocated early movement on implementation both in bilateral contacts with the UK and in meetings of the EU-UK Joint Committee and in the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.   </p>  <p>  The implementation of the Protocol will mean some changes. Northern Ireland will remain in the UK customs territory but will continue to apply the rules of the Union Customs Code and relevant EU legislation. The Commission has been clear that there will be a need for checks, some of which already exist, on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.  It is important that the implementation of the Protocol works for Northern Ireland, and for the all-island economy, in as smooth a manner as possible.  </p>  <p>  At the EU-UK Joint Committee, which held its first meeting on 30 March, and the Specialised Committee, which met on 30 April, Ireland participated as part of the EU delegation, while representatives of the Northern Ireland Executive formed part of the UK delegation. Discussions took place in a constructive atmosphere. The UK stated at the Joint and Specialised Committees that it will respect all its legal undertakings under the Withdrawal Agreement.  The Specialised Committee took stock of work needed regarding implementation and had an initial discussion on decisions required under the Protocol before the end of transition. Ireland welcomes these important steps.</p>  <p>  Clarity on implementation is particularly important to give reassurance and certainty, and the EU will continue to press for this ahead of the next meetings of the Joint and Specialised Committees. </p>  <p>  Full implementation of what was agreed in the Withdrawal Agreement is fundamental for all EU Member States. A new EU-UK partnership can only be built on the full and effective implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and Protocol.</p></reply>

It is precisely during a time of crisis such as this that all EU Member States should stick to these shared values. </p>  <p>  The first annual Rule of Law Report is one of the major initiatives of the Commission&rsquo;s Work Programme for 2020. It is part of the comprehensive European rule of law mechanism announced in the Political Guidelines of President von der Leyen, and will cover all Member States with objective annual reporting by the European Commission. The Commission&rsquo;s first Report, to be published later this year, will monitor significant developments, both positive and negative, relating to the rule of law in Member States. This rule of law mechanism will act as a preventive tool, deepening dialogue and joint awareness of rule of law issues.</p>  <p>  My Department is closely following developments in Hungary. Ireland along with 18 other EU Member States issued a Joint Statement on the Rule of Law in the context of the Covid-19 crisis on 1 April last. The Statement agreed that emergency measures should be limited to what is strictly necessary, should be proportionate and temporary in nature, subject to regular scrutiny, and respect these principles and international law obligations. Ireland and the other signatories affirmed their support for the European Commission initiative to monitor the emergency measures and their application across Member States to ensure the fundamental values of the Union are upheld.</p>  <p>  At meetings of the General Affairs Councils, which has included hearings on Hungary under the Article 7 (TEU) procedure, Ireland has actively participated in discussions highlighting the importance of respect for the rule of law and fundamental values. </p>  <p>  Most recently, on 22 April last, EU Ministers for European Affairs held an informal video conference to discuss the EU&rsquo;s and the Member States&rsquo; response to the COVID-19 outbreak. They exchanged views on the measures taken so far, at both EU and national levels, and the importance of ensuring such measures are proportionate and respect fundamental rights and the rule of law. </p>  <p>  Measures introduced in Ireland in response to the Covid-19 crisis are temporary and time bound. The measures have been and will remain in accordance with the laws and Constitution of Ireland. Moreover, they are in keeping with the values of the EU.</p></reply>

Over 740,000 predominantly Rohingya refuges now reside in Bangladesh, having fled neighbouring Rakhine State, Myanmar, following the escalation of military operations there in 2017. There are significant numbers of people also displaced internally in Rakhine and the situation remains unstable with ongoing violence generating further displacement of civilians. The situation is also compounded by instances of COVID-19 within vulnerable communities in both Myanmar and Bangladesh (including in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar Town).</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners, has consistently pressed for those responsible for the crimes that precipitated this crisis to be held to account and has engaged in a number of actions at international level in this regard. We are also committed to combatting the humanitarian crisis that has unfolded and to assisting Bangladesh which has shown continued generosity to the Rohingya community in the face of enormous pressure. Ireland has provided direct funding of over &euro;3.6 million to the Rohingya crisis since 2017. A further &euro;1m is due to be contributed to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) response in Bangladesh in 2020.</p>  <p>  I am aware of recent reports of Rohingya people stranded in boats in the Bay of Bengal in appalling conditions. The EU has recently urged Governments in the region to provide rescue operations and assistance to these people. I am aware that Bangladesh has granted safe landing and assistance to a significant number of those concerned and that some have been relocated to Bhasan Char Island. Ireland urges all Governments in the region to provide safe landing, assistance and shelter in safe and sustainable living conditions to these refugees, in coordination with the relevant UN agencies.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to work with our EU and other international partners to press for a long-term sustainable resolution to the Rohingya crisis that will provide a pathway for the safe, sustainable, dignified, and voluntary return of the Rohingya refugees to their places of origin and for ensuring full accountability for the crimes committed against them.</p></reply>

This is a product, which my officials have previously sought information from the Central Bank on.  In response, the Bank has indicated that it is designed to provide consumers with life cover for their whole life.  As long as the policyholder makes regular payments and the payments are sufficient to maintain the chosen benefits, this type of cover will pay a lump sum on the death of the policyholder.  Regular payments into the plan cover the cost of providing the benefits chosen on the plan. In the early years, the payments are higher than the cost of the policyholder&rsquo;s benefits, with the extra money paid going into the plan fund.  However, protection benefits get more expensive as policyholders get older with the result that payments into the plan begin to equal the cost of the chosen benefits.  In the later years of reviewable protection plans, the cost of the benefits increases significantly, and in order to keep the level of benefits at the current level of payments, the difference is made up from the plan fund.  In order to see if the consumer&rsquo;s regular payment plus any fund which has been built up is enough to cover their chosen benefits for their reviewable protection plan, an insurance company carries out regular reviews of these plans. I understand that the period in which these regular reviews are completed can be five, six, ten or twelve years depending on the product.</p><p>During such a review, the insurance company may find that the consumer&rsquo;s current level of payments is enough to maintain the level of cover which the consumer wants.  However, the insurance company may also find that the current level of payments is not enough to maintain the level of cover desired by the consumer, thus explaining why policyholders can find that their premiums are increasing.  I understand it is generally following these reviews, that some people, particularly those that are more elderly, may find that their level of payments are being increased.  This is the nature of this product, and as with any type of insurance product, there is no role for the Department of Finance or the Central Bank in any of these reviews as these are an individual matter for each insurance company and may differ from policy to policy.</p><p>I would however encourage any consumer who is dissatisfied with the service they have received by their insurance provider to issue a formal complaint to give the provider a chance to sort out the problem.  The provider should deal with any complaint through its complaint handling process. This is called an internal dispute resolution process (IDR process).  When the provider&rsquo;s IDR process has been completed, a consumer can then complain to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) if they are not satisfied with its final response.  The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their financial service provider. </p><p>The Deputy will also note that the <i>Financial Services and Pension Ombudsman Act 2017</i>was amended to provide for changes to the six year rule in relation to long-term financial products. This means that a person can now make a complaint to the Ombudsman within any of the following limits:</p><p>- 6 years from the date of the conduct concerned;</p><p>- 3 years from the date on which they became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the conduct concerned; or,</p><p>- Where it appears to the Ombudsman that there are reasonable grounds for a longer period and that it would be just and equitable in the circumstances, the time limit may be extended.  </p><p>Finally, I would note that there is an onus within the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code for companies to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interest of consumers, to act with due care and diligence, and prohibits firms from misleading customer.  The Central Bank expects that when consumers are sold any product, including unit linked whole-of-life insurance, that the risks in that product are fully explained.  When assessing suitability, a regulated entity must ensure that the product or service is consistent with the consumer&rsquo;s attitude to risk.</p><p>In conclusion, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to direct insurance companies, through insurance legislation or otherwise, as to the pricing level for whole-of-life insurance policies, as to do so, would be a breach of the EU and Irish legal framework.</p></reply>

An electric vehicle is one that derives its motive power exclusively from an electric motor. As such, hybrid vehicles do not qualify for this treatment.  The benefit-in-kind exemption applied in respect of an electric car or electric van made available for an employee&rsquo;s private use for the period 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 and applied to both new and used vehicles.</p><p>In Finance Act 2018, I extended this favourable tax treatment until 31 December 2021. However, with some exceptions, a cap of &euro;50,000 now applies on the market value of the electric car that qualifies for the full exemption for the years 2019 - 2021.  In effect, an electric car with a market value in excess of &euro;50,000 is subject to the normal benefit-in-kind regime on the excess amount.  In Finance Act 2019, I further extended this measure to 31 December 2022.</p><p>Benefit-in-kind is applied to 30% of the original market value of a car. The original market value of a car is the price which it might reasonably have been expected to fetch if sold in the State singly in a retail sale in the open market, immediately before the date of its first registration (in the State or elsewhere). In other words, the original market value is the Irish open market price for a single retail sale immediately before the date on which the car was first registered. For a second-hand car, the original market value is the price of the car when purchased new for the first time. </p><p>In the case of an electric car with an original market value in excess of &euro;50,000, the amount subject to benefit-in-kind for the years 2019 &ndash; 2022 is broadly calculated as follows: amount subject to tax = (original market value of the electric car - &euro;50,000) x 30%. </p><p>As is the case for all employer-provided cars, if the annual business kilometres travelled exceed 24,000 kilometres, the 30% may be reduced to 24%, 18%, 12% or 6% depending on the amount of business kilometres travelled.  If the car is only made available for part of the tax year, an adjustment to the business mileage is required for the purposes of determining the appropriate percentage.  Detailed information and worked examples on the taxation of employer-provided electric cars are available on <i></i>.</p><p>For the period of the Covid-19 crisis, some concessions in relation to the application of benefit-in-kind to employer-provided vehicles apply as follows:</p><p><b>(a) Employer Takes Back Possession of the Vehicle</b></p><p>Where an employer takes back possession of the vehicle and an employee has no access to the vehicle, no benefit-in-kind shall apply for the period.</p><p><b>(b) Employer Prohibits Use</b></p><p>Where an employee retains possession of a vehicle, but the employer prohibits the use of the vehicle, no benefit-in-kind shall apply if the vehicle is not used for private use. Records should be maintained to show that the employer has prohibited its use and no such use has occurred, for example  communication from employer, photographic evidence of odometer etc. </p><p><b>(c) Employer Allows Private Use </b></p><p>Where an employee has a car provided by his or her employer and </p><p>- the circumstances in the previous example don&rsquo;t apply</p><p>- limited or reduced business mileage (if any) is undertaken during the period of the COVID-19 crisis</p><p>and</p><p>- personal use is limited</p><p>the amount of business mileage travelled in January 2020 may be used as a base month for the purposes of calculating the amount of benefit-in-kind due. Thus, the percentage applied in the calculation of the cash equivalent, which is based on annualised business mileage, may have regard to the actual business mileage for January 2020, for the period of the COVID-19 restrictions. Appropriate records should be kept, for example business mileage travelled in January, amount of private use, photographic evidence of odometer etc.</p><p><b>Employee Continues Working</b></p><p>Where an employee continues to undertake business travel as usual in an employer-provided vehicle, the usual benefit-in-kind rules will apply. </p></reply>

This relief was introduced in Finance Act 1985 to encourage landowners to lease out land on a long-term basis to active farmers, thereby encouraging more productive use of the land.  Subject to an upper limit, individuals who qualify for the relief are entitled to take a deduction in determining their total income for income tax purposes.   </p>  <p>  To qualify for this relief, a number of conditions must be met. One of these conditions is that there is a lease of &ldquo;land in the State wholly or mainly occupied for the purposes of husbandry and includes a building (other than a building or part of a building used as a dwelling) situated on the land and used for the purposes of farming that land&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  In this context, husbandry includes normal farming, market gardening, horse breeding, cattle dealing, fruit growing and any other form of husbandry, intensive or otherwise, which involves the use of the land or its produce. Therefore, if a farmer leases out a farm building to another farmer and the building is used for the purpose of husbandry, which would include the housing of farm animal stock, then the farmer will  be entitled to the leasing exemption. This is assuming that all other conditions are met. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that they have published a Tax &amp;amp; Duty Manual (Part 23-01-23) which sets out all of the relevant conditions of the relief and may be of assistance.</p></reply>

The package of business supports is now worth &euro;1 billion in liquidity measures. The measures were developed to meet the varying needs of Irish enterprise and they are very specifically targeted by size, sector and need.</p><p>The key measures I announced are set out as follows.</p><p><b>An expansion of the SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme</b>:</p><p>I announced the SBCI Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme on 11 March and it opened for eligibility applications on 23 March. The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200 m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. Following my announcement on April 8, this scheme is now being expanded to bring the total amount of lending available to &euro;450 million.</p><p><b>An expansion of the Future Growth Loan Scheme:</b></p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years and is operated by the SBCI though participating lenders. We have seen strong demand for the scheme since its launch in April 2019 across all sectors and regions including in exporting businesses and family businesses. On 8 April, I announced a &euro;200 million expansion of this scheme and my Department is now working through the details of a significant expansion to bring this funding to market as soon as possible.</p><p><b>For Microenterprises (under 10 employees) and businesses with over 10 employees:</b></p><p>- I am providing Microfinance Ireland (MFI), which is administering special COVID-19 Loans, with an additional &euro;13m in capital support bringing its total lending capacity up to &euro;20m for the coming period. There is also a substantial reduction in interest rates on these loans from 7.8% to 4.5%. Loans can be made up to &euro;50,000 with no repayments required and no interest charged in the first six months.</p><p>- The <b>&euro;2,500 Trading Online Voucher Scheme</b>for microenterprises is being expanded - an additional &euro;3.3m is being provided to the scheme bringing the total available to &euro;5.6m. The scheme is also being made more flexible - allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one; and allowing subscriptions to low-cost online retailing platform solutions to quickly establish a retailing presence online.</p><p><b>&euro;180m Sustaining Enterprise Fund:</b></p><p>- This is specifically aimed at all firms with 10 or more employees in the manufacturing and international services sectors impacted by COVID-19 that are vulnerable but viable.</p><p>- The Fund will be operated by Enterprise Ireland, providing repayable advances of up to &euro;800,000 as agreed with the EU under new State Aid rules and, together with leveraged lending from the financial markets, should see up to &euro;500m of additional investment in vulnerable but viable firms. These grants will only be repayable if and when a business returns to financial good health.</p><p><b>New &euro;2,500 Business Continuity Voucher:</b></p><p>This Voucher is available through Local Enterprise Offices and is designed for businesses across every sector that employ up to 50 people. It can be used by companies to develop short-term and long-term strategies to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p><b>Business Financial Planning Grant:</b></p><p>Business Financial Planning Grant from Enterprise Ireland to the value of &euro;5,000 to assist companies to develop a Business Sustainment Plan and to engage the services of an approved Financial Consultant</p><p><b>Lean Business Improvement Grant:</b></p><p>A &euro;2,500 LEAN Business Improvement Grant from Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to help companies quickly access expertise to review and optimise operations at a time of crisis and identify the key measures needed to ensure continued viability.</p><p><b>Online Retail Scheme:</b></p><p>A new &euro;2m Online Retail Scheme from Enterprise Ireland will be open to retailers employing over 10 people. The objective of the Scheme is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector with a pre-existing online presence to respond to both the domestic and international consumer demand for a competitive online offer. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme. </p><p>These measures are in addition to the &euro;150m of funding capacity in the Government&rsquo;s Credit Guarantee Scheme.</p><p>On Saturday 2 May , I also announced a further suite of measures to support small, medium and larger business that are negatively impacted by Covid-19 with Minister Paschal Donohoe, T.D., Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and Minister Eoghan Murphy, T.D.,  Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. This package of support followed the publication of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business, which sets out a five-stage plan to ease the Covid-19 restrictions and reopen Ireland&rsquo;s economy and society. The new measures we announced included:</p><p>- A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates/waiver rebate from 2019;</p><p>- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates;</p><p>- The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt; and,</p><p>- A commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall, so that local authorities can continue provide full services to the public.</p><p>In addition to the measures I have recently announced, the full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness. </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU&rsquo;s state aid framework.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s has also added a Covid-19 Supports page to its website, which outlines the available Government supports, which you can find at the link below: .</p></reply>

However, as an energy importer Ireland has benefitted from the steep fall in oil prices since 2014, from approximately $100 in 2014 to $64 in 2019.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, in recent months, there has been considerable volatility in oil prices, largely arising from geopolitical tensions and the uncertainty surrounding the global economic impact of Covid-19. To date in May 2020, the price of Brent crude oil had decreased by around 60 per cent, to c. $29, since May 2019. Oil prices were expected to fall this year and the current levels are broadly in-line with my Department&rsquo;s most recent economic forecasts published in Stability Programme Update 2020. </p>  <p>  Generally speaking, decreases in oil prices should have a positive impact on economy&rsquo;s growth prospects through improving consumer spending power and corporate profitability. All things equal, falling oil prices reduce consumer price inflation resulting in higher real wage growth and higher disposable incomes. My Department is currently forecasting HICP consumer price inflation of -0.6 per cent on the back of falling oil prices and suppressed demand due to Covid-19. Falling oil prices should also result in lower petrol and diesel prices for motoring purposes. However, given the recent developments regarding the spread of coronavirus and the resulting uncertainty surrounding both the domestic and global economy, it is uncertain whether the usual upsides resulting from the fall in oil prices, such as higher consumer spending, will materialise. </p>  <p>  Of course, the decision to increase oil supply could easily be reversed resulting in an increase in oil prices. This in turn could result in negative terms of trade effects, with higher import costs reducing purchasing power and in turn weighing on domestic demand. The terms of trade deterioration can also result in a loss of competitiveness for the economy, particularly relative to those trading partners with less reliance on oil.  </p>  <p>  While the economy faces the greatest challenge since the financial crisis, the prudent economic and fiscal policies implemented over recent years have placed Ireland in a stronger position to weather any shock which may materialise including an oil price shock.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-13a.189.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051300090#WRD03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 68 together.</p><p>As the Deputy will know, we are now in the midst of a severe recession, both globally and domestically. Jobs and our people, have borne the brunt of the unprecedented economic decline. But we can and we will recover. Our economy can grow again next year, employment can grow, unemployment can fall, and our public finances can improve. This is because, as the experience of the last financial crisis and Great Recession shows, our economy and labour market are very resilient and have real underlying strengths that this crisis will not have altered.</p><p>In fact, none of the imbalances that characterised our economy before the last recession &ndash; unsustainable credit growth, borrowing from abroad through a balance of payments deficit &ndash; are evident at present. </p><p>Similarly, the three banks in which the state has a shareholding (AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB) entered this crisis in a good position with strong capital and liquidity positions &ndash; a stark contrast to the previous recession. There are now significant capital and liquidity buffers in place in Irish banks which puts them in a strong position to continue to lend to the economy and to aid the recovery.</p><p>Both myself and my officials have engaged and will continue to engage extensively with the Banking and Payments Federation (BPFI) and the banks directly in relation to supports for personal and business customers affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Officials in the department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation. </p><p>All the banks have continued to evolve and expand the supports they have available and I would expect that this process continues. Consequently given the size of the economic shock and the uncertainty around the short to medium term outlook, management teams across every bank in Europe are withdrawing previously issued guidance on earnings for the year and setting out new plans. Our banks are no different.</p><p>In regard to the value of the State's shareholdings, we have obviously seen a large drop as share prices everywhere have fallen. However it should also be noted that Irish bank share prices have been under-performing for at least 18 months i.e. before the onset of the current COVID-19 health and economic crisis. </p><p>It is therefore clear that in these challenging times, recovering all of the &euro;29bn that the state invested in the three remaining banks is not realistic in the short term and perhaps not the medium term either. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>AIB </th>       <th>AIB </th>       <th>Bank of Ireland </th>       <th>Bank of Ireland </th>       <th>PTSB </th>       <th>PTSB </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Date </td>       <td>Share Price </td>       <td>Value of Shareholding &euro;M (c. 71% of total shares following IPO) </td>       <td>Share Price </td>       <td>Value of Shareholding &euro;M (C. 14% of total shares) </td>       <td>Share Price </td>       <td>Value of Shareholding &euro;M (c. 75% of total shares) </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>08/05/2020 </td>       <td>1.085 </td>       <td>2094.52 </td>       <td>1.644 </td>       <td>247.28 </td>       <td>0.48 </td>       <td>163.52 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>With regard to the factors influencing the shares since the current crisis began, I have been informed that feedback from investors and analysts identifies a few likely contributing factors:<blockquote>1.  The large state shareholding: Feedback from investors and advisory firms indicates market concern that banks across Europe with a large state shareholding could be subject to political pressures. Therefore there is some correlation between share price performance and state shareholdings. In Ireland's case we have legally binding Relationship Frameworks which ensure that commercial decisions are matters for the board and management of the banks in which we have a shareholding. <br /><br />2.  A low level of trading volumes: in the current turbulent environment investors have a preference for highly liquid stocks that they can trade in and out of rapidly.  </blockquote>These factors likely explain why there is such an apparent lack of correlation between the share price of Irish banks and their strong capital positions relative to their peers around Europe.</p><p>As regards the fall in the Irish and international stock markets more generally, aside from the knock on wealth and confidence effects, it will likely be more difficult and expensive for some companies to raise equity finance in the months ahead. This is why it is so important that our banking system support its customers appropriately so we can all navigate the current crisis successfully. </p></reply>

Both banks made additional large strides in reducing NPEs further last year and continuing on their paths of digital transformation.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy will be aware, the economic landscape has since been transformed and these results no longer reflect the true picture on the ground for the banks and their customers. Bank of Ireland published its Q1 2020 update on 11 May which showed them recording a loss in the quarter and my officials are currently evaluating and analysing all the information released by the bank. AIB will publish its Q1 2020 on 12 May.</p>  <p>  Clearly there are tough times ahead for both the banks and particularly their customers but fortunately the banks are in strong position in terms of liquidity and capital to weather the storm and support the economy. With bank share prices having dropped dramatically all around Europe, our investments are worth a fraction of what they were worth only 12 to 18 months ago and any plans to sell more of the State's shares in the banks are now on hold.</p></reply>

These rules govern the way public authorities and certain utility operators purchase goods, works and services. The rules are set out in three principal EU Directives which are transposed into national legislation and apply to tenders for public contracts whose monetary value exceeds a certain threshold.

Profits or gains from these activities that were not attributable to a relevant planning decision were taxed in the normal way. Section 31 of Finance Act 2014 repealed the 80% tax rate on these profits or gains with effect from 1 January 2015.</p>  <p>  I have signalled in the past my concerns regarding the re-introduction of a windfall tax. These were on the basis that the re-introduction of a windfall tax on a similar basis is likely to act as a disincentive to landowners to dispose of such property. In addition, the existence of the levy may discourage landowners from seeking planning permission for specific sites. Currently most sales of land or property are subject to CGT at 33 per cent. </p>  <p>  1)  The extent to which any windfall tax may affect land hoarding, land development or indeed residential house prices is likely to be determined by its design, its scale, scope and the rate applied. In the absence of such detail it would be difficult to comment on its potential impact. Indeed if such a tax was introduced it would be some time before it would be possible to consider its effectiveness or impact. </p>  <p>  (1)  As regards capturing any increased land value from rezoning, it is understood that such measures can be a combination of either specific taxes or fees, levies or charges which could be used for specific development purposes. There are also forms of development based land value capture, which aims to capture revenues from the development of the land and return the benefit to state or local authorities. As with any consideration of windfall levies if such or indeed other measures were to be implemented to capture increased land value from rezoning they would need careful analysis in their development, design and implementation. </p>  <p>  It is not clear as to the policy basis a windfall tax would be introduced only for industrial sites identified in Dublin City Council and South Dublin City Counsel. The advice of the Attorney General on the constitutionality of a windfall tax based on geographic location would be necessary.</p>  <p>  (1)  The introduction of any tax changes by themselves such as a windfall tax would not be the solution to resolving issues with the housing market and the supply of new homes. There is significant past experience, which suggests that tax changes by themselves have the potential to create distortions, create perverse incentives and may not lead to a desired outcome of increasing the supply of residential property. </p>  <p>  Finally I would point to the operation of the Land Development Agency (LDA). One of the key aims of the agency is to drive strategic land assembly for the long-term by introducing new mechanisms for working with both public and private sector land owners, by stabilizing land values, flattening extreme peaks and troughs and driving increased affordability through better land availability. The LDA will, in effect, be the State&rsquo;s tool for actively managing development land.</p></reply>

Regulated entities will now make available a further three-month extension to the current payment moratoria to customers that continue to be directly impacted by the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. I have been advised by the Central Bank of Ireland (the Central Bank) that it continues to engage with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) and with firms themselves to ensure the effective implementation of these payment breaks. Credit unions are also supporting requests from their members, on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank expects all regulated entities to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests. Any customer facing potential difficulties in making loan repayments as a result of COVID-19, is advised to contact their bank, credit union or credit servicer as early as possible. The existing protections of the consumer protection framework continue to apply as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection framework seeks to ensure that regulated entities are transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle. Provision 3.1 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the CPC) requires that where a regulated entity has identified that a personal consumer is a vulnerable consumer, the regulated entity must ensure that the vulnerable consumer is provided with such reasonable arrangements and/or assistance that may be necessary to facilitate him or her in his or her dealings with the regulated entity. This includes particular vulnerabilities that may arise as a result of the impact of COVID-19, for example, illness or loss of income.</p>  <p>  Provision 2.6 of the CPC requires that regulated entities must make full disclosure of all relevant material information, including all charges, in a way that seeks to inform the customer. As such, where a payment moratorium is offered in respect of the Covid-19 situation, the Central Bank expects that firms will make clear to the borrower how the moratorium works, the impact of the moratorium on the overall cost of the mortgage and future repayments, as well as how the borrower will be treated when the arrangement ends.</p>  <p>  If a payment moratorium has been mutually agreed between the borrower and the lender, then the loan will not be considered to be in arrears in respect of payments not made over the duration of the agreed payment moratorium.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is acutely aware that dealing with the challenges of COVID-19 will require a co-ordinated effort across the public and private sectors.  First and foremost, COVID-19 is a global public health emergency, so the front line of Ireland&rsquo;s response comprises of the exceptional efforts of Ireland&rsquo;s health professionals.  But it is also clear that COVID-19 is disrupting economic activity, both internationally and in Ireland, with adverse implications for the financial position of households and businesses in the near term.</p>  <p>  In line with the Central Bank's mission to serve the public interest by safeguarding stability and ensuring that the financial system is operating in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy, the Central Bank expects firms to take a consumer-focused approach at this worrying time for some of its customers.</p>  <p>  European Central Bank (ECB) and European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines prescribe the conditions under which a loan is considered to be non-performing for banks. Lenders are also obliged to comply with relevant accounting standards. A number of recent statements from the ECB and the EBA clarifies a number of aspects of the prudential framework to provide clarity to the EU Banking sector.  Where flexibility is provided for within the various obligations, the Central Bank will consider the application of this within the broader European framework. </p>  <p>  The Central Banks has stated that where the Central Credit Register (CCR) is concerned, lenders obligations continue under the Credit Reporting Act 2013 to submit accurate information, and to enquire on the CCR when considering loan applications for &euro;2,000 or more.  Lenders may also enquire on the CCR when considering a loan for less than &euro;2,000; if a borrower has requested a restructure on an existing loan; if there are arrears on an existing loan or if there has been a breach of the limit of a credit card or overdraft.  Borrowers can request their credit report at any time, free of charge (subject to fair usage), at centralcreditregister.ie.</p>  <p>   The CCR produces credit reports for lenders and borrowers on request. The CCR does not produce a credit score; it simply records the information that is submitted by lenders on a monthly basis.  It is factual impartial information. The CCR does not decide if a loan is approved, the lender does.</p>  <p>  Any payment arrangements (including payment breaks agreed between a borrower and their lender) are a matter for discussion between these two parties. Lenders must ensure that they accurately reflect changes to a borrower&rsquo;s repayment terms, in the data submitted to the CCR in accordance with the guidance issued by the Central Bank.  When a lender agrees a payment break with a borrower, the lender should not report this to the CCR as being &ldquo;missed&rdquo; or &ldquo;past due&rdquo; or the loan as being &ldquo;restructured&rdquo; during the period of the payment break.</p>  <p>  Borrowers may also avail of the option to place an explanatory statement on their credit report in connection with any of their information on their credit report.  So for example, if a borrower found themselves in arrears on a loan, they could use this option to explain the circumstances, if they wish.</p></reply>

I have much sympathy for the position such groups find themselves in, however as the Deputy is aware, there are significant constraints on what the Government can do to immediately resolve this issue.  </p><p>In this regard, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have any influence over the pricing of insurance products, and neither can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to community groups, as this is a commercial matter for insurers.  This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, the Government cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.</p><p>Notwithstanding these constraints, insurance reform remains a priority. The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was established in July 2016 and undertook an examination of the factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in order to identify what short, medium and long-term measures could be introduced to help reduce the cost of insurance for consumers, businesses and the voluntary/community and arts sectors.  The CIWG has produced two reports: the <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>and the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance</i>.</p><p>Many reforms have been made already, including amendments to the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004</i>, the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003</i>, and the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank of Ireland.  It is clear however that the single biggest challenge that still needs to be addressed and which is having the most impact on the community group sector is the level of awards that exist in Ireland, for relatively minor injuries, as compared to other jurisdictions.</p><p>I believe the key recommendation arising from both of the CIWG&rsquo;s reports was the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) and the publication of its two reports.  The PIC conducted a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time and this has been very helpful in identifying the scale of the problem that is faced.  This research showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales.  On foot of the PIC recommendations, the Government with the support of all parties in the Oireachtas prioritised the passing of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019</i>.  </p><p>This Act provides that the Judicial Council nominate a date for establishment of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee at its first meeting in accordance with Section 18 of the Judicial Council Act 2019.  At that meeting on 7 February 2020, the Council nominated 28 April 2020 for the establishment of the Committee.  This Committee is tasked with introducing new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, the first meeting of the Committee will take place within one month of establishment and the draft guidelines will be prepared within six months of establishment for submission to the Judicial Council.  It should be noted that adherence to this timeline is a responsibility for the Judicial Council itself and my Department has no role in the matter.  Further, while the Government cannot interfere in the Judicial Council&rsquo;s deliberations due to the constitutional separation of powers, I would hope that the Guidelines will take into account the PIC&rsquo;s benchmarking report, and can come into operation as soon as possible following their submission to the Judicial Council.  In return for lower and more consistent award levels, I believe insurers should significantly reduce their premium levels and broaden their risk horizons.</p><p>In summary, the key outstanding challenge to satisfactorily resolve the cost and availability of insurance issue is a recalibration of award levels downwards.  I believe if this is done and these awards are applied consistently by the courts, the current problems being experienced by impacted community groups and projects, as well as other businesses and organisations more generally, will recede.</p></reply>

This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils.</p>  <p>  Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its concessionary approach broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. </p>  <p>  Following a review by Revenue, who commissioned an expert report, it was concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Revenue engaged with my Department, which subsequently conducted a public consultation. The public consultation ran from 18 April to 24 May 2019 and sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts and the Minister for Health. The results of the consultation were included in the 2019 Tax Strategy Group paper on VAT. </p>  <p>  I subsequently made provision in Finance Bill 2019 to apply the 13.5% rate of VAT to all food supplement products, which took effect from 1 January 2020. Foods for specific groups such as infant follow-on formulae and infant foods, foods for special medical purposes and specially formulated foods (e.g. total diet replacement for weight control) remain zero rated. These are well established and defined categories of food that are essential for vulnerable groups of the population. Fortified foods, such as yoghurts and cereals fortified with vitamins and minerals, will also remain zero rated as they are food.</p>  <p>  Folic acid, vitamin and mineral products for human oral use which are licenced or authorised as medicines by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (&lsquo;HPRA&rsquo;) will remain zero rated under a different VAT provision.</p></reply>

The rate of relief depends on whether the loan was taken out by a first-time buyer, the date of purchase and the length of time the loan has been held. The rate of relief is also subject to a maximum annual cap. MIR was due to cease at the end of 2017 but was extended in Finance Act 2017 to 31 December 2020 on a tapered basis for the remaining recipients of the relief. The effect of the measure was to provide for 75% of the 2017 relief in 2018, 50% in 2019 and 25% in 2020, before expiring on 1 January 2021.  </p>  <p>  The cost of the introduction of a new scheme of MIR would depend on the uptake, as well as the eligibility criteria and rate(s) of relief involved.

This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued. The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.</p>  <p>  The annual cost of such a tax credit, operating on a refundable basis, would depend on the number of those renting, other than those who are in receipt of rental support from the State, and the amount of rent paid by them each year.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that there is no reliable basis available on which to estimate the potential cost of the introduction of a tax relief as described by the Deputy.  However, according to Census 2016 data, the private rented sector amounts to approximately 310,000 units.  This figure includes those in receipt of rental support from the State.

The Technical Note can be found at the following link:</p><p><i></i></p><p>In answering the Deputy&rsquo;s current parliamentary question I have used content included in this note where relevant.</p><p>Under CRD IV rules, deferred tax assets (DTAs), which are substantially made up of tax losses in the case of the Irish banks, are being phased out over a 10-year period which commenced in 2014. Accordingly, tax losses still make up a material portion of the transitional CET1 ratios of the Irish banks. It should be noted that the transitional CET1 ratio is the ratio which the regulator uses when assessing compliance with the minimum ratio set for the bank.</p><p>In the Technical Note referred to above, it was estimated that the removal of DTAs from the banks&rsquo; balance sheets would have the following impact on the December 2017 CET1 ratios as follows:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Transitional CET1 </th>       <th>AIB </th>       <th>BOI </th>       <th>PTSB </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ratio as reported </td>       <td>20.8% </td>       <td>15.8% </td>       <td>17.1% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pro-forma ratios with DTAs removed</td>       <td>17.1% </td>       <td>14.0% </td>       <td>14.8% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Reduction in CET1 ratios </td>       <td>(3.7%) </td>       <td>(1.8%) </td>       <td>(2.3%) </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As fully loaded CET1 ratios are calculated with the DTAs deducted in their entirety from regulatory capital, the removal of DTAs would not impact on the reported ratio in the reporting period in which they were removed. However, for subsequent reporting periods, fully loaded ratios would be negatively impacted as they would not have benefited from the usage of the DTAs in the scenario where the banks continue to be profitable. This also applies beyond the transitional period.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the significant increase in regulatory capital which the banks are now required to hold since the financial crisis. It is not possible to estimate the potential reaction of the regulator should the DTAs be removed from the banks&rsquo; balance sheets in terms of addressing the impact of this on capital. However, as the impact would be significant, with the reported ratios at AIB, BOI and PTSB being reduced by an estimated 18%, 11% and 13% respectively using the same data, it would no doubt be a matter carefully considered.</p><p>In terms of valuation,  it is important to highlight that the DTAs are a valuable asset on a bank&rsquo;s balance sheet and the State benefits from this as it sells down its stakes in the banks. The original Technical Note estimated that the value of the DTAs, under current rules and on a discounted cash flow basis, was c. &euro;2.28bn with the State&rsquo;s share being c. &euro;1.22bn (54%) reflecting its relative shareholdings in the banks.</p><p>As a separate matter,  the removal of DTAs would likely have an impact on the pricing of retail customer products. Although its difficult to estimate the precise impact, one of the key criteria used by banks when pricing products is the return on equity (ROE). ROE is an important metric for a number of stakeholders including the regulator, when assessing the financial performance of a bank. Accordingly, should a bank be required to hold more capital arising from the removal of DTAs, this could put upward pressure on interest rates say, for example, in relation to loan products to ensure the bank is achieving an adequate ROE.</p><p>Finally, during the Committee Stage of Finance Bill 2019, I committed to providing the FinPERT Committee with updated figures on the Technical Note provided in August 2018. Although the figures had changed somewhat allowing for a further year&rsquo;s data, the keys messages from the original Technical Note remain unchanged.</p></reply>

It is clear that the pandemic is disrupting economic activity, both internationally and in Ireland, with adverse impacts on households, businesses and the financial system in the near term. The necessary containment measures on public health grounds will have a significant impact on the euro area and Irish economies. </p><p><b>Monetary policy actions</b></p><p>The European Central Bank has taken a series of monetary policy measures, with the following measures announced at the Governing Council meeting of 12 March 2020:</p><p>1.Additional longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs);</p><p>2.More favourable terms on the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs);</p><p>3.Additional net asset purchases under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP).</p><p>The ECB&rsquo;s response to COVID-19 outbreak was further strengthened on 18 March by:</p><p>1.A new temporary asset purchase programme announced (Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme or PEPP);</p><p>2.Eligible assets under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) broadened to include non-financial commercial paper of sufficient credit quality;</p><p>3.Eligible collateral with respect to refinancing operations expanded to include claims related to the financing of the corporate sector under Additional Credit Claims (ACC). </p><p>The Central Bank recently published an Economic Letter that describes the above monetary policy actions taken to combat the crisis, in particular liquidity policies and asset purchases, and outlines what these measures mean for Ireland</p><p>(See Holton, Phelan and Stuart, 2020, ). </p><p>Further to these measures, on 7 April the Governing Council of the ECB announced a number of temporary collateral easing measures. The goal of these measures is to facilitate the availability of eligible collateral for banks to allow the banks better access to liquidity operations.</p><p>On 30 April, the Governing Council announced further changes to the TLTRO programme with the entry interest rate being lowered to 50 basis points below the average Main Refinancing Operation (MRO) rate over the life of the operation.  The Governing Council also announced a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs). The goals of these operations are to support liquidity conditions in the euro area financial system. </p><p><b>Macroprudential and Supervisory policy actions</b></p><p>European and national policy on capital and liquidity buffers has also been designed to allow banks to withstand stressed situations like the current one. </p><p>On 18 March, the Central Bank of Ireland announced that the Countercyclical Capital Buffer, which had been set at 1 per cent effective from July 2019, would be fully released and reduced to 0 per cent. The release of this time-varying capital buffer is appropriate in the current circumstances in-line with its underlying rationale to support the sustainable flow of credit to the economy in both good times and bad.  This action will support the continued provision of credit to households and business by the banking system during this challenging time.  </p><p>The Supervisory Board of the ECB announced on 12 March that it will allow banks to operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by the Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).</p><p>Banks will also be allowed to partially use capital instruments that do not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, for example Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 instruments, to meet the Pillar 2 Requirements (P2R). This brings forward a measure that was initially scheduled to come into effect in January 2021, as part of the latest revision of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V).</p><p>In subsequent decisions, the Supervisory Board issued a recommendation that banks in the euro area not issue dividends with respect to 2019 or 2020 before October 2020 at the earliest, and there was further capital relief provided with respect to market risk.</p><p>The Central Bank recently published a Financial Stability Note outlining the rationale underlying the release of the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) in Ireland in the light of the recent COVID-19 developments</p><p>(See De Nora, O'Brien and O'Brien, 2020,<i>).</i></p><p>As Minister for Finance, I expect banks to use the positive effects of these measures to support the economy and I know that the Central Bank of Ireland shares this view.  The Central Bank continues to monitor the evolving situation and to assess the impact on the economy and the financial system. Their focus is on ensuring monetary and financial stability and that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy.  The Central Bank is engaged with the financial sector to ensure that firms are responding effectively to the evolving situation.</p></reply>

Investment in support of Regional Development is one of ISIF&rsquo;s priority themes under its refocused strategy &ndash; and within this, investments which can enable the regional cities and major towns are a key focus. ISIF has aligned its strategy with Project Ireland 2040 and its themes of balanced regional growth and compact growth, whereby regional cities and towns will grow within their existing footprint and thereby prevent further urban sprawl.</p>  <p>  The Abbey Quarter development on the former Smithwicks brewery site in Kilkenny is a typical example of ISIF&rsquo;s activities in this area. ISIF has been working in partnership with Kilkenny County Council and is providing commercial investment capital to drive the repurposing of this strategic site at the heart of Kilkenny city. The first office development is currently under construction and is expected to be fully constructed by the end of this year and will provide 47,000 sq. ft. of commercial space with capacity for over 300 workers. </p>  <p>  ISIF has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Port of Cork for the potential repurposing of its Tivoli Docks site, once it has moved its operations to Ringaskiddy. ISIF is also in early stage engagement on other potential opportunities in Limerick, Waterford and Galway.</p>  <p>  ISIF is open to engagement with public and private stakeholders and potential partners on further strategic sites of scale in our regional cities and towns. ISIF&rsquo;s legislative mandate requires each of its investments to seek to generate economic impact and also to be made on fully commercial terms. On this basis any project proposed to ISIF needs to have a robust commercial investment case.</p></reply>

The <i>Stability Programme Update </i>(SPU)<i>2020</i>, published in April and formally submitted to the European Commission and European Council, incorporated the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the adopted policy responses to support households and employees. </p><p>The economic impact of Covid-19 and the implemented support measures mean that tax revenue will be significantly lower and Voted expenditure higher than the position in January. As a result a General Government Deficit of 7.4 per cent of GDP is likely this year. The following table sets out the impact on revenue, expenditure and the General Government Balance (GGB):</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Difference between SPU and MTFS</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tax revenue, &euro; billion</td>       <td>-14.0</td>       <td>-12.3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Voted expenditure, &euro; billion</td>       <td>+8.0</td>       <td>+1.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General government balance, p.p.</td>       <td>-8.1</td>       <td>-5.1</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The projections outlined above are based on the assumption that economic activity bottoms out in the second quarter, with gradual recovery thereafter. In addition, Government will shortly bring forward an economic recovery plan, setting out its approach to repairing the damage caused by the pandemic. The costs of this are not included in the deficit projection outlined above, as decisions have not yet been taken.</p><p>The assumption of gradual economic recovery later this year and into next year should benefit general government revenues, notably through the taxation channel. General government expenditure looks set to fall next year as temporary policy support is unwound. The downward path for interest expenditure will continue, although at a slower pace: while the effective interest rate on public debt continues to decline, the State is carrying a larger burden of debt on foot of the very large deficits this year and next.</p><p>On 2nd May the Government adopted a further suite of measures focused on the business sector. Some of these measures will require legislation to be enacted, which will be a matter for the next Government. The total amount of these additional business support measures is &euro;6.5 billion. </p><p>From a statistical perspective some of these measures will be subject to accrual and others will be financial transactions, therefore the impact on the GGB will differ. The Credit Guarantee Scheme, for example, will be a contingent liability rather than an actual liability. </p><p>Thanks to appropriate budgetary policy over recent years, we meet this challenge from a position of strength &ndash; a budget surplus, cash reserves and the establishment of the<i>Rainy Day Fund. </i></p></reply>

This set out an updated economic and fiscal scenario, for this year and next, incorporating the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The necessary fiscal cost of providing short-term support to the private sector will be significant. A general government deficit of &euro;23 billion is currently projected for this year. </p><p>The cost of these measures was estimated at &euro;6.8 billion, with the most important being the <i>Pandemic Unemployment Payment </i>and the <i>Temporary Wage Subsidy </i>Scheme. These are in place to support those who have lost their employment due to the restrictions and to help maintain the worker-employer relationship. </p><p>On 2 May, the Government adopted an additional suite of measures &ndash; targeted towards the business sector. Some of these measures will require legislation to be enacted, which is a matter for the next Government. The total amount of this additional business support is &euro;6.5 billion. </p><p>From a statistical perspective not all of these measures are included in estimates of the general government balance &ndash; loan guarantees, for example, are contingent liabilities rather than actual liabilities.The Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund, within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), will utilise up to &euro;2 billion of ISIF&rsquo;s readily available capital to invest in medium and large enterprises. </p><p>The starting position is favourable: a general government surplus was delivered last year; the Rainy Day Fund (RDF) was established; at end-April the NTMA had c.&euro;20 billion of cash - pre-funding this year&rsquo;s redemptions; and there are no bonds maturing next year. </p><p>In light of the updated fiscal position, including the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement of &euro;15.6 billion, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has announced a revised bond funding range of &euro;20 billion to &euro;24 billion for the year.</p><p>The NTMA has issued over &euro;11 billion in bonds so far this year. This includes two new bonds maturing in 2027 and 2035. There are further bond auctions scheduled this quarter. The NTMA also plans to increase Treasury Bill and Commercial Paper Issuance. Overall short term issuance is expected to increase by a further &euro;5 billion by year end.</p><p>The first instalment of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) surplus of &euro;2 billion was due to be made this year and had already been accounted for in the Budget 2020 fiscal projections.</p><p>Given the scale of the impact on the economy of Covid-19 it is envisaged that the RDF drawdown, when it happens, will be for the current value of the Fund i.e. &euro;1.5 billion less expenses incurred by the NTMA in managing the Fund. Drawdown of the RDF means that the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for 2020 is c. &euro;1.5 billion less than would otherwise be the case.  The rationale for having such a Fund &ndash; for use in exceptional circumstances such as these &ndash; has been strengthened by this crisis.  </p><p>Due to recent successful debt issuances by the NTMA, there is no immediate need for drawdown and no specific date as to when drawdown will happen. Last month the NTMA successfully borrowed &euro;6 billion in the bond market for 7 year at less than &frac14; of 1 percent.</p><p>The interest rate environment remains accommodative owing to European Central Bank policy action and the introduction of its &euro;750 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme.</p><p>Finally, last week I agreed with my fellow Euro&ndash;area finance Ministers the features and standardised terms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Pandemic Crisis Support instrument. This ESM instrument has been tailored to meet the challenges of this crisis and will make c.&euro;250 billion available to Euro-area Member States.</p><p>Ireland has a strong track record of market access and is well placed to increase its borrowing activity arising from the economic disruption relating to the pandemic.</p></reply>

The background to this decision was a series of meetings with the major insurers where significant concerns were expressed about the early implementation of particular sections of the Act (Sections, 8 and 12), and a general view that they needed a number of months to prepare themselves for the implementation of the other provisions.</p>  <p>  My decision was made on the premise that the majority of the Act could be made operational from an early date after the new Government was formed. This assumption was made on there being a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; approach in the broader economy.  However, circumstances have changed very dramatically with the economic uncertainty caused by Covid-19.  This change of circumstances, in my view, needs to feature in any decision in relation to the commencement of this Act by the new Government.  </p>  <p>  What I can say however is that in my meetings with insurers, they outlined their need for sufficient time in relation to the implementation of Sections 8 (Pre&ndash;contractual duties of consumer and insurer) and Section 12 (Renewal of contract of insurance). You should also note that, Sections 9 (Proportionate remedies for misrepresentation) and 14 (Duties of consumer and insurer at renewal) are sufficiently interrelated with Section 8 that their concerns also apply to these sections.</p>  <p>  In summary, my officials have advised me that the sector has have indicated to them that if insurers are not provided with sufficient time to implement the requirements necessary to fulfil the obligations of the above mentioned sections, insurers may be forced to withdraw certain products from the market in order to prioritise others so as to ensure that they are fully compliant with the law. Such a withdrawal is most likely to impact the employer/public liability part of the market. Consequently, because of the broader uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 virus, and the fact that this matter is one for the next Government and Finance Minister, I cannot currently give any indication of a commencement date generally or for the specific sections referred to above.</p></reply>

The realisation of the surplus depends on the success of NAMA&rsquo;s ongoing deleveraging and the completion of its Dublin Docklands and Poolbeg SDZs and residential funding programmes. </p>  <p>  Following a direction by the Minister for Finance in 2019, NARPS, NAMA&rsquo;s social housing vehicle, will now be retained in long term State ownership. NAMA will transfer NARPS to the State at the direction of the Minister for Finance and this comprises &euro;300 million of the projected &euro;4 billion surplus. Of the remaining &euro;3.7 million, this will begin to transfer to the Exchequer following repayment of NAMA&rsquo;s outstanding equity obligations. It is expected that the first &euro;2 billion of the surplus will be transferred to the exchequer in the coming months. </p>  <p>  In addition to the &euro;2 billion to be transferred in 2020, it is currently estimated that the residual surplus of &euro;1.7bn will be paid to the Exchequer during 2021 and 2022. Forecasts for payments in 2021 and beyond are contingent on the projected surplus of &euro;4 billion remaining unchanged and favourable market conditions that may determine the timing and disposal proceeds of residual assets. It is likely that COVID-19 will have some impact on the timing and amount of forecasted payments beyond 2020 however it is too early to estimate what the overall impact may be.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules at that time. The intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to reduce our national debt and debt servicing costs.</p></reply>

The relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax (currently 20%), where an individual pays qualifying fees for an approved course, whether on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of another individual. Fees which are met from any other source, from a grant or scholarship for example, are not allowable.  In addition, examination fees, administration fees and registration fees do not qualify for relief. </p><p>The maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per course.  &ldquo;Qualifying fees&rdquo; for the purposes of the relief mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course, at an approved college, reduced by the amount of the &quot;student contribution&quot;. The disregarded &quot;student contribution&quot; amount is currently &euro;3,000 in the case of a full-time course and &euro;1,500 in the case of a part-time course, and it applies to all third level courses.  This means the first &euro;3,000 or &euro;1,500, as appropriate, of all fees claimed by an individual taxpayer does not attract tax relief. As a claim may relate to one or more students, generally claimants will get full tax relief on the tuition fees for each of the second and subsequent students in their claim. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer; tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base. I must also take into account that reliefs of this nature should, as far as is practicable, be equal as between different classes of tax-payers. In this regard, teachers receive the same level of relief as other postgraduate students.</p><p>Full details of the relief, including the terms and conditions that apply, are set out on the Revenue website at:</p><p><i></i></p></reply>

Moneylenders should seek to implement alternative repayment methods, if possible, during this time. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland (Central Bank) is responsible for the licensing and supervision of licensed moneylenders under the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (CCA).  I am advised by the Central Bank that there is a strong framework of protection in place for consumers who choose to avail of the services of licensed moneylenders.  The provisions of the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations, 2010 (the CCR) set out certain additional requirements in relation to advertising and the content of relevant documentation (contractual and pre-contractual) to accompany certain credit agreements including moneylending agreements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders (ML Code) also applies to licensed moneylenders engaged in the business of moneylending. </p>  <p>  The relevant statutory and regulatory provisions in relation to advertising by licensed moneylenders are set out in the CCR and the ML Code. Regulation 7 of the CCR sets out that where an advertisement contains a reference to an interest rate or any figure relating to the cost of credit to the consumer that other standard information shall be included in a clear, concise and prominent way by means of a representative example. As set out in the ML Code, licensed moneylenders are required to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of the consumer and the integrity of the market. The ML Code also requires all advertisements to be fair and not misleading. At all times advertising must be in the best interests of consumers and compliant with Codes and Regulations.  The Central Bank is continuing to work towards the publication of the revised ML Code in the form of Statutory Regulations, which it expects to issue shortly.</p>  <p>  In addition to the protections provided under the Central Bank&rsquo;s ML Code, there are also important protections provided for in the relevant legislation whereby licensed moneylenders are prohibited from applying additional charges (other than a collection charge) to a moneylending agreement and are also prohibited from applying any additional charges in the event of a default in the payments due under the agreement (i.e., the total amount repayable by a consumer is limited to the amount specified in the moneylending agreement (the only exception being the awarding of legal costs by a Court of law)).  Licensed moneylenders are also required to undertake a creditworthiness assessment before entering into a moneylending agreement with a consumer.  The Central Bank has previously highlighted its expectation to all credit providers, including licensed moneylenders that they lend responsibly and act in the best interests of consumers.</p>  <p>  Given the potentially increased vulnerability of the consumer base who typically engage with licensed moneylenders and the high cost nature of moneylending loans, the Central Bank expects licensed moneylenders to conduct their activities in a manner which reflects a culture of responsibility at all times. The Central Bank actively communicates to moneylenders in this regard. </p>  <p>  Licensed moneylenders need to be sensitive to changes in consumers&rsquo; circumstances due to the public health measures taken to counter the spread of the COVID-19 virus, which have left many in a financially vulnerable situation.  The Central Bank expects licensed moneylenders to take account of the difficult and challenging situation in which many consumers find themselves and to take a consumer-focused approach in providing reasonable arrangements and/or assistance to support consumers affected by the COVID-19 situation at this difficult time.  Licensed moneylenders who continue to issue loans to consumers must ensure they carry out adequate affordability assessments, particularly taking into account any financial difficulties faced by consumers as a result of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  People experiencing financial difficulties should explore all the options available to them before applying for a loan. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is available to anyone experiencing problems with budgeting and debt. Furthermore, Government has introduced a range of supports to help people where their employment or salary has been impacted by COVID-19, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme.  These measures should also assist those in difficulty and hopefully negate the need to borrow, particularly at high interest rates.   </p>  <p>  Finally, the issue of moneylender interest rates is currently being examined by the Department of Finance. The Department undertook a public consultation in 2019 seeking views on capping the cost of licensed moneylenders and other regulatory matters in relation to moneylending. Analysis of the submissions received during the consultation is being used in framing of policy proposals by my Department.</p></reply>

Urgent action needed to be taken to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions. All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. The levy was successful and did its job as reflected in the increased activity and employment in that sector. The trustees of pension schemes affected by the levy had the option of adjusting current or prospective scheme benefits to take account of the levies, which included the possibility of reducing future retirement benefits.  </p>  <p>  For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, the rate was 0.60% of the pension scheme assets. For the year 2014, the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. Under the legislation, the payment of the levy was treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, were entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It was up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. </p>  <p>  However, the legislation also included safeguards aimed at ensuring that, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it had to be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case could the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.  Where pension scheme trustees or an insurer took the decision to treat the levy as an expense of the pension scheme, they would have adjusted current or prospective benefits payable to members under that scheme. The consequence of this treatment by the trustees or insurer could be a permanent reduction in members' benefits. </p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levies has been used to protect and create jobs and this helped to improve the financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees, etc.) will have since benefitted from tax reductions in the last number of Budgets.</p></reply>

Since then, my Department has kept in contact with the BPFI and certain lenders in relation to the impact of Covid-19, and of course my Department always maintains close and regular contact with the Central Bank on all matters of mutual interest.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the economic difficulties and issues associated with Covid-19 continue to evolve and the recent statement by the BPFI (on 30 April), which stated that the period of loan payment breaks will increase to six months, is testament to this.</p><p>The Central Bank has advised that it continue<s>s</s>to work with lenders to ensure the fair treatment of customers who find themselves in financial difficulties due to the exceptional circumstances of Covid-19.  Payment breaks give borrowers affected by Covid-19 the opportunity to postpone or substantially reduce their repayments at a time of stress.  It is clear that these payment breaks are necessary for many borrowers to enable them to deal with the immediate<s></s>shock that they are experiencing.  The Central Bank expects lenders to clearly explain to their customers the implications of a payment break, for the term, payment schedule and costs of the loan. This includes clarity on how the term of the mortgage will extend, and / or whether the payment break will require increased monthly payments in the future once the break expires. </p><p>Across the European Union, non-performing loans are classified according to a common set of rules under the accounting and banking regulations. Changes to interest charging can, under these rules, result in forbearance implications and in loans becoming classified as in default under distressed restructuring, with consequences for both consumers and banks. The Central Bank has engaged extensively with its counterparts across the EU (in the European Banking Authority and as part of the Single Supervisory Mechanism) to ensure that the non-legislative payment breaks applied in Ireland avoid the classification of exposures under the definition of forbearance or as defaulted under distressed restructuring, where appropriate. In this context, the recently published EBA Guidelines (see )  provide clarity on the treatment of payment moratoria and in particular that payment moratoria do not trigger classification as forbearance or distressed restructuring if the measures taken meet certain conditions. </p><p>As you will be aware, An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys and I met with the Chief Executives of the five Irish major retail banks earlier this week.</p><p>The Taoiseach emphasised the important role of the banking sector in supporting the gradual re-opening of the Irish economy by ensuring a flow of credit to businesses as they begin to trade again, in line with the government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Re-opening Society and Business.</p><p>We welcomed the ongoing work of the banks in helping business customers and mortgage customers impacted by COVID-19, the initial three month payment-breaks, allowing households and businesses to defer some of their most significant outgoings and their intention to extend these payment breaks to six months for households and businesses.</p><p>Finally, we welcomed the commitment by the banks to continue to play their part by working positively with their customers, in as supportive a manner as possible, to ensure that the recovery can take place as quickly as possible.</p><p>We will continue to have ongoing engagement with the Central Bank of Ireland, the BPFI and the retail banks on a wide range of issues as we emerge from this crisis, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Re-opening Society and Business.</p></reply>

The members of the BPFI announced on 30 April, that a further three-month extension to the current payment break will be made available to customers that continue to be directly impacted by the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  However, it is for each financial institution to examine a customer&rsquo;s individual circumstances to make sure the appropriate solution is put in place.  In some cases this will be a mortgage payment break but perhaps if the account is already in arrears, the Central Bank&rsquo;s statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) and its Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, more commonly known as the MARP, may be more appropriate.  </p>  <p>  If the financial institution has deemed that a payment break is not appropriate and that the MARP is more appropriate, the CCMA outlines very clear steps that have to be taken.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  </p>  <p>  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow. It sets out a four-step process that regulated entities must follow.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has emphasised that the provisions of the existing consumer protection framework, which is designed to ensure that consumers&rsquo; best interests are protected, particularly in times of financial difficulties, are in place. People who may be experiencing particular vulnerabilities, as a result of the impact of COVID-19, for example, illness or loss of income, must be provided with whatever reasonable arrangements and/or assistance may be necessary in dealings with regulated entities.</p>  <p>  If the customer is not happy with the way their financial institution is dealing with them, they can make a complaint to them and if they are not satisfied with the response received from them, the customer has the option to bring a complaint to the independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></reply>

This is a very broad category of information and I expect that in many cases disclosures falling into this category are received and dealt with properly without the person making the disclosure or those receiving it ever adverting to the fact that the information constitutes a protected disclosure. </p>  <p>  It is also generally irrelevant to the manner in which such information is dealt with whether the disclosure concerned falls within the legal definition of a protected disclosure, since the obligations which arise in respect of protected disclosures consist principally of not penalising the discloser for making the disclosure and protecting the identity of the person making the disclosure in some circumstances. These obligations would be routinely met without the need for any legal obligation to compel this to occur, so that it is generally not relevant whether the information constitutes a protected disclosure within the meaning of the legislation or not. It is therefore impossible to be certain that no disclosures which fall within the definition of protected disclosures but which have not been formally identified as such have been received and in fact it is very likely that this has occurred.  </p>  <p>  It is for these reasons that it is not possible to provide a comprehensive and exhaustive response to the Deputy's question.  Having said that, it is important to state that the Department of Finance has put in place policy and procedures for the making of Protected Disclosures in the Department, which have been developed in line with the Protected Disclosures Act, 2014 and agreed by the Department&rsquo;s Executive Board. This sets out the process by which a &lsquo;worker&rsquo; of the Department can make a protected disclosure, what will happen when a disclosure is made and what the Department will do to protect the discloser. </p>  <p>  The process supports the Department&rsquo;s strong commitment to ensuring that the culture and working environment of the Department encourage, facilitate and support any member of staff of the Department in &lsquo;speaking up&rsquo; on any issue that may impact adversely on the Department&rsquo;s ability to properly and fully carry out all its roles and responsibilities to the high performance standard required. Two alternative confidential recipients have been nominated to receive protected disclosures from internal staff, in the event that a staff member does not wish to make the disclosure to their line manager or the normal senior management team. These nominees are the Head of Legal and the Head of Compliance. To date, neither of these officers have received such an internal protected disclosure.</p>  <p>  Section 22 of the Protected Disclosures Act requires the publication of a report in respect of protected disclosures received in the preceding year setting out certain information in respect of protected disclosures received. For the purposes of complying with Section 22, the Department publishes informatoin regarding Protected Disclosures formally identified as such, without identifying the person making the disclosure.  Previous reports indicate that one protected disclosure was received in 2017 and one in 2018. One protected disclosure received during 2019 will be included in the report to be published by June of this year. That disclosure remains under active investigation and correspondence with the discloser is ongoing.</p></reply>

The expense should apply to all employees in that category and not be discretionary. Revenue has advised me that it will consider FRE applications where a large number of employees incur broadly identical qualifying expenses which are not reimbursed by their employer. Applications are generally made by the representative bodies in the employment sectors concerned and are considered by Revenue based on the specific commonality of expenses within the employment category and compliance with the strictly applied statutory requirement for a tax deduction.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Revenue recently announced its decision to defer the implementation of any planned changes to the FRE regime until 1 January 2021, pending the outcome of a review relating to the tax deductibility of expenses in employment by the Tax Strategy Group (TSG).  The TSG, which is overseen by my Department, will examine policy and legislative options relating to a number of aspects of the current eligibility requirements for entitlement to tax relief for expenses incurred in employment.  Notwithstanding this review, I understand Revenue is willing to engage with representative bodies of any large groups of employees, including staff of the National Ambulance Service, to consider an application for flat rate employment expenses.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it remains committed to the FRE regime and encourages all taxpayers to avail of their full tax relief entitlements.  The Deputy will be aware from previous replies to questions about the FRE regime that, outside of the regime, all employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent which the expenses are not reimbursed by the employer.</p></reply>

Set out below is some relevant context to and rationale for this decision.  </p><p>In my Budget 2020 financial statement I announced an increase to the rate of carbon tax from &euro;20 to &euro;26 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions. This is the first increase to the carbon tax rate since 2012. My decision to increase the rate followed an examination of all relevant factors including the impact on households and is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling climate change. </p><p>The impact on the most commonly used household fuel bundles is set out in the following table:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Fuel Type</th>       <th>Typical Fuel Bundle</th>       <th>Carbon tax at &euro;20 (incl VAT)</th>       <th>Carbon Tax at &euro;26 (incl VAT)</th>       <th>Impact of Increase (incl VAT)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Petrol</td>       <td>60 litre fill</td>       <td>&euro;3.39</td>       <td>&euro;4.42</td>       <td>&euro;1.03</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Diesel</td>       <td>60 litre fill</td>       <td>&euro;3.93</td>       <td>&euro;5.11</td>       <td>&euro;1.18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerosene</td>       <td>900 litre fill</td>       <td>&euro;51.82</td>       <td>&euro;67.15</td>       <td>&euro;15.33</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Peat</td>       <td>12.5kg bale</td>       <td>&euro;0.52</td>       <td>&euro;0.68</td>       <td>&euro;0.16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Coal</td>       <td>40 kg bag</td>       <td>&euro;2.39</td>       <td>&euro;3.11</td>       <td>&euro;0.72</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Natural Gas*</td>       <td>11,000 kwh annual consumption </td>       <td>&euro;46.19</td>       <td>&euro;58.80</td>       <td>&euro;12.61</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Data from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, Water and Energy (&ldquo;CRU&rdquo;) shows that the average household consumption of natural gas per annum is 11,000 MWh.</p><p>The recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action and the 2019 Climate Action Plan to increase the rate of carbon tax to &euro;80 per tonne of emission by 2030 received cross-party support. Instead of a larger increase in any one year, the Government committed to a &euro;6 increase as a first step towards the 2030 target. In order to ease in the increase I decided to delay the commencement of the increase for marked gas oil and home heating fuels until 1 May 2020, a time of the year when home heating requirements are low.  </p><p>In Budget 2020, I also made provision for ringfencing all additional revenue arising from carbon tax increases. At this point it was estimated that the &euro;6 increase would provide additional revenue of some &euro;90 million in 2020 which has been allocated for expenditure on measures related to climate action, protecting the vulnerable and the Just Transition. Some &euro;34 million was allocated to protecting those most vulnerable to fuel poverty by increasing the national fuel allowance payment and providing increased funding for energy efficiency upgrades. </p><p>Analysis conducted by the Department of Finance (<i><i>A distributional analysis of Budget 2020 Tax and Welfare measures</i></i>) using the ESRI SWITCH microsimulation model, confirms that households in the bottom three income deciles will experience a net positive impact in their equivalised disposable income as a result of the changes introduced in Budget 2020 when account is taken of the increase in carbon tax, the increase in fuel allowance and the range of other welfare measures announced. In particular, the analysis finds that any regressive impact of the carbon tax is outweighed by the increase in social welfare transfers and direct tax measures, even before the fuller benefits of the announced carbon tax revenue recycling are accounted for.</p><p>Further, whereas the carbon tax increase for home heating fuels applies from 1 May 2020, the increase of &euro;2 per week in the national fuel allowance applied from 6 January 2020. In order to ensure the most vulnerable groups are provided with additional targeted financial supports in a timely and efficient manner, Minister Doherty and I recently announced that the term of this scheme is to be extended by 4 weeks until 8 May (as a one-off measure).  I am acutely aware of the financial uncertainty and strain that many households and businesses are facing as a result of the restrictions in place to limit the spread of Covid19.In order to alleviate this pressure the Government implemented a series of supports including emergency welfare payments, a wage subsidy scheme as well as a major expansion of supports in liquidity measures for businesses affected by Covid19.</p><p>As I have outlined, the impact of the carbon tax increase on a typical fuel bundle is moderate and financial supports are in place to protect those most exposed to fuel poverty as well as businesses who are impacted by Covid19.</p></reply>

It is the pension that is reduced and not the salary in the new job.</p>  <p>  Abatement is an important component of public service pension policy and addresses legitimate public concerns about the simultaneous payment of both a valuable pension as well as a salary in the public service.  The principle of abatement of a public service pension has also long been in existence within the rules of various public service pension schemes.</p>  <p>  Finally, the application of abatement does not prevent a retired public servant from taking up other paid employment in the public service post retirement.  Generally, decisions taken by individuals to take up new public service positions after retirement are, of course, voluntary in nature. </p></reply>

The Report contains a broad range of recommendations which include:</p>  <p>  - An increase of 10% in the Military Service Allowance which is a unique payment to the Defence Forces and paid to the majority of ranks. The overall annual estimated cost of this measure is &euro;4.8 million p.a. </p>  <p>  - Restoration of a 10% reduction in respect of duty allowances such as Security Duty Allowance and Patrol Duty Allowance that were introduced under the Haddington Road Agreement.  The 10% cuts to overseas allowances was also restored. The overall estimated cost of the restoration of these measures is &euro;3.3 million p.a.</p>  <p>  - Restoration of premium weekend payment rates which were approximately halved under the Haddington Road Agreement. The annual estimated cost of this measure is &euro;1.4 million p.a.</p>  <p>  - Restoration of the Pilots  Service Commitment Scheme for Flying Officers which is aimed at attracting  pilots to continue in service on being able to stand down from the Air Corps. This Scheme was withdrawn in 2010. The cost of this measure is estimated at &euro;600,00 p.a. depending on take up.</p>  <p>  The Government also approved a high level plan for the implementation of the recommendations in the Report which provides for further measures in the short, medium and longer term. </p>  <p>  The increase in Military Service Allowance and the restoration of the rates of the other allowances, as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission, have been paid and are in addition to measures relating to core pay which are in the current Public Service Stability Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendations on the Defence Forces, taken together with the pay measures provided for under the PSSA, represent a tangible package of pay improvements for the members of our Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Public pay has been, and continues to be, determined in a public service wide context in Ireland and in a collective bargaining context under the framework of successive public service agreements. This is appropriate given the size of the Irish public service and in the interests of maintaining control of the public finances. There are no plans to change these arrangements.</p></reply>

In relation specifically to investigations under the Act, advice was received by my Department that privacy should be respected and personal information should not be released.</p><p>It is always open to the Commission, as a data controller, to seek the advice of the Data Protection Commissioner in relation to any issues that arise in the context of its annual lobbying report.  </p></reply>

Among the measures announced was the Sustaining Enterprise Fund which will be operated by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and which will provide total funding of &euro;180m by way of repayable advances to businesses.</p>  <p>  Scope for higher levels of lending under a number of loan schemes was also announced. Total available funding of &euro;450 under the Covid-Working Capital Loan Scheme, additional funding of &euro;200m under the Future Growth Loan Scheme, and an extra &euro;20m available to Microfinance Ireland to lend to microenterprises under the Microfinance Ireland COVID-19 Loan Scheme were also announced.</p>  <p>  In April the Government also announced a temporary &euro;15m Public Service Obligation (PSO) for strategic maritime connections. This will assist businesses with their supply chain.</p>  <p>  On May 2nd, Government announced a further suite of measures amounting to c. &euro;6.5bn to further support small, medium and larger business that are negatively impacted by COVID-19. These measures aim to support businesses to restart, reconnect and rehire staff who have been laid off or furloughed. These include:</p>  <p>  - A &euro;250m Restart Fund for micro and small businesses who have suffered a dramatic loss in turnover as a result of COVID-19. Companies will receive up to &euro;10,000 based on a rates/waiver rebate from 2019;</p>  <p>  - &euro;260m for a three month commercial rates waiver for businesses who have been forced to close due to public health requirements as a result of COVID-19; </p>  <p>  - A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises;</p>  <p>  - A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates. The introduction of this scheme will require new legislation.</p>  <p>  - The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue. The introduction of this scheme will require new legislation.</p>  <p>  - A commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall, so that local authorities can continue provide full services to the public. </p>  <p>  A number of measures have been announced by both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland which are designed to assist enterprises to deal with the challenges which now confront them, for example, the &euro;2m Covid-19 Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme were introduced on a temporary, 12-week basis and are due to expire in mid-June. Reforms made to Illness Benefit and Sick Pay were also introduced for an initial period of 12 weeks.</p>  <p>  In the short term, the wage subsidy scheme is supporting the maintenance of the crucial link between employers and their employees. In recognition of the liquidity problems facing businesses, local authorities are working with the most impacted businesses in relation to deferral of payment for commercial rates. The Revenue Commissioners have also set out a series of actions to support small and medium enterprises experiencing cash flow difficulties. </p>  <p>  A wide range of policies and schemes have been put in place by Government in order to respond to the major challenges arising from Covid-19. This has been a cross-Government response, with schemes to support different sectors of society being led by different Departments and Offices. The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to oversee the expenditure impacts of the response and, as is usual, to ensure that public funds are being utilised in an appropriate way. </p></reply>

This represents a significant investment that will be partly funded through additional borrowing with a deficit of c. &euro;23 billion projected for this year. This expenditure amount reflected Government decisions at that time in relation to:</p><p>- Social Protection measures &ndash; Illness Benefit, the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP);</p><p>- an amount was also included in respect of the estimated impact on income supports of the projections in relation to unemployment underpinning the fiscal scenario outlined in the SPU;</p><p>- Costs arising in the Health Sector;</p><p>- Exchequer funding to support business related liquidity measures.</p><p>There have been a number of developments in the period since publication of the SPU. On 2nd May, the Government adopted an additional suite of measures, targeted towards the business sector. The measures include liquidity supports (guaranteed loans and additional tax forbearance), additional investment funds (ISIF2 for medium- and larger-sized enterprises; establishment of an enterprise fund for micro- and small-sized enterprises) and the waiving of commercial rates for businesses forced to temporarily close due to restrictions.</p><p>  From a statistical classification perspective, not all of these measures are included in estimates of the general government balance &ndash; loan guarantees, for instance, are contingent liabilities rather than actual liabilities. </p><p>Given that the <i>Revised Estimates for Public Services</i>(REV) 2020, published on 18th December 2019, had not been voted before the dissolution of the D&aacute;il there is scope to reflect the Covid-19 related measures that impact on voted expenditure in new Departmental Estimates for 2020 to be presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. </p><p>Additional borrowing will be required to predominantly fund the introduction of these Covid-19 related measures this year. </p></reply>

This policy applies for the duration of the PSSA.</p><p>Under that policy, increases granted to serving staff over the course of the PSSA are passed on to those pensions awarded under pre-existing public service schemes where the salary on which the pension is based does not exceed the salary of serving staff with the same grade and scale point, after the pay increase has been applied. If it qualifies, the pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff.  </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Single Public Service Pension Scheme introduced for new entrants to the public service from 1 January 2013 onwards is a career average pension scheme which provides that both the referable amounts that are accrued by serving staff while in employment, as well as pensions in payment, are uprated in line with changes in the consumer price index.</p><p>My understanding is that the processing of increases for Garda Pensioners arising from pay rises under the PSSA is up to date at present and that no backlog exists. </p><p>As regards the representation of pensioner concerns, I can advise that my officials and I have engaged with public service pensioners in relation to public service pensions issues through meetings with the Alliance of Retired Public Servants (ARPS). Over the past few years, the interests and concerns of public service pensioners have been regularly articulated in those meetings. Through this process of engagement, I believe that public service pensioners have had, and continue to be afforded, a meaningful and direct means of articulating their concerns on pensions and related issues.</p></reply>

The membership of this Forum includes public service management and union representatives. </p>  <p>  The implications arising from this claim extend well beyond the CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors cadre and could have  impacts across the entire Community and Voluntary sector (which may employ over 100,000 people).  While CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represent only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees would inevitably give rise to claims for similar schemes and funding provision on the part of those many thousands of workers in the broader sector. Accordingly there has to be regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, a detailed scoping exercise was carried out by my Department in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of the issues involved.</p>  <p>  The scoping exercise found that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost exposure for the State of between &euro;188m and &euro;347m per annum (depending on the exact size of the sector which is difficult to ascertain) were consequential demands to be made to fund employer pension contributions for all similar State funded Community and Voluntary organisations whose employees are in a similar position to the Community Employment scheme supervisors.  This excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension for those imminently retiring, as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, give rise to a further Exchequer cost exposure of up to &euro;318m.</p>  <p>  It continues to be the position that state organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and accordingly it is not for the State to provide funding for occupational pension scheme provision.</p></reply>

It was not introduced in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and other Provisions) 2012 Act (the 2012 Act) but rather it is a principle that dates back to the Superannuation Act of 1834.</p>  <p>  With the introduction of the 2012 Act the application of abatement was widened.  Previously, abatement generally applied only where the pensioner returned to work in the same sector or scheme from which the pension was drawn.  As a result, the policy of abatement was not consistent in its application across sectors.  Following the introduction of the Act, the principle of abatement is now  applicable in respect of any public service employment obtained by a public service pensioner. </p>  <p>  Sections 52(1) to 52(5) of the 2012 Act provides for the abatement of a public service pension where a retired public servant, whose pension is in payment, is re-employed in the public service such that no more of the pension when combined with the remuneration in the new job shall exceed the pensionable remuneration of the old job. Once a public service pensioner ceases to be employed in the public service their pension ceases to be abated. </p>  <p>  The individual Pension Paying Authorities across the various sectors of the Public Service are responsible for ensuring that pension abatement is correctly calculated, processed and applied to pension payments as required. Information regarding the financial effects arising from the implementation of abatement is not routinely reported centrally as a matter of course.</p>  <p>  Overall, I am satisfied that the measures taken in the 2012 Act were progressive, fair and necessary. The extension of abatement across the public service was appropriate as a modernising pension reform, and abatement continues to represent a suitable and measured response to legitimate public concerns about simultaneous payment of both a valuable pension and a salary to individuals working in the public service.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also be aware that in recent years some Public Service bodies have experienced retention issues in respect of experienced personnel.  If retired individuals could return to work without being abated it could create incentives for more experienced staff to retire on pension and return to the public service workforce.  In general retired staff should be used to fill posts in very limited circumstances and on a short-term basis only with policy directed toward filling posts through normal recruitment wherever possible.</p></reply>

(SCPA).</p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that in 2017 my Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs. This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Furthermore I can inform the Deputy that starting from a level of 173 whole-tome equivalents in 2016 and following increases allowed in successive Budgets the sanctioned number for NEPS psychologist currently stands at 204 w.t.e. Some 199 of these posts are currently filled which represents the highest number of psychologists to be employed within NEPS since the inception of the service in 2000. The filling of the remaining posts is being actively pursued by my Department in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service. </p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.</p></reply>

This measure will see a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020.  This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain/recruit a teacher.  This has been implemented in the recently published Circular 0018/2020 which sets out the staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 2020/21 school year.</p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the appointment and retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and more favourable enrolment thresholds for one teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  Small schools have also benefitted from the 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule for all schools implemented in 2016 and again in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including a specific appeal measure for small schools, to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p></reply>

The arrangements include the following provisions:  </p>  <p>  - 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations will be frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and will automatically rollover into the 2020/21 school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.  </p>  <p>  - Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p>  <p>  - The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed. </p>  <p>  The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. </p>  <p>  There is no change to the employment arrangements for SNAs.  </p>  <p>  As this question relates to a particular school, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. I do not have a role in making determinations in individual cases.</p>  <p>  A new frontloading model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM). Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, the introduction of the model has been deferred for one year. </p></reply>

There are currently 60 special classes in Co. Wexford, 15 in post primary and 45 in primary schools.</p><p>167 new special classes have been established nationally for 2019/20 school year. </p><p>A list of special classes for September 2019 is available on the NCSE website at:</p><p> </p><p>Budget 2020 provided for an additional 265 special class teachers in 2020, which will allow for the opening of additional classes where required.</p><p>The NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally to meet identified need for 2020/2021 school year. This process is ongoing.</p><p>Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>Last year, the NCSE indicated that parents in Dublin 15, South Dublin, Kildare and Cork were experiencing difficulty securing school places for their children.  </p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. </p><p>The legislation has been used twice in Dublin to address shortages of special class and school places. </p><p>The legislation contains a procedure through which the NCSE can test the capacity of schools in an area to provide more special education places and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education places available. The Act prescribes a set of steps to follow which includes extensive consultation with schools and their patron bodies. </p><p>The initial step in the process is for the NCSE to inform the Minister that there is a shortage of places in a particular area.  </p><p>The NCSE will only activate the legislation after it has taken all reasonable efforts to get schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide additional special class or school places.</p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me.

Upon establishment, the siting of its multi-campuses are a matter for the relevant TU.</p>  <p>  I understand that  the TUSEI consortium, comprising IT Carlow and Waterford IT, is continuing to work towards the submission of an application seeking TU designation under the Act as expeditiously as possible. This accords with my view that it is essential that all TU development consortia accelerate and intensify their work to achieve designation and in so doing demonstrate a strongly integrated and cohesive approach to the delivery of TUs for their regions.    </p></reply>

The arrangements include the following provisions:</p>  <p>  - 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations will be frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and will automatically rollover into the 2020/21 school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way. </p>  <p>  - Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p>  <p>  - The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed. </p>  <p>  The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. </p>  <p>  As this question relates to a particular school, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. I do not have a role in making determinations in individual cases.</p>  <p>  A new frontloading model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM). Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, the introduction of the model has been deferred for one year. </p></reply>

The school transport scheme is a demand-led service based on the number of eligible children who apply to avail of transport.  Reimbursement to Bus &Eacute;ireann is on a cost recovery basis on the costs associated with the School transport Scheme. </p><p>The Department works with Bus &Eacute;ireann to analyse costs to the scheme on an on-going basis and each year the company produces an audited statement of account.  This ensures that the financial information provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann is in accordance with the relevant summary of accounting arrangements. Actual expenditure is finalised in the Bus &Eacute;ireann annual statement of account which is independently audited by the Bus &Eacute;ireann auditors in accordance with the 1975 <i>Summary of Accounting Arrangements</i>.  Balances, where they occur, are accounted for in the following year&rsquo;s projected cost. </p><p>The nature of the arrangements with Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of the School Transport Scheme involves the Company recovering direct and indirect costs. These costs are referred to as the Transport Management Charge (TMC). The TMC was designed to compensate Bus &Eacute;ireann for costs involved in running the School Transport Scheme which are not billed separately to the Department. The reason that these costs are not billed on a standalone basis is that significant indirect costs are not as easily identified as they are shared across business units and therefore had be allocated to each business unit on a fair and equitable basis. </p><p>Based on the 1975 Arrangements this Transport management charge was set at 13% of certain direct costs, which meant that any increase in the direct cost base resulted in an increase in indirect costs payable by the Department to Bus &Eacute;ireann. This resulted in a surplus on the uncommitted reserve for the school transport scheme when the actual charges were lower than the agreed TMC in any one year. In any given year this balance was ring-fenced entirely for expenditure on the school transport scheme for investment on enhancements in a number of areas of the scheme in recent years, including IT, customer service and investment in fleet.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is obliged to tender all works, goods and services in line with the European Directives on public procurement.</p></reply>

My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.</p><p>Normally, special class and school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or school places.  </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>Last year, the NCSE indicated that parents in Dublin 15, South Dublin, Kildare and Cork were experiencing difficulty securing school places for their children.  </p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed. </p><p>The legislation has been used twice in Dublin to address shortages of special class and school places. </p><p>The legislation contains a procedure through which the NCSE can test the capacity of schools in an area to provide more special education places and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education places available. The Act prescribes a set of steps to follow which includes extensive consultation with schools and their patron bodies. </p><p>The initial step in the process is for the NCSE to inform the Minister that there is a shortage of places in a particular area.  </p><p>The NCSE will only activate the legislation after it has taken all reasonable efforts to get schools and their Patrons to voluntarily agree to provide additional special class or school places.</p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The NCSE's Local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs in relation to special class provision.</p></reply>

The arrangements include the following provisions:  </p>  <p>  - 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations will be frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and will automatically rollover into the 2020/21 school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.  </p>  <p>  - Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p>  <p>  - The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed. </p>  <p>  The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. </p>  <p>  As this question relates to a particular school, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. I do not have a role in making determinations in individual cases.</p>  <p>  A new frontloading model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM). Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, the introduction of the model has been deferred for one year. </p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,953 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  This agreement is benefitting 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  Minister McHugh is fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen either in the context of any pay review mechanism agreed by the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement, or in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. </p></reply>

The arrangements include the following provisions:  </p>  <p>  - 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations will be frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and will automatically rollover into the 2020/21 school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.</p>  <p>  - Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p>  <p>  - The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed. </p>  <p>  The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. </p>  <p>  As this question relates to a particular school, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. I do not have a role in making determinations in individual cases.</p>  <p>  A new frontloading model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM). Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, the introduction of the model has been deferred for one year. </p></reply>

My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard. In considering these applications, however, the NSCE, in conjunction with the school buildings unit of my Department, will be required to take into account the capacity of a school to establish such a class, including the provision of sufficient accommodation space within the school. </p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally to meet identified need for next year. This process is ongoing.</p><p>Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or special school places.  </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  </p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The legislation was used for the first time in April 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area.</p><p>Significant progress was made in a relatively short period with the establishment of Danu Special School as well as six schools offering to open special classes.</p><p>The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p><p>The legislation was activated for a second time on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified 82 children in South Dublin needing special education school places in the current school year and a further potential 68 children needing special education school places in 2020/21.  </p><p>Since then, as required under the Act, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity among schools in the South Dublin area.</p><p>On 21 April 2020 I received a report from the NCSE, pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018) in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p><p>Before reaching this opinion, the NCSE has undertaken substantial work reviewing provision and accommodation in the 231 mainstream primary and 23 special schools in South Dublin.</p><p>Following engagement between NCSE local personnel and school management and Patrons, very good progress has been achieved. 78 ASD primary school special class placements and 12 ASD early intervention special class places have been created in 14 schools in South Dublin, with 13 new ASD special classes and 2 new ASD early intervention special classes to open for September 2020.</p><p>However, the NCSE has reported that to date, an insufficient number of schools have indicated a willingness to open additional special classes. The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an additional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.</p><p>The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.</p><p>This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.</p><p>At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.</p><p>Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process, will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.  </p></reply>

This also included a study visit to New Brunswick, Canada to see how an education system, without special schools or special classes, support students with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  The Progress Report does not draw any definitive conclusions and the preliminary findings are tentative.</p>  <p>  The NCSE progress report is available on the NCSE's website.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has commenced engagement in a public consultation with parents, students, people with disabilities, educators and other educational partners and stakeholders.

Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270.</p>  <p>  Alternatively, a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of his/her fees. The income threshold for this payment is &euro;31,500 for the 2019/2020 academic year.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p>  <p>   In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

Under this scheme, the Department provided funding of &euro;16.9 million in 2019 to all of these schools.</p><p>I also announced additional funding of &euro;1million which is being allocated to 102 Primary DEIS schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020/21 school year.The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents. Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per student.  This pilot will provide an additional &euro;64 per student to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per student enrolled in the school.  This additional funding will issue to schools in May 2020.  </p><p>School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and in order to support the establishment of book rental schemes my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to primary schools.  Circa. 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme </p><p>It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school but they are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those most in need.  Therefore, my Department does not hold information in relation to these costs. </p><p>Indicative estimate of providing free primary and secondary school books to all pupils across all fully publicly funded schools based on a survey by Barnardos is &euro;40M.</p><p>Each 1% increase in the book grant for primary and post-primary schools would cost approximately &euro;170,000.

Outright abolition of 3rd level fees for the student is understood to mean the abolition of the Student Contribution of &euro;3,000.</p>  <p>  The Student Contribution, was introduced with effect from the 2011/12 academic year. There has been no increase in the contribution since 2014/15. The Exchequer pays this contribution (or part of it) on behalf of almost 50% of undergraduate students who eligible for free fees and in receipt of student grant support.</p>  <p>  If the Student Contribution were abolished from the 2020/21 academic year and the Exchequer were to move to funding the full tuition fee costs of eligible full-time undergraduate students,  the estimated additional cost for the Exchequer would be &euro;238million.  This is the estimated net cost to the Exchequer since it factors in the subsequent estimated reduction in the SUSI Student Grant budget, since the Exchequer would then no longer pay the Student Contribution on behalf of undergraduate students in receipt of student grant support.</p>  <p>  The costs for the Exchequer of reducing or abolishing the student contribution would increase in line with the demographic increases expected in the coming years up to 2030.</p>  <p>  The figures above relate to full time undergraduate students who qualify for the Free Fees Initiative. They do not take account of fees determined by Higher Education Institutions such as fees for full-time undergraduate students who do not qualify for the Free Fees Initiative [and who may pay the EU or Non EU fees rate], or fees for part-time undergraduates or any post-graduate students or other additional fees charged by HEIs.</p></reply>

Pending the completion of this review my Department is not planning to amend the qualifying criteria of the Free Fees Initiative.</p><p>Currently the Free Fees Initiative provides that the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees of eligible students pursuing an approved full-time undergraduate course of study in an approved institution in the State. Eligible students must meet the terms of the scheme including the nationality and residency clauses. The residency clause stipulates that eligible students must be ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA state, the Swiss Confederation or United Kingdom for three of the five years preceding entry to their course of study.</p><p>Where undergraduate students do not qualify for free fees they are required to pay fees to their higher education institution at either an &lsquo;EU rate&rsquo; or a higher &lsquo;Non-EU rate&rsquo;. It is a matter for the relevant higher education institution to determine the fee rate based on its own criteria.</p><p>My Department responded previously to concerns about the impact of the free fees eligibility criteria on individuals who have had, for occupational or economic reasons, to move abroad, requiring them to take their children out of the Irish education system in the process. </p><p>To this end, in March 2014 my Department requested that the Higher Education Authority (HEA) advise the higher education sector that full-time undergraduate students who;</p><p>- Hold EU/EEA/Swiss nationality but do not meet the residency clause of the Free Fees Initiative; and</p><p>- have completed five academic years of study (at either primary or post-primary level) in an EU/EEA/Swiss State; and</p><p>- commence their first undergraduate course of study in an approved institution here from the following academic year onwards</p><p>should be charged the EU rate of fee rather than the higher non-EU rate by their higher education institution.  </p><p>This approach was implemented for new students from the commencement of the 2014/15 academic year.</p></reply>

No new post-primary schools are currently planned for the South County Tipperary -Clonmel School Planning Area. The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  There are currently four post-primary schools in the Clonmel school planning area, three of which are classified as denominational and one as multi-denominational (under the patronage of Tipperary Education and Training Board). </p>  <p>  ETB schools are multi-denominational schools and as such are required to serve their communities. This includes providing for religious instruction according to the profile of the students who attend the school.</p>  <p>  Circulars 13/2018 and 62/2018 set out the arrangements for certain multi-denominational post primary schools, including ETB schools to consult with parents and in the case of pupils who have reached the age of 18, the pupil, to ascertain their wishes in relation to religious instruction and worship. Schools are required to incorporate parental choice regarding religious instruction as part of the normal processes for planning and timetabling generally. </p>  <p>  Recently commenced sections of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 also contain a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school&rsquo;s arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.</p></reply>

Since almost all of the young people who attend CAMHS units are aged between twelve and eighteen years, the predominant educational need is for the post-primary curriculum. While the student cohort primarily have psychiatric or mental health difficulties they are capable, when medically fit to do so, of following the mainstream post-primary curriculum.   </p>  <p>  Not all children/young people attending CAMHS are medically fit to avail of education during all of their stay. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s policy is to provide teaching staff in CAMHS facilities at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 on the basis of the number of inpatient beds in each CAMHS unit. The facility referred to by the deputy has one such special school. Referrals to the school are a matter for each CAMHS unit.</p>  <p>  Current policy does not provide for an additional teaching allocation for CAMHS facilities for children/young people attending as day or out-patients, as young people attending CAMHs as day patients can apply for Home Tuition support to provide for compensatory education in respect of time missed from school, due to medical reasons or attendance at a medical unit. </p>  <p>  As not all inpatient beds in CAMHS Units may be filled at any given time, in such instances, subject to prior approval by my Department, CAMHS Units may utilise spare teaching capacity from their allocated 6:1 ratio to offer guidance or support for children/young people attending CAMHS facilities as day patients, and to assist in maintaining some continuity of education from their base school or liaison with their base school on days that they attend the CAMHS Unit.</p>  <p>  As my Department does not retain information on individual young people who attend or are in-patients in  CAMHS Units under the remit of the HSE, my Department is not aware of the issues relating to the individual referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This measure will see a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020.  This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain/recruit a teacher.  This has been implemented in the recently published Circular 0018/2020 which sets out the staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 2020/21 school year.</p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the appointment and retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and more favourable enrolment thresholds for one teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  Small schools have also benefitted from the 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule for all schools implemented in 2016 and again in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including a specific appeal measure for small schools, to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.</p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised. </p><p>In Budget 2020 I increased the number of secretaries and caretakers in certain schools, allowing schools with enrolments of 500-625 to fill secretary vacancies provided they have fewer than 1.5 secretaries; schools with enrolments of 626-699 to fill vacancies provided they have fewer than two secretary posts filled, and schools of 700 or more to fill caretaker vacancies provided they have fewer than two caretakers.  These measures will take effect from September 2020. </p><p>In Spring 2019 I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This was an initial step and took immediate effect.</p><p>Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the capi</p><p>The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p><p>On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019. </p><p>The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendation applies.</p><p>The survey of Secretaries and Caretakers identified some schools that are non-compliant with the provisions of the 2015 Arbitration Agreement, and my Department has contacted these schools to remind them of their obligations under the agreement, as implemented through various circulars. The links below will bring you to the most recent circulars in respect of the pay increases under the 2015 Arbitration Agreement.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April 2019 to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p><p>In May last year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim. </p><p>This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasted until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July 2019 to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p><p>Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives last September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action. </p><p>On 30 September 2019 F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p><p>In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department and Management Bodies are in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC. These talks are subject to the normal procedures including confidentiality. The talks began in the WRC in October.</p><p>Following industrial action, which commenced on the 10th January, both parties have agreed to return to talks at the WRC.  F&Oacute;RSA agreed to the WRC request to suspend their ongoing work-to-rule to allow the talks to progress. This suspension was effective from 21stJanuary 2020.</p></reply>

The arrangements include the following provisions:</p>  <p>  - 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations will be frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and will automatically rollover into the 2020/21 school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.  </p>  <p>  - Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p>  <p>  - The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed. </p>  <p>  The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. </p>  <p>  As this question relates to a particular school, I have referred the question to the NCSE for their direct reply. I do not have a role in making determinations in individual cases.</p>  <p>  A new frontloading model for allocating Special Needs Assistants to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM). Due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, the introduction of the model has been deferred for one year. </p></reply>

But some students may find it difficult to manage full-time placement in mainstream and so placement in a Special Class or Special School setting may be deemed appropriate where placement in mainstream class is not in the best interests of the child.</p><p>Special Schools funded by my Department are established as special primary schools and cater for children and young persons with complex special educational needs from the age of 4 years until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th year.</p><p>Provision in our 124 special schools has also increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year.</p><p>Nationally, 167 new special classes opened this school year, which means there are 1,618 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard. In considering these applications, however, the NSCE, in conjunction with the school buildings unit of my Department, consider the capacity of the school for such a class including the availability of suitable accommodation. </p><p>The NCSE is finalising plans for a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally to meet identified need for September 2020. This process is ongoing.</p><p>Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to voluntarily agree to provide special class or special school places. </p><p>I know that this can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>As Minister I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  </p><p>I would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from me. It is the right thing for the children in a community.</p><p>The process was first activated in April 2019 when the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) informed my Department under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 of a shortage of school places for children with special educational needs in the Dublin 15 area.</p><p>This was followed by an extended and intensive engagement with schools in the area, seeking their willingness to open a special class.</p><p>In May 2019, letters issued to the principals and chairpersons of boards of management in 22 schools in Dublin 15 requesting that they give serious consideration to the need for more special education provision.</p><p>In June 2019, my Department served statutory notices under Section 37A (5) on 18 schools and 2 patrons in Dublin 15. These notices communicated my opinion that they should make additional provision for children with special educational needs.</p><p>Following further consultations with two patron bodies and site visits by technical teams to the schools, in August 2019 second legal notices were served under Section 37A on 6 schools in Dublin 15 </p><p>Significant progress was made as a result of this process with 7 primary schools in the Dublin 15 area agreeing to open ASD special classes, providing special class places for 42 children along with the establishment of the new Danu Community Special School with provision for 40 special school places.</p><p>6 of the new special classes were established following the activation of Section 37A of the Education Act 1998. 1 school volunteered to establish a special class.</p><p>The experience of Dublin 15 shows the real and practical challenges that can be addressed when opening new special classes and how we can resolve these challenges by working together and in partnership.</p><p>The legislation was activated for a second time on the 29th October, 2019 following a report by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which identified 82 children in South Dublin needing special education school places in the current school year and a further potential 68 children needing special education school places in 2020/21.  </p><p>Since then, as required under the Act, the NCSE in consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, has been testing the capacity among schools in the South Dublin area.</p><p>On 21 April 2020, I received a report from the NCSE , pursuant to Section 37A(2) of the Education Act 1998 in respect of South Dublin, as the NCSE Council remains of the opinion that there is an insufficient number of special class and special school places within the South Dublin area for September 2020.</p><p>Before reaching this opinion, the NCSE had undertaken substantial work reviewing provision and accommodation in the 231 mainstream primary and 23 special schools in South Dublin.</p><p>Following engagement between NCSE local personnel and school management and Patrons, 78 ASD primary school special class placements and 12 ASD early intervention special class places have been created in 14 schools in South Dublin, with 13 new ASD special classes and 2 new ASD early intervention special classes to open for September 2020.</p><p>However, the NCSE has reported that to date, an insufficient number of schools have indicated a willingness to open additional special classes. The NCSE is of the opinion that should this continue, there remains a need for an additional 43 ASD primary special class places and 36 special school places in South Dublin.</p><p>The report also outlines the schools that should be requested to make additional provision.</p><p>This report will now be considered and if I agree with the position as set out by NCSE, next steps in the process will be considered which may include serving a statutory notice on schools identified if required.</p><p>At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration.</p><p>Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The necessary steps in the Admissions Act process will continue to be expedited to ensure that every child has a suitable school placement, which is the key objective of my Department.</p></reply>

This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process. </p>  <p>  The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction i.e. Irish or English for their child&rsquo;s education. </p>  <p>  Following a patronage process, the patronage of the new school to serve the Killester_Raheny_Clontarf school planning area was awarded to Educate Together as an English-medium school in line with the parental preferences received during the process. </p>  <p>  In September 2019, I announced that five of the new primary schools being established from 2020-2022 are being designated for Irish-medium education, including new gaelscoileanna to serve Donabate and to serve Donaghmede_Howth_D13 to be established in 2020 and 2021 respectively. The five new schools will serve areas of growing populations where there is no existing Irish-medium primary school or where there is more than one new school to be established between 2019 and 2022.

The process, which involves the live transfer of existing schools, is designed to provide additional multi-/non-denominational schools in Irish or English and an opportunity is available to English-medium schools seeking to make a transition to Irish-medium provision in that context, in line with the expressed wishes of parents and the local school community. Any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage, including transitioning to Irish-medium provision, should contact their school patron directly. </p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard to the impact of the increased roll out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.  My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools, including gaelscoileanna, may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population.</p>  <p>  Details of schools that provide education through the medium of Irish are available on my Department's website www.education.ie.</p></reply>

In that regard, there are restrictions on the amount of temporary accommodation that can be placed on the permanent site.  </p>  <p>  Therefore it will not be possible for the school referred to by the Deputy to increase its enrolment intake beyond the current intake level (which is up to 48 pupils for its 1st year intake) for 2020/2021 academic year.</p>  <p>  In relation to School Planning Areas, in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022),  including a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school which was established in 2019 to serve the Donaghmede_Howth_D13/Belmayne/Clongriffin school planning area. Patronage of the new school was awarded to Educate Together and the school opened in suitable interim accommodation in September 2019 pending delivery of the permanent accommodation for the school.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, Balgriffin is located in the adjacent Portmarnock school planning area. As the Deputy may be aware, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school was established in 2018 to serve the Malahide and Portmarnock school planning areas as a regional solution and has just under 70 pupils enrolled in the 2019/20 school year.</p>  <p>  New schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required, in the first instance, to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area where they have sufficient places.</p>  <p>  In relation to school admissions, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils in the area seeking school places.</p></reply>

The review involved extensive consultation between June 2018 and October 2019. Key recommendations from the review included the following:</p>  <p>  - in the short term the NCCA would begin work on interim guidance to support the teaching of SPHE/RSE in schools;</p>  <p>  - work on a single online access point for RSE resources to commence in 2020. The NCCA will also develop a set of overarching guidelines to inform the development of future SPHE/RSE resources;</p>  <p>  - the NCCA would examine opportunities for SPHE/RSE within the Junior Cycle Wellbeing area of learning, beginning in 2020;</p>  <p>  - the NCCA would also begin work in 2020 on redeveloping the overall SPHE/RSE curriculum in schools. This extensive piece of work will involve wide public consultation with all stakeholders over the next couple of years;</p>  <p>  - Other recommendations in the report in relation to Initial Teacher Education (ITE) and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) regarding SPHE and RSE would be reviewed by my Department, with a view to putting enhanced supports in place.</p>  <p>  My Department and the NCCA are putting in place plans to progress recommendations such as the interim guidance to support the teaching of SPHE/RSE. Two development groups, for primary and post-primary, have been established by the NCCA to oversee the work on the interim guidance. These groups have yet to meet due to the COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings.</p>  <p>  The NCCA are also collaborating with my Department on the development of an online portal to support Wellbeing (including SPHE/RSE) in schools. A review of the experience of Wellbeing in Junior Cycle is also underway. Other aspects of the NCCA review are also being considered by my Department.</p></reply>

This provision has been superceded by new arragements for the allocation of SNAs to schools.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, schools have been notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2020/21.  The arrangements include the following provisions:  </p>  <p>  - 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations will be frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and will automatically rollover into the 2020/21 school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.  </p>  <p>  - Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. </p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.  </p>  <p>  - The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for exceptional review received prior to 22nd May 2020 by 30th June 2020 and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. Applications for an Exceptional Review received after 22 May 2020 will continue to be processed once all other applications have been completed. </p>  <p>  The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year.</p></reply>

However, the NCSE review found a number of problems with the scheme. These include concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided to all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The Council recommended that the relevant Government Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe, social environment for all students with complex special educational needs, which will include some children with Down syndrome.</p><p>My Department has convened an Implementation Group to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered. </p><p>There has been consultation with a number of other Departments and State agencies regarding the future direction of the July Education Programme.  </p><p>It is expected that proposals for a revised scheme will be submitted shortly following which there will be consultations with stakeholders before final decisions are made.</p></reply>

It is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016. It is, as I am sure the Deputy will agree, a very important task which must be done thoroughly and correctly. </p>  <p>  My Department has no role in the processing of individual vetting applications.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that the Vetting Bureau works to ensure that the processing time for vetting applications is kept to the minimum necessary in order to ensure that the statutory obligation to receive a vetting disclosure prior to permitting any person to undertake relevant work or activities on behalf of an organisation can be facilitated without undue delay.</p>  <p>  All Garda vetting applications are processed on a first come, first served basis in chronological order from date of receipt. This is with a view to observing equity and fairness in respect of all vetting subjects. </p>  <p>  In respect of certain applications, it is necessary for the Vetting Bureau to conduct further enquiries; for example to confirm information provided by the applicant with external bodies. The time required to receive such information may be outside of the control of the Vetting Bureau. In such instances, processing times may be significantly longer than the average.</p>  <p>  However I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in general, the vetting process is working well and that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda vetting at present. </p>  <p>  This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The general turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the e-vetting system is 4 working days for over 85% of applications received.</p>  <p>  Individual applicants can also track the process of their application online using the e-vetting tracking system, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online. </p></reply>

This would include an original in date passport. The onus rests with the person and their home country&rsquo;s authorities to sort out the procurement of their own national passport. The conditions under which a national passport is issued or renewed is essentially a matter for the person to address with their own national authorities.</p>  <p>  In rare circumstances where an applicant cannot produce their current passport, the applicant will be required to provide a full explanation. Such explanation should, where possible, be supported by satisfactory evidence that they have attempted to obtain such documentation and correspondence from the relevant authorities or embassy responsible for the issuing of passports in their country, clearly stating the reasons the documentation cannot be provided. The Immigration Service Delivery will consider the explanation given and, if satisfied it is for reasons genuinely beyond the applicant's control, may suggest alternative means to the person to assist in establishing their identity and nationality.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Act provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. It provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service (DSS) within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health).  </p>  <p>  The ambition of the Act, which is wholly appropriate, does mean that it is challenging and complex to implement.  A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing.   </p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed to enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options.  </p>  <p>  To provide safeguards against exploitation of persons with decision-making difficulties, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 creates a number of offences in relation to persons with decision-making capacity difficulties. In particular, section 145 of the Act provides that a decision-making assistant, co-decision-maker, decision-making representative, attorney, or designated healthcare representative for a person who wilfully ill-treats or neglects that person will be guilty of an offence.   </p>  <p>  The Act also creates a number of offences in relation to coercion or undue influence of a person with capacity difficulties that forces the person to enter into, alter or revoke one of the decision-making support arrangements under the Act.  Coercion or undue influence includes any case where a person&rsquo;s access to, or continued stay in, a designated centre or mental health facility, is contingent (whether in whole or in part) on the person having to, or being led to believe that he or she has to, enter into (or alter or revoke) a decision-making support arrangement.</p>  <p>  Further to this, the Policing and Community Safety Bill is being drafted by my Department to give legislative effect to the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI). It will redefine policing to include prevention of harm to those who are vulnerable and place an obligation on relevant state agencies to cooperate with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the broader issue of community safety. It will also provide for a new coherent governance and oversight framework to empower the Garda Commissioner to act as CEO supported and held to account by a non-executive Board, ensure strong internal governance and robust, transparent external oversight and effective accountability which will ultimately lead to a better run organisation and more effective policing. </p>  <p>  Although significant operational and other policy across health sector organisations has been in place for some time, the Minister for Health has identified a need to establish a national sectorial policy for safeguarding adults in the health and social care sector. The Government subsequently approved the development of an overarching policy on adult safeguarding across the public, voluntary and private health sector. </p>  <p>  As I understand it, the Department of Health is advancing the necessary work, including client, expert and stakeholder engagement, and that preparation of this policy is advancing well. At present, the aim is to substantially complete work this year on a draft health sector policy subject to Government approval, with a focus in 2021 of preparing and planning for implementation, including consideration of necessary actions and tools to support roll out across health and social care services. In the meantime, adult safeguarding in the health and social care sector is addressed on the basis of: </p>  <p>  Cross-sectorial legislation such as vetting legislation, legislation on withholding information on certain offences against children and vulnerable persons, criminal law, equal status legislation, legislation underpinning the National Disability Inclusion Strategy and assisted decision-making (capacity) legislation;  </p>  <p>  An operational policy, currently under revision, which applies to all HSE and HSE-funded social care services (the "&ldquo;Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons at Risk of Abuse - National Policy and Procedures (2014)&rdquo; and joint national adult safeguarding standards prepared by the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Mental Health Commission and approved in 2019 by the Minister for Health, applicable to regulated social care and healthcare (including mental health) services.</p></reply>

These experiences can be devastating for those affected.</p>  <p>  In recent years, a whole-of-government response was taken to addressing these complex issues, in particular through the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018 - 2019 which identified a range of positive actions to address online safety issues, including cyber-bullying.  There has been a general consensus in recent years that the appropriate response to addressing such online issues is one that encompasses educational and awareness raising campaigns, as well as effective actions and policies on the part of internet companies.</p>  <p>  In relation to harassment laws specifically, the Law Reform Commission published a report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety in 2016 which recommended a number of legislative changes in order to deal more effectively with the negative aspects of increased use of online communications.</p>  <p>  Many of the recommendations outlined in this report were provided for in a Private Members Bill sponsored by Deputy Brendan Howlin - the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017.  </p>  <p>  In May of last year, the Government approved the approach to be taken and, in order to ensure that legislation in this area would be enacted as swiftly as possible, agreed to adopt and amend that Bill.  My Department then began a close engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to draft amendments to the Bill, to ensure consistency in its provisions and significantly strengthen the law in this area including through the proposed creation of a number of new offences.  The amendments would also have removed some of the civil provisions in the Bill that might be more appropriately dealt with through proposals to establish the Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner, which was being progressed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. </p>  <p>  I expect these matters will be reintroduced but that is a matter for the incoming Government to decide.</p></reply>

This is being actioned through:</p>  <p>  - Delivery of a training module on female genital mutilation twice a year to frontline Garda&iacute;; and</p>  <p>  - Development and dissemination of an Information Guide on Female Genital Mutilation for all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The latest Report of the of Monitoring Committee for the Strategy notes that this action is meeting the targets as set out in the Strategy.  </p>  <p>  Action 61 of the Migrant Integration Strategy, sets out the State&rsquo;s obligation across Departments to provide intercultural awareness training to staff where it is appropriate to their role.  For frontline staff such as medical and Garda&iacute;, this is particularly important as they may be the first point of contact with at risk women and girls. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed under Action 63 of the Migrant Integration Strategy to continue to implement a victim-centred policy and good investigative practices in racial or other similar crimes. </p>  <p>  I note that the first conviction under that legislation was secured in the courts in November of last year and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na took the opportunity to highlight the dangers and the illegal nature of the practice.</p></reply>

The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in constructive activities and to encourage good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment. I am informed that the list of additional privileges varies between prisons and within different areas of a prison, depending on operational and infrastructure requirements. </p>  <p>  I am advised that three different regime levels are provided for and that the daily gratuity payable varies according to the regime level, as follows: basic &euro;0.95, standard &euro;1.70, and enhanced &euro;2.20. I understand that remand prisoners are treated in the same way as sentenced prisoners for the purposes of the incentivised regimes policy. </p>  <p>  I understand that the incentivised regimes policy was subject to a national review in 2019 and the review has almost concluded.  One of the issues being considered as part of the review is the level of gratuity awarded under the incentivised regimes policy, with reference to the cost of living. The review is expected to conclude with a set of recommendations to the Director General of the Irish Prison Service in the next months. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to note that prisoners may avail of further gratuities under the approved working gratuity scheme. The daily amount of the approved work gratuity is fixed for all prisons/institutions at 50 cent per session with a maximum of &euro;3.50 per week for work training activities, such as work in kitchens, laundry, industrial cleaning, grounds maintenance, industrial waste management, painting and stores.</p>  <p>Finally, I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that there is standard pricing in operation in prison shops and the decision is to charge the recommended retail price, as notified by the contracted supplier, in all prisons and I understand there is oversight in place on the prices charged.  </p></reply>

It reflects the commitment in the Programme for Government to create an equal, fair and inclusive society for all, to target discrimination and to enable LGBTI+ people to overcome the barriers they face. </p>  <p>  The development of this Strategy was underpinned by a robust consultation process from October 2018 until February 2019 including a series of regional and thematically focused workshops. Specific workshop sessions were organised for international protection applicants, migrants and refugees.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Strategy recognises the vulnerability of LGBTI+ people within the International Protection process and commits to measures to ensure they are treated sensitively and provided with appropriate supports over the course of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  These measures include the introduction of new National Standards for our accommodation centres.  The National Standards, published last August last year, were developed with UNHCR Ireland and members of the NGO community. The Standards are being implemented in new centres that are being contracted at present. </p>  <p>  One of the Standards, which will benefit members of the LGBTI+ community in our accommodation centres, will be the need for continuous training to improve the service for all living in the centre, and confidential information provision through leaflets and posters in order to promote dignity. </p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy of some current measures in place in our centres.</p>  <p>  A Policy and Practice Document on safeguarding residents against Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence &amp;amp; Harassment is implemented in our accommodation centres, which includes safeguarding residents from harassment or violence based on their sexual orientation.    </p>  <p>  The International Protection Accommodation Service of my Department  (IPAS ) have staff present at the International Protection Office when a person first applies for International Protection. Should an applicant require accommodation or other services, IPAS determines the most suitable accommodation based on the needs of each individual or family group.  Where a person discloses their self-determined identity to IPAS, they are, in so far as is possible and practicable, assigned accommodation based on their needs. This determination may include the provision of shared accommodation with a partner who is also seeking accommodation or being accommodated within the Direct Provision system.  This would, of course, only apply where this information is disclosed.  </p>  <p>  At any time during their stay in an accommodation centre, a resident has the option to request a transfer to a more suitable centre.  The policy of the IPAS is to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of all residents. Staff working in accommodation centres receive regular training to equip them with the skills to support all residents.  </p>  <p>  The IPAS liaises with State and NGO support agencies to assist our residents who may need guidance or support.  In this regard, LGBT Ireland work with residents in our centres who identify as LGBTI. </p>  <p>  Since 2018, LGBT Ireland has facilitated a monthly peer support group for LGBTI+ people in the International Protection process.  Is Rainbow Muid continues to be active and provide vital supports to LGBTI+ people living in our accommodation centres at this time.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that IPAS together with the Inclusion, Equality and Gender Equality Unit of my Department are in the process of developing a broad LGBTI+ policy, which will include a transgender accommodation policy to promote equality, take account of people's self-determined identity and ensure that the safety and wellbeing of all residents is also promoted. </p>  <p>  It had been hoped that the LGBTI+ policy for IPAS would be finalised by the end of the first quarter of this year. Unfortunately, this was not possible due to the Covid-19 crisis. However, important contacts have been made between IPAS and support agencies in the LGBTI community and a meeting between LGBT Ireland and IPAS took place at the beginning of March 2020. Further meetings with TENI and BelongTo will be arranged soon. </p></reply>

Inevitably, Covid-19 has impacted on some areas. However, I understand that the implementation group is continuing to work with key stakeholders to identify and agree priority actions for implementation and is actively engaged in ensuring continued momentum on the key reforms, in so far as possible under the current circumstances. </p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that much has already been achieved under the Plan.  For example:</p><p>- The roll-out of a new Operating Model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has commenced. This model is designed to streamline Garda administration and to provide a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide;</p><p>- An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has established and strengthened resourcing of a Human Rights Unit and re-established the Strategic Human Rights Advisory Committee;</p><p>- The National Security Analysis Centre has been established and the Director appointed;</p><p>- In 2019, approximately 600 new Garda recruits attested and were assigned to frontline policing duties nationwide. In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recruited almost 750 Garda Staff. This has allowed approximately 600 Garda&iacute; to be reassigned from administrative to frontline operational policing duties where their training and expertise can be used to best effect; and</p><p>- The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2019 has been enacted which gives Garda&iacute; access to the Workplace Relations Commission for the first time and provides for a modern industrial relations framework within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>There is also ongoing progress on legislative reform, in particular:</p><p>- Government has given approval for legislation to be drafted by my Department to underpin the use of recording devices (including body worn cameras) and for the codification of legislation defining police powers of arrest, search and detention;</p><p>- Work is well advanced in my Department on the development of the General Scheme of the Policing and Community Safety Bill to provide a new coherent framework for the governance and oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Implementation of the Plan is overseen by a dedicated Policing Reform Implementation Programme Office (PRIPO) in the Department of the Taoiseach. The Implementation Group on Policing Reform (IGPR), with Helen Ryan, former member of the Commission, as its independent Chair, has collective responsibility for the delivery of the Plan. Its core membership comprises senior officials from the organisations most closely involved in driving the reform programme &ndash; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the Department of Justice and Equality; the Department of the Taoiseach; and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Senior representatives of other relevant Departments and Agencies are also involved in this Group&rsquo;s work.</p><p>A High Level Steering Board, chaired by the Secretary General to the Government, is in place to help guide the work of the IGPR and to act as a clearing house for issues that cannot be resolved by the IGPR, or where particular blockages are being experienced in the implementation of the Plan. Cabinet Committee F provides political oversight of the implementation of the Plan.</p><p>The measures mentioned above represent only some of the wide range of actions being progressed under <i>A Policing Service for our Future</i>.

As the Deputy will appreciate, there was extensive consultation and scrutiny both within the Oireachtas and with other stakeholders in the period before enactment of the Act.  The Bill, as it was then, was amended several times as it progressed through the Houses of the Oireachtas, and these amendments considerably expanded the scope of the Bill to the extent that it was estimated at the time that approximately 80 to 85% of all criminal convictions would become spent after 7 years.</p>  <p>  However, all legislation is kept under review and I am conscious of the case for keeping the application and scope of this Act under review.  </p>  <p>  My Department is continuing work on identifying and assessing the possible implications of the recommendations of the October 2019 report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on spent convictions. My Department will also continue to carefully consider the effectiveness and balance of the Act, so that the fairest possible outcomes can be achieved for the public.</p>  <p>  In that regard, the Deputy may be aware that the Government did not oppose a Private Members Bill on this subject at Committee Stage in the Seanad in November 2019.  The Criminal Justice (Rehabilitative Periods) Bill 2018 proposed to amend and considerably extend the 2016 Act and the implications of any such changes would require careful analysis and consideration.  Whether that Bill will be reintroduced is a matter for the incoming Government to decide.  </p></reply>

Section 5 of the 1986 Act provides that a foreign divorce may only be recognised in Ireland if it was granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled on the date the divorce proceedings were instituted. The determination of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; includes an assessment of the intention of the person to remain indefinitely in the foreign jurisdiction. Recognition of foreign divorces granted prior to the coming into operation of the 1986 Act on 2 October 1986 is governed by common law domicile rules which are now consistent with those in the 1986 Act.</p>  <p>  The recognition in Ireland of a divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment granted in another EU Member State on or after 1 March 2001 is governed by EU Council Regulation 2201/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (also known as the Brussels II bis or the Brussels IIa Regulation). This Regulation provides for EU judicial co-operation and recognition and enforcement of judgments in cross-border matrimonial matters.  Under the Regulation, divorces, legal separations or marriage annulments granted in all EU States, with the exception of Denmark, are entitled to recognition if granted in accordance with jurisdictional criteria specified in the Regulation. Habitual residence is the key governing criterion for recognition. The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 no longer applies to the recognition of divorces covered by the Regulation.</p>  <p>  Where there is an issue as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition, section 29 of the Family Law Act 1995 allows a person to apply to court for a declaration as to marital status, including a declaration as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition in the State.</p>  <p>  The Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Dissolution of Marriage) Act 2019 was signed into law on 11 June 2019 following its approval by the people in a referendum on 24 May 2019.</p>  <p>  That Act deleted the following subsection from Article 41.3 of the Constitution:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; No person whose marriage has been dissolved under the civil law of any other State but is a subsisting valid marriage under the law for the time being in force within the jurisdiction of the Government and Parliament established by this Constitution shall be capable of contracting a valid marriage within that jurisdiction during the lifetime of the other party to the marriage so dissolved.&rdquo;,</p>  <p>  and substituted that subsection with the following:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; Provision may be made by law for the recognition under the law of the State of a dissolution of marriage granted under the civil law of another state.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The amendment will allow a change in the law to introduce greater consistency in the recognition of foreign divorces.  The current law on recognition of foreign divorces has remained as it is was before the Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution as The Law Reform Commission, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform, is examining recognition of foreign divorces.  When the expert report of the Law Reform Commission is completed, it will provide valuable guidance for the development of proposals for legislation to introduce greater consistency in the recognition of foreign divorces.</p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Family Law Act 2019 provided for the recognition of divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted under the law of the United Kingdom, in the event of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from membership of the European Union occurring without an agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union setting out the arrangements for such withdrawal.  As the Deputy will be aware, the UK withdrew from the EU on 31 January 2020 with such an agreement in place. Part 3 of the Family Law Act 2019 will therefore not be commenced. Issues relating to the recognition in Ireland of divorces granted in the UK after the end of the transition period are currently under consideration in my Department.</p></reply>

Under the pilot phase, five communities (Dunshaughlin, Midleton, Carrigtwohill, Kells and Lismore) welcomed refugee families to their areas. The five refugee families comprised of 17 people in total and both the refugees and local communities have reported very positive experiences. </p><p>The Community Sponsorship Ireland Programme is a complementary refugee resettlement stream to the traditional state-centred model.  The key feature of this programme is that it is based on the establishment of a group of people in a community who commit to support a family in their area.</p><p>The refugee families have been recognised as refugees by the UNHCR and arrive in Ireland following vetting and orientation organised by my Department and overseen by the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP). </p><p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established by Government Decision of September 2015 as a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s response to the global humanitarian migration crisis. It committed Ireland to accept 4,000 persons under various strands, including the EU Relocation Mechanism and UNHCR-led Resettlement Programme. As of 30 December 2019, 3,206 persons have arrived under the IRPP, inclusive of those who were resettled under the Community Sponsorship programme.</p><p>It is up to these community groups to access accommodation locally for these families and support them as they access services. All refugees are fully entitled to health, education and social welfare services, but the community groups support the families in navigating these services. </p><p>To date, eight refugee families (30 individuals) have arrived in Ireland under Community Sponsorship and have been warmly received by their host communities. A further nine<i></i>communities have been approved as Community Sponsors Groups and are now actively undergoing required training through their respective Regional Support Organisation. An additional application has been received from a community organisation and is currently awaiting recognition as a Community Sponsorship Group.</p><p>Community Sponsorship has been successfully operating in Canada for over 40 years and research from that country shows better outcomes for the refugees. The Irish model has been developed in cooperation with the Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the UNHCR and civil society organisations including the Irish Red Cross, NASC, the Irish Refugee Council and Amnesty International Ireland.  </p><p>To further promote the programme, an information leaflet was distributed to Councillors throughout the country together with an accompanying letter seeking their support in positively promoting the programme in their local communities.The information leaflet was also distributed to all TDs and Senators.  The leaflet outlines the benefits of the programme, for communities and refugees alike.</p><p>To provide supports for groups wishing to set up a Community Sponsorship Group in their area, funding is being provided for a number of Regional Support Organisations based around the country. I hope that more communities will come forward and support this rewarding initiative, which empowers refugee families and local communities alike.</p></reply>

Subject to Government formation and to reconstitution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the intention is to bring forward for Government approval, a short urgent Bill, in order to make any necessary amendments as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  Secondly, as the Deputy is aware, my officials are already working to complete the major statutory review of the Personal Insolvency Acts, following the earlier public consultation already held, and now, in addition, to ensure that this review will also take full account of the latest developments and particularly, the significant economic effects of the Covid-19  outbreak.  </p>  <p>  I expect the review report to be finalised by September, following further consultations with the Department of Finance, as required by s. 141 of the Acts, and with the Office of the Attorney General. That timetable, as the Deputy will appreciate, is of course subject to the legislative priorities that will be decided in the new Programme for Government.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters.  I am assured however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to their optimum use.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as at 30 April 2020, there are 14,714 Garda Members. This figure includes the Garda trainees from two separate intake classes who attested earlier than scheduled on Friday, 20 March, which was an operational decision taken by the Garda Commissioner in order to augment An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's response to Covid-19. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the number of Garda members changes in line with recruitment and retirements.   However to be of assistance I have can provide detail to the Deputy on the estimated cost of increasing the Garda strength by 1,000 members.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Garda management that the estimated cost of recruiting an additional 1,000 Garda members would be approximately &euro;23.3m in a full year. </p>  <p>  I should point out that the Garda authorities note that this estimated figure relates to the costs of newly attested Garda&iacute; only.   It may be noted in addition that payroll costs for new Garda recruits include a basic allowance of &euro;184 per week.  After 32 weeks of training, Garda recruits are attested and move on to the first point of the Garda pay scale. The overall estimate provided includes Employer's PRSI and an estimation of allowances which Garda members may qualify for depending on their assignments. The annual cost of these additional recruits would continue to increase as the members move up the Garda Pay scale each year. This estimated costing does not take into account any pay rises occurring after 1 January 2021. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that as of 30 April 2020, there are over 3,000 Garda staff undertaking administrative, professional, technical and industrial support duties in the organisation.  The current objective was to increase that to 4,000 in 2021.  </p>  <p>  I am informed that such staff positions range from clerical support and financial management functions to senior management, including specialised roles in HR, IT and telecommunications, as well as finance and procurement, internal audit, communications, research and analysis, accommodation, scene-of-crime support and legal and medical services.  Large numbers of Garda staff also work in key operational areas including the Central Vetting Bureau, the Information Service Centre, the Fixed Charge Processing Office and the Command and Control Centre. </p>  <p>  Bearing in mind this broad range of duties, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the estimated cost of employing an additional 2,000 Garda staff would be approximately &euro;90m in a full year, on the basis of an average estimated cost per civilian employee of approximately &euro;45,000, including employer costs such as PRSI.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that these estimated figures do not take into account the considerable additional costs that would be incurred in respect of accommodation, ICT, overtime and so on, if the Garda member and staff strengths were raised to the levels queried by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime or anti-social behaviour and to support wider preventative work within the community and with families at risk. </p>  <p>  There are currently 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects in place throughout the State. Funding ofapproximately &euro;18 million is being provided by my Department in 2020. This funding supports approximately 265 FTE youth justice worker posts, though it should be noted that this number can vary throughout the year for a variety of reasons, including leave, and the inclusion of part time workers in the figure. </p>  <p>  Considerable progress has been made in the last two years to extend the Garda Youth Diversion Project network to ensure that the service is available throughout the State.  This has been achieved by extending existing project catchment areas and allocation of additional staff.  There are a small number of areas where this approach would not be suitable and these are being considered for the establishment of new projects instead.  </p>  <p>  Catchment areas for projects are determined in consultation with local community groups, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other stakeholders on a case-by-case basis. As the GYDPs have evolved organically since their inception, catchment areas vary depending on the project&rsquo;s background and local needs.  Consequently, it is not possible to provide a standard estimate of the cost of additional projects.  </p>  <p>  It may also be noted that in recent years, the GYDP model has been developed and extended, with a renewed emphasis on family support and early intervention/preventative work, as well as on working with harder-to-engage young people, including those not suitable for the Garda Diversion Programme.  Where any new projects are being established, the minimum core of the project will now include 2 youth justice workers, a family support worker, an early intervention support worker and an outreach worker to engage with harder-to-reach young people.</p>  <p>  In relation to future policy in this area, I have chaired an expert steering group over the past twelve months to lead my Department's work developing a new Youth Justice Strategy and I expect a draft of the Strategy to be published in the near future for a further round of consultations, with a view to it being finalised and published thereafter.  </p>  <p>  The new Strategy will include a focus on how youth justice policy can more closely align to other child and youth policies, including targeted policies to support children and families who experience multiple disadvantage and links between schools and other services and programmes. A particular priority is responding effectively to the needs of the harder-to-engage cohort of children and young people.  The Strategy will include measures to address fragmentation within current services and programme delivery at local and national level so as to support a holistic response to the needs of particular children at risk, in the specific family and community context, rather than separate responses to different aspects of need at different ages and stages of the family cycle. </p></reply>

This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation. We now have over 14,700 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff. This represents the highest level of Garda personnel in the history of the organisation and these numbers are continuing to grow.   The best use of these resources including the deployment of these personnel is, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, a matter for the Garda Commissioner who holds statutory responsibility for the management and control of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

Each case is considered in the first instance by a single Tribunal Member. If the decision is appealed, three other Tribunal Members hear the appeal. Tribunal Members meet on a regular basis to hear appeals and to discuss their collective decision on appeal cases.</p>  <p>  The Tribunal's Secretariat receive applications and gather the necessary information from applicants and other relevant bodies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to each case. When all required information is available, the file is sent to the Tribunal for consideration and decision. Where a decision is appealed, Tribunal staff make arrangements for a Tribunal appeal hearing.</p>  <p>  I understand that it may take several years before an application for compensation is ready for submission to the Tribunal for consideration and decision. The duration of each case can vary depending on the nature and individual circumstances and is influenced by factors including the time involved in the provision of the required documentation to the Secretariat. For example, final Garda reports on the crime are required, as are the outcomes of any court cases initiated. </p>  <p>  In addition, in some cases, the extent of injuries suffered by the victim may not be known for some years. It is also the case that the assessment of loss of earnings for consideration by the Tribunal may be complex to determine and may require employer assessment and social welfare reports.</p>  <p>  It may be helpful to be aware that last year, 80 applicants accepted awards under the General Scheme. In 2020 to date, 102 decisions under the General Scheme have been made by Tribunal members.  It should further be noted that not all decisions result in an award. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the Law Reform Commission intends to commence a comprehensive review of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme mid-year, in a project expected to last for two years. I welcome this project as an opportunity for a comprehensive examination of all aspects of this long-established Scheme, to ensure that the State&rsquo;s arrangements for the compensation of victims of violent crime are in keeping with good international practice and meet the needs of the public into the future.</p>  <p>  In relation to the application referred to by the Deputy, I would first note that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal is entirely independent in the matter of individual decisions on applications for compensation. As Minister, I have no role in that regard. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Tribunal secretariat that they wrote to the applicant&rsquo;s legal representative on 30 January 2020 with a query on the application and issued a further reminder letter on 26 March 2020.  The secretariat advises that the application cannot be progressed further at present, pending receipt of a reply to that query. </p></reply>

The scheme permits applications not only new CCTV systems but also for extension or upgrade of existing Community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. </p><p>I must emphasise that grant funding can be considered only for CCTV systems which meet the legal requirements for CCTV, in other words CCTV systems which have been approved by the relevant Joint Policing Committee, the relevant Local Authority (also acting as Data Controller) and which have received the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>Full details of the Scheme, including guidelines, application forms, code of practice and other relevant documentation and are available to download from my Department's website,  or by emailing fundsadmin-comm-based-cctv@justice.ie</p></reply>

These unforeseen circumstances all contributed significantly to the increase in expenditure over the duration of the contract referred to.</p><p>In addition, I am advised that, in accordance with industry norms, the Irish Prison Service has sought to place greater emphasis on planned preventative maintenance and compliance with health and safety legislation such as ventilation systems, prevention of legionella, infection control measures, fire safety and noise and dust monitoring.</p><p>I am not in a position to release details of the payments by location and prison at this time.  The Irish Prison Service, in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement, is currently in the process of completing the evaluation of tenders for a new facilities management contract. I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the release of the detailed financial information would be commercially sensitive pending the successful outcome of this tender competition. </p></reply>

We are working in particular with the HSE National Social Inclusion team and following all its advice. Our centre managers are working closely with the Department, the HSE and residents to ensure that centres are safe and that guidelines on social distancing are observed.</p><p>The direction from the HSE National Social Inclusion Office is that, during the COVID crisis, non-family members sharing a room in Direct Provision centres are considered to be a household. As such, they should implement social distancing measures from other households, i.e. residents in other rooms, and self-isolate if displaying symptoms or if directed by the HSE. In such instances, we provide facilities for self-isolation both on and off-site.</p><p>We are carefully following the guidelines for our centres that have been published by the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre. These are publicly available at: .</p><p>That guidance exists precisely because it is recognised that congregated settings such as Direct Provision centres present specific challenges in this pandemic.</p><p>We are doing everything that we can to protect the health and welfare of our residents and centre staff, as well as that of the wider community. We are working closely with the HSE in doing so, and while the HSE advice has evolved over time, we have been assured by both it and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer that our approach is appropriate.</p><p>Shared bedrooms and communal living space are provided in numerous settings. Similar arrangements apply in homeless and disability services and, indeed, in private rented accommodation. </p><p>The established procedure across all centres where a person is suspected of having the virus or is confirmed as having the virus, is that, where advised by Public Health, they are moved to a dedicated offsite self-isolation facility. Supports are available for the duration of their period of isolation until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. We have opened four dedicated self-isolation facilities (with capacity for 299 people) in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Dundalk. Residents in these facilities have their own bedroom and their own bathroom. </p><p>Since the start of the year over 1,550 permanent and temporary Direct Provision bed spaces have been procured, including the dedicated new centres opened in Rosslare Harbour, Cahersiveen and Tullamore. </p><p>We have relocated over 600 residents to support social and physical distancing in centres and cocooning measures for the most vulnerable. By doing this, we have ensured that no more than three single people are sharing a room in any centre. We intend to continue this policy when the crisis is over. </p><p>The vast majority of the rooms in the new accommodation being used to support social and physical distancing are twin rooms accommodating two people. If any person is being accommodated in these locations based on an identified vulnerability (age or medical condition), they have their own bedroom and their own bathroom to facilitate their cocooning.</p><p>We have cocooned all residents over the age of 65 and anyone advised to the Department as having a serious medical illness. </p><p>During this time, centre managers have also been advised to increase the standard and frequency of cleaning throughout the centres, paying particular attention to communal areas. A regular supply of hand sanitiser for all centres is in place and this is distributed to centres as needed.</p><p>In partnership with the HSE and Safetynet, we have also put in place a national clinical telephone service to provide public health advice to support centre staff. This service will also be used to advise, support and work with those locations where vulnerable groups are present in respect of the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines and measures.</p><p>We are communicating directly with centre managers and residents via regular newsletters, which can also be found on our website www.accommodationcentres.ie. The newsletters have provided practical information on implementing social and physical distancing at this time and promoted shared learning and best practice across our network of centres. Residents have also been made aware of the need for good hand hygiene and coughing/sneezing etiquette. Information and posters have been distributed to all centres and translations of public health information have also been provided. With Ramadan underway, we have also prepared and circulated information for centre managers and residents with practical supports on observing Ramadan during the current COVID restrictions.</p><p>The website also includes information for healthcare workers on the HSE's National Guidance Document on Temporary Accommodation for Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 crisis. Healthcare workers living in Direct Provision are eligible to apply for accommodation under the scheme via a referral form to the HSE. We are encouraging all healthcare workers living in our centres to apply for this temporary accommodation for their protection and that of other centre residents and staff. We have also asked the NGO community to support this initiative and to help to bring it to the attention of residents through their support networks.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and centre managers will continue to work closely together during this time to protect the health and safety of all residents and staff as a priority.</p></reply>

The Advisory Committee will establish the criteria to be met by a legal practitioner, whether a solicitor or barrister, in order for a recommendation to be made to the Government that a patent of precedence be granted. These criteria are to be based on the objectives of ensuring that a legal practitioner seeking to have a patent granted has displayed a degree of competence and a degree of probity appropriate to, and consistent with, being granted a patent and has displayed professional independence. Candidates will also need to have displayed a professional capacity for excellence in the practice of advocacy, for excellence in the practice of specialist litigation, or, specialist knowledge of an area of law, in the manner specified under the act.</p></reply>

The Emergency Response Planning Team was tasked with identifying and issuing instruction for any necessary actions with the aim of:</p><p>- Blocking the spread of Covid-19 into a prison setting;</p><p>- Early detection of any possible case of Covid-19 in a prisoner or staff member; and</p><p>- Prevention of the spread of Covid-19, should a case be confirmed.</p><p>A significant amount of work has been carried out by the Irish Prison Service (IPS) to address this challenge, informed and guided by the advice received from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 15 March 2020 and guidance of the Council of Europe.  </p><p>A range of measures have been introduced across the prison estate in order to monitor, manage and mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in Irish prisons.  Many of these measures are based on the public health principles of early detection of cases and physical distancing to reduce the risk of Covid-19. Measures introduced have included: </p><p>- The introduction of a basic health check, including taking of temperatures for all persons, including staff, entering prisons from 29 March;</p><p>- Suspension of physical family visits, replaced by the introduction of video visits; </p><p>- Quarantining for 14 days of all newly committed prisoners, in order to reduce the risk that a new committal who might be incubating the virus could spread Covid-19 to the general prison population;</p><p>- Isolation of suspected case or prisoner with symptoms to prevent the risk of transmission of infection;</p><p>- &ldquo;cocooning&rdquo; of vulnerable prisoners including all prisoners aged 70 years or more or those that are deemed medically vulnerable;</p><p>- comprehensive training for IPS staff and the provision of appropriate PPE across the prison estate; </p><p>- strong communication with staff and prisoners, including two prison newsletters published weekly and regular Covid-19 information leaflets for prisoners and newsletters for staff regarding actions taken; and</p><p>- establishment of a robust contract tracing model which has been acknowledged by the World Health Organisation as best practice.</p><p>Due to the extensive contingency measures introduced, the ongoing dedicated work of Irish Prison Service staff as well as the cooperation and understanding of the prisoners themselves, I understand that as of yesterday, 12 May 2020, there has no confirmed prisoner case of Covid-19 within the Irish prison system.  </p><p>The number of prisoners that have been tested for Covid-19 as of 12 May, broken down by prison, is set in the following table which was conveyed to me by the Irish Prison Service.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Prison</th>       <th>Number of Prisoners Tested as of 12 May</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cloverhill</td>       <td>33</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wheatfield</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Midlands</td>       <td>16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mountjoy</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>D&oacute;chas Centre</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Portlaoise</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shelton Abbey</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Loughan House</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Castlerea</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Arbour Hill</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The number of prisoners currently in isolation, as of 12 May, due to displaying of symptoms of Covid-19, broken down by prison, is set in the following table which was conveyed to me by the Irish Prison Service.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Prison</th>       <th>Prisoners in isolation as of 12 May</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cloverhill</td>       <td>12</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wheatfield</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Midlands</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mountjoy</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dochas Centre</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Portlaoise</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shelton Abbey</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Loughan House</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Castlerea</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Arbour Hill</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

I believe it is important to point out first and foremost however that court orders in relation to access remain in place.  Everyone should understand that the restrictions brought in to tackle Covid-19 do not stop them being implemented, and should not be used as an excuse by either party.  In particular, the Regulations made by the Minister for Health, which came into effect on Wednesday 8 April, recognise the right of a parent, guardian, or person having a right of access to a child to leave their home in order to give effect to arrangements for access by that person or for another parent, guardian or person having such right of access.</p><p>Clearly, however, during this time there may be instances where it is impossible for couples to adhere strictly to the terms of an Order, and the President of the District Court recently clarified that parents could come to mutually agreed arrangements for alternative contact, which could involve phone calls, or skype etc., such agreement being noted by email or text message.</p><p>It is also important to note that if parties cannot agree on an alternative arrangement, mediation services are still available and should be used.  The Family Mediation Service of the Legal Aid Board is offering free telephone mediation and conflict coaching. More details about this service can be found at www.legalaidboard.ie, while other free parent support services which provide help and advice are available from and </p><p>With regard to maintenance and prior to the President of the District Court&rsquo;s statement 8 May, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection agreed to revise social welfare payments upwards for a 12 week period for recipients who were no longer receiving maintenance from the other parent for their child because they have lost their job due to Covid-19.  </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that setting the terms of court orders and related proceedings are matters proper to the judiciary.  Neither I nor my Department are involved in such matters.</p><p>In the current exceptional circumstances, while court offices are still open, they are only open for essential business, and by appointment only.  The Judiciary and the Courts Service have advised that the District Court will continue to hear urgent matters in all District Court Districts throughout the country as before, and will resume hearings of certain other urgent matters.  Urgent matters are now extended to include additional areas in Criminal, Family, and Child Care Law.  In the area of Family Law the President of the District Court announced 8 May changes for matters which can be dealt with.  These include the following:</p><p>- Applications and hearings for breach of maintenance or access that have occurred during the emergency period or applications and hearings for temporary guardianship orders.</p><p>- Remote call-overs and hearings may be conducted in some courts.</p><p>- Consent orders that do not require the hearing of evidence may be applied for by email by the applicant&rsquo;s solicitor exhibiting consent in writing from the respondent&rsquo;s solicitor. Following consideration by an assigned Judge orders will issue from the Court Office as appropriate without the need for the parties or their legal representatives to attend court.</p><p>According to the Practice Direction of the President of the District Court, a case which does not come into the defined urgent category can be treated as urgent if a good case can be made, and this will be decided, by the Court, on a case by case basis. The full details of the statement from the President of the District Court can be found on the website of the Courts Service at: .</p><p>I hope this information is of some help to families and I would like to emphasise that I am appealing to everyone to remember at all times that the welfare of the child is paramount.</p></reply>

In addition, a hate motive may be considered by sentencing judges as an aggravating factor increasing the sentence imposed, where a person has been found guilty of a crime such as assault.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is working to update Ireland&rsquo;s criminal law on both hate speech and hate crime as a priority.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive public consultation has been carried out to assist in this process, including a public survey and an opportunity for stakeholders to make formal submissions. This consultation has been carried out to ensure that the Department fully understands the lived experience of those impacted by hate speech and hate crime as well as the views of professionals and other stakeholders in the field, so that the laws developed are robust, clearly understood and effective in dealing with unacceptable incidents. </p>  <p>  There has been strong engagement by the public with this topic. The Department has received in the region of 3,800 written responses to the consultation, including approximately 175 detailed written submissions.</p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department has carried out comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation.  This research is currently being finalised and is expected to be published shortly. </p>  <p>  My officials are analysing all of these materials, as well as other relevant legal and policy information, to ensure that any legislative proposals which are made are evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting freedom of expression. </p>  <p>  There will be a further opportunity for stakeholders to share their views when the legislative proposals on this important issue are published for discussion. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the approach being taken - including research and providing the opportunity for experts and members of the public to provide their views through consultation - will help to ensure that the legislation we develop will deliver a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone, now as well as into the future.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also be interested to note that my Department has also been responsible for bringing forward a number of inclusion strategies which are designed to promote equality and inclusion and to tackle discrimination and prejudice, including the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy which was launched in November 2019.  The Strategy includes a number of actions relating to incidents of hate speech and hate crime and supports for victims under the fourth thematic pillar of the Strategy, which is aimed at ensuring that LGBTI+ people feel safe and supported. </p></reply>

A new entrant administrative Clerical Officer would have 22 days annual leave. An ICO works fewer days (although with a longer working day) than an administrative Clerical Officer, being rostered for seven 12-hour shifts over a 14 day period (which will include a weekend) and availing of 7 non-work days in each two week period. Generally, ICOs work no more than 3 days in a row, with at least 2 days free until their next shift. Therefore, to maintain the equivalent value of annual leave it is necessary to re-state the annual leave allowance of an ICO. </p>  <p>  The annual leave allowance of a Clerical Officer assigned as an ICO on the shift roster is 15.49 shifts per leave year.  An administrative Clerical Officer with 22 days of annual leave, on the basis of the standard gross 7 hr 24 minute working day, avails of a total of 162 hours, 48 minutes of annual leave. An ICO, availing of 15.49 shifts per leave year, with each shift being 12 hours gross in duration, avails of 185 hours and 53 minutes of annual leave. The annual leave for ICOs is not reduced: due to their shift pattern, the amount of hours leave granted exceeds that of an administrative Clerical Officer by 23 hours and 5 minutes.

My Department and centre management are working closely with the HSE to implement their public health advice.</p>  <p>  Testing of residents and staff has been completed in Cahersiveen by HSE Public Health.</p>  <p>  In line with our agreed policy with the HSE, anyone with a positive COVID-19 result has been transferred to an offsite self-isolation facility where they are cared for until such time as the HSE considers that they can safely return to their centre. The offsite facilities are supported by a non-profit (Section 39) organisation and healthcare staff. </p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to us that there should be no movement into or out of the centre at this time, unless directed by public health. Residents have been asked by the HSE to remain in the centre while they continue to monitor the situation. </p>  <p>  We know that the current restrictions are difficult for residents but the purpose of this HSE guidance is to protect the health of residents, staff and the wider community. We are working closely with the HSE and centre management to provide additional supports for residents during this time. There is a HSE Community Development Worker onsite at the centre seven days a week to monitor the health of residents. This person is supported by a wider healthcare team. Additional outdoor space has been opened up with some seating provided and, this week, exercise equipment is being set up in the outdoor area for residents&rsquo; use. Arrangements have also been made to ensure that any items residents require can be ordered from local shops and delivered to the centre. </p>  <p>  There are currently 69 residents onsite, which is well below the contracted capacity for 150 residents. The reduced occupancy is helping residents to observe social and physical distancing during this time.</p>  <p>  Guidance has been provided by the HSE to centre management on the enhanced cleaning arrangements required at this time including through an onsite visit by a HSE infection control specialist. This applies to bedrooms, corridors, staircases, the dining room, kitchen, laundry room, lift, public toilets and reception and public areas. We are advised that this is being strictly adhered to by centre management and staff.</p>  <p>  The centre is currently catered with three meals and snacks being provided to residents daily. In line with overall policy objectives the service provider plans to introduce independent living arrangements with cooking facilities for residents in the coming period. In the meantime, we have asked centre management to work with residents to find out about preferred meals and we have asked staff to source and provide ethnic snacks for residents. Kettles have been provided in rooms so that residents can make refreshments throughout the day rather than using communal facilities and meals are also being delivered to rooms. The centre has a good Wi-Fi service and phone credit has also been provided for residents so that they can keep in touch with family and friends. </p>  <p>  By way of background, in the very early stages of the pandemic, a decision was taken to move residents out of Dublin hotels, which were being used on a temporary basis but were not in the exclusive use of the Department and therefore a potential risk to residents from a public health point of view.  This relocation process was carried out in full consultation and agreement with the HSE National Social Inclusion Office, which is providing a lead to our International Protection Accommodation Service regarding public health. These residents were transferred to two accommodation centres on 18 and 19 March 2020, some eight weeks ago. I can confirm to the Deputy that no resident was awaiting testing or test results at the time the transfers were made. I can also confirm to the Deputy that the Department was not aware of any other guest at the source hotels being suspected or confirmed with the virus at the time the moves were planned or implemented.</p>  <p>  We recognise that this is a difficult time for our residents, centre staff and the wider community. Working closely with the HSE, we are committed to taking all necessary measures to protect their health and safety.</p></reply>

As soon as the Parole Act is commenced, all parole applications will be considered by new statutory Parole Board.  Prisoners who have applied under the old system but have not yet been granted parole will be eligible to be considered, once they meet the criteria set out in the Parole Act, by the new Board, in accordance with the provisions of that Act. It is, however, important to note that, in practice and over the past 10 years, the average sentence served by a life sentence prisoner before being released on parole has been approximately 19 years.</p>  <p>  There are a number of practical steps required before it will be possible to commence the Act and establish of the Parole Board, for example selection of Board members, the appointment of a Chief Executive and staff, putting in place the funding for the new Board, and various other matters, including premises for the new enlarged organisation etc. These measures will require the provision of additional funding in Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to seeing the new Parole Board up and running and soon as is practically possible. The legislation to establish the new Board is complex and a significant amount of planning is taking place to allow for its establishment.  A Project Board has been established in my Department to carry out the necessary work and ensure that all necessary arrangements are made.  Pending establishment of the new Board, the existing expert Parole Board is continuing with its work.</p></reply>

I want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic growth.</p>  <p>  Enterprise development and sustainable job creation in the regions is a key policy priority of this Government. A total of 26,700 more people in the South-East are in employment in Q4 2019 than in Q1 2015 when the Regional Action Plan for Jobs started, and unemployment in the South East has reduced from 11.7 percent to 6.8 percent in the same period. </p>  <p>  I launched the South-East Regional Enterprise Plan in March 2019, one of nine new regional plans that build on the previous Regional Action Plans for Jobs. The South-East Plan has focused on a number of  Strategic Objectives: building enterprise resilience; marketing the region; a regional engagement strategy on key infrastructure priorities; ensuring the South East is a learning region; and tourism growth. The Plan has commenced implementation, led by the Regional Steering Committee involving the Local Authorities, Enterprise Agencies, LEOs, tourism bodies, HEIs, ETBs, and others. </p>  <p>  While we have had very good success to date through the Regional Enterprise Plan in reducing unemployment; in the context of Brexit and other global challenges we need to also focus on the creation of quality and sustainable jobs. My Department's Future Jobs Ireland initiative launched early last year with the Department of the Taoiseach, is our plan to meet these challenges. It includes ambitious targets and actions to drive this transformation of our economy. </p>  <p>  In 2019, the South-East has 70 IDA Ireland supported companies employing 12,213 people, up 1.5% from 2018. The IDA will continue to work to identify opportunities for new investment or expansion in the South-East, promoting the region's existing concentrations of pharma, MedTech, financial services, AgriTech and high-value manufacturing activities. </p>  <p>  In 2019, there were 19,868 people employed in 459 Enterprise Ireland supported companies in the South-East, up 2.5% from 2018. 'Powering the Regions' is Enterprise Ireland's new regional plan which sets out the focus of its activities regionally, including for the South East. There was also a net increase of 360 jobs supported by the South East LEOs during 2019.</p>  <p>  The Government has put several funding streams in place to support regional development and the South-East has seen a number of successes under my own Department&rsquo;s regional funding streams.  These include over &euro;12.1m under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), &euro;377,520 under the Regional Technology Clustering Fund and &euro;345,320 under the LEO Competitive Fund.</p>  <p>  Guided by the Regional Enterprise Plan, and with all regional stakeholders working together, the South-East is well positioned to realise its enterprise potential and see better quality, sustainable jobs and investment.</p></reply>

Where a Department or state body fails to comply with these regulations, that is if a payment is made later than 30 days, then they are in breach of these regulations an must automatically pay to the supplier compensation (a minimum of &euro;40) and late payment interest for every day they are late. So, if a Government Department or state body does not pay a supplier for 90 days they must pay 60 days of late payment interest to that supplier, as well as the compensation payment. Departments and state bodies report on payments which have taken longer than 30 days. My Department does not receive information on the number of late days in excess of the 30-day limit.  </p>  <p>  The interest and compensation rates applied are in line with the Directive. Late payment interest is currently set at 8% (daily rate of 0.022%), on the outstanding balance of the payment.  This rate of interest is in line with the requirements of the Directive and is also in line with interest rates applied by other Member States.  The supplier is also entitled to compensation at a minimum rate of &euro;40 in line with the Directive.</p>  <p>  Compliance level among Government Departments is very strong. In 2018 2019 98% of all invoices received by Government Departments were paid within 30 days and did not incur late payment interest or compensation. In 2018 and 2019, 99% and 98% of all invoices received by the agencies of this Department were paid within 30 days and therefore did not incur late payment interest or compensation payments.</p></reply>

We have seen strong demand for the scheme since its launch in April 2019 across all sectors and regions including in exporting businesses and family businesses.</p><p>Up to 4 May, there has been a total of 3,449 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 3,286 have been approved for eligibility under the scheme. The initial &euro;300m funding for the FGLS has been almost fully subscribed, supporting a significant level of strategic investment by businesses. On 8 April, I announced a further expansion of this scheme and my Department is now working through the details of a significant expansion to bring this funding to market as soon as possible.</p><p>New &euro;2,500 Business Continuity Voucher. This Voucher is available through Local Enterprise Offices and is designed for businesses across every sector that employ up to 50 people. It can be used by companies to develop short-term and long-term strategies to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>These measures are in addition to the &euro;150m of funding capacity in the Government&rsquo;s Credit Guarantee Scheme. </p><p>For microenterprises with under 10 employees, I am providing Microfinance Ireland (MFI), which is administering special COVID-19 Loans, with an additional &euro;13m in capital support bringing its total lending capacity up to &euro;20m for the coming period. There is also a substantial reduction in interest rates on these loans from 7.8% to 4.5%. Loans can be made up to &euro;50,000 with no repayments required and no interest charged in the first six months.</p><p>In addition, I have expanded the &euro;2,500 Trading Online Voucher Scheme for microenterprises, with an additional &euro;3.3m being provided to the scheme bringing the total available to &euro;5.6m, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Communications and Climate Action. The scheme is also being made more flexible - allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one; and allowing subscriptions to low-cost online retailing platform solutions to quickly establish a retailing presence online.</p><p>&euro;180m Sustaining Enterprise Fund. This is specifically aimed at all firms with 10 or more employees in the manufacturing and international services sectors impacted by COVID-19 that are vulnerable but viable. The Fund will be operated by Enterprise Ireland, providing repayable advances of up to &euro;800,000 as agreed with the EU under new State Aid rules and, together with leveraged lending from the financial markets, should see up to &euro;500m of additional investment in vulnerable but viable firms. These grants will only be repayable if and when a business returns to financial good health.</p><p>Help for Business planning:</p><p>&middot;Business Financial Planning Grant from Enterprise Ireland to the value of &euro;5,000 to assist companies to develop a Business Sustainment Plan and to engage the services of an approved Financial ConsultantOnline Retail Scheme</p><p>.A new &euro;2m Online Retail Scheme from Enterprise Ireland will be open to retailers employing over 10 people. The objective of the Scheme is to support companies in the indigenous retail sector with a pre-existing online presence to respond to both the domestic and international consumer demand for a competitive online offer. Grants ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;40,000 will be awarded under the competitive scheme.  </p><p>On Saturday 2 May last, I also announced a further suite of measures to support small, medium and larger business that are negatively impacted by Covid-19 with Minister Paschal Donohoe, T.D., Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and Minister Eoghan Murphy, T.D.,  Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. This package of support followed the publication of the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society &amp;amp; Business, which sets out a five-stage plan to ease the Covid-19 restrictions and reopen Ireland&rsquo;s economy and society. The new measures we announced included:</p><p>- A &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates/waiver rebate from 2019;</p><p>- A three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms;</p><p>- A &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates;</p><p>- The &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax liabilities for a period of twelve months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt; and,</p><p>- A commitment to local authorities to make up the rates shortfall, so that local authorities can continue provide full services to the public.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19. </p></reply>

The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme is offered by my Department in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee facility. The scheme is operated by the SBCI. It currently makes available a fund of up to &euro;200m to eligible businesses that have been negatively affected by impacts arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 to enable those businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to the current business environment. </p>  <p>  Following my further announcement on April 8 this Scheme is now being expanded to make available an additional &euro;250 million in lending, which will bring the total amount of lending available under this scheme to &euro;450 million.</p>  <p>  The current Credit Guarantee Scheme aims to assist viable SMEs, which under normal lending criteria are unable to borrow from their bank, in accessing credit. The scheme operates by providing an 80% guarantee to participating finance providers (currently AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank) on qualifying facilities to SMEs.</p>  <p>  On 2 May, I announced a &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from 3 months to 6 years, which will be below market interest rates.

The report is an insightful and interesting piece of work which my Department actively contributed to during its development.</p>  <p>  The vision of the report is to ensure that Ireland, in the face of economic changes, is a resilient, sustainable, thriving net zero economy that uses innovation and collective preparedness to shape the future that we all want to achieve. The goals outlined in the report, such as encouraging the State to drive the creation of a high-quality jobs economy and proactively addressing employment vulnerability, are fundamental aspects of the work that we do in my Department. </p>  <p>  My Department is reviewing the report and its recommendations in detail for a national approach to achieving a Just Transition, both in the shifts toward increased digitalisation and a low carbon economy. I believe that it will be important to ensure that any national approach to transition is closely connected to the regions and the communities affected. As such, my Department has already engaged with the Just Transition Commissioner for the Midlands both directly and through the agencies and offices in the Midlands.</p>  <p>  My Department is already engaged in a number of the activities outlined in the report as being key drivers of the response to Just Transition. In particular, the work that this Department has done to date on building resilient enterprises and advocating for continuous pre-emptive workforce development, will aid smoother transitions in the future. In addition, both embracing innovation and technological change and transitioning to a low carbon economy were key pillars of Future Jobs 2019 and progress was achieved on a number of ambitions and deliverables in these areas.  The challenge ahead will be to build on this work to aid the transition to increasingly digitalised and low carbon economy.</p></reply>

I wanted an external view of how our SME sector is performing, the strengths and weaknesses of our indigenous businesses, where the relevant programmes are working, and where we may need to consider policy changes. </p>  <p>  My Department played a central role throughout the process, organising stakeholder events enabling detailed engagement between DBEI, other Government Departments, agencies, academia, business representatives, and the small business sector. This allowed the OECD to gain valuable insight into our small business ecosystem at the various critical stages of the Review. </p>  <p>  This Review, which I published in October 2019, provides pivotal new research examining the policy environment for SMEs and entrepreneurship in Ireland, the scale of which has not been delivered before.</p>  <p>  Since then, I have been working with my Department officials on how best to progress implementation of the key recommendations outlined in the OECD Review, with a view to the adoption of a national SME and Entrepreneurship Strategy. Specific recommendations made regarding the development of mechanisms to assist SMEs and entrepreneurs in such areas as lifelong learning, financial management and digital skills have never been more imperative to the future of our entrepreneurial ecosystem than now. </p>  <p>  The current crisis reminds us of the importance of these objectives and the challenging circumstances which have been thrust upon our small business sector by the current Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The significant work undertaken during the Review is assisting my Department&rsquo;s ability to respond and put in place measures to ensure businesses have sufficient liquidity to see them through this crisis. A major part of my Department&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been to expand access to finance supports to ensure businesses have sufficient liquidity to see them through these current highly challenging circumstances.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt that our strong relationships with SME stakeholders, which we relied upon during the OECD Review engagement and more recently in our continuing response to the Covid-19 pandemic, will prove informative and beneficial to the delivery of future policy in the SME and Entrepreneurship sector for Ireland. </p>  <p>  The formation and implementation of all policy related initiatives, including that of an SME and Entrepreneurship Strategy, will be addressed in the context of a new Programme for Government by the incoming Government.</p>  <p>  I have and will continue to advocate on behalf of our SMEs. I remain committed to using all available tools currently at my disposal to support our small business ecosystem in all regions across the country.</p></reply>

The suite of enterprise and finance supports in place cover the spectrum of potential Brexit impacts and aims to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s suite of Brexit supports includes preparedness vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, tariff advisory services, research on new markets and innovation supports through Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTradeIreland. Supports and advice are also available from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, IDA Ireland, Revenue, Skillnet Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Bord Bia and F&aacute;ilte Ireland. </p><p>Of my Department's suite of supports, the &euro;300m <b>Brexit Loan Scheme</b>is designed to address working capital challenges brought about by Brexit. The Brexit Loan Scheme provides affordable working capital to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees that are or will be Brexit impacted and which meet the scheme criteria.  The &euro;23 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged through the European Investment Fund (EIF) InnovFin guarantee to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million over the lifetime of the scheme. </p><p>The scheme features a two-stage application process. First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. The SBCI assesses the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number.</p><p>Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers using their eligibility reference number. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures.  </p><p><b>The Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS)</b>was launched in April 2019 to provide for &euro;300m in longer- term lending to SMEs, mid-caps and farmers. The scheme leverages &euro;62 million of State funding (&euro;37 million from DBEI and &euro;25 million from DAFM) with a further &euro;1 million payable in management fees to the European Investment Fund (which is part of the EIB Group). Based on the contribution by DAFM to the scheme, a target of 40% of total lending is geared to farmers and the food sector.</p><p>The FGLS is delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) through participating finance providers. The SBCI provides an uncapped guarantee of 80% to the participating financial providers. The scheme is underpinned by a 64% counter-guarantee to the SBCI from the EIF. This counter-guarantee provides significant risk protection to the Exchequer against potential losses from the loan guarantee scheme.  </p><p>The uptake of the scheme has significantly surpassed expectations, such that the initial &euro;300m funding for the FGLS scheme has been almost fully subscribed, supporting a significant level of strategic investment by businesses. One of the participating financial providers lenders has remaining capacity and businesses seeking loan approval are being directed towards this lender. </p><p>On 8 April, I announced that this scheme would be expanded by a further &euro;200m to facilitate longer-term lending to Covid-19-impacted businesses and my Department is working through the details of this expansion and will bring this funding to market as soon as possible.</p><p>The<b>Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs)</b>have organised workshops, seminars and training to assist companies to better understand the challenges of Brexit and have a range of supports to help clients to respond to those challenges, to become more competitive, and to source new markets. </p><p>The main Brexit supports available for micro and small companies available through the LEOs include:</p><p>- A &lsquo;<b>Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rsquo; grant</b>designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities. </p><p>- A &lsquo;<b>Lean for Micro&rsquo;</b>programme available nationwide to help small businesses become more efficient and competitive. </p><p>- Tailored mentoring to address Brexit related business challenges.</p><p><b>- Targeted training on specific Brexit challenges</b>, including financial aspects and capability building in innovation, competitiveness and opportunity diagnosis. </p><p>- Provision of <b>customs training workshops</b>in locations across the country</p><p>Notwithstanding the difficulty&rsquo;s businesses are currently experiencing during the COVID-19 crisis, it is worth noting that businesses still recognise the importance of preparing for Brexit. However, the uptake of LEO Brexit Supports has seen a decline on last year&rsquo;s figures since the intervention of COVID -19 as business are implementing new strategies on how to continue their business amidst public health concerns. Nationally and regionally, the 31 local LEO offices continue to provide information, advice and guidance.</p><p><b>Enterprise Ireland</b>has developed and launched a number of supports and initiatives to assist companies to navigate the challenges and opportunities posed by Brexit including the following:</p><p>- <b>Brexit Scorecard:</b>an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars. 7,160<b></b>Brexit Scorecards have been completed to date.</p><p><b>- Be Prepared Grant</b>: designed for Enterprise Ireland clients who would benefit from further research and external expertise in examining their exposure to Brexit and exploring ways of addressing this. The grant supports the costs of SME clients up to &euro;5k in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit. 251<b></b>Be Prepared Grants have been approved to date.</p><p><b>- Act On Programme:</b><i></i>has been developed to focus on three main areas of capability (1) Financial and Currency Management (2) Strategic Sourcing and (3) Customs and Logistics.

InterTradeIreland also offers two Brexit Vouchers. The first of these is a Brexit Planning voucher which provides 100% financial support towards professional advice to help Businesses identify Brexit exposures and to plan. </p><p>The second is a Brexit Implementation voucher, which provides financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 to allow businesses to implement critical changes, making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship post-Brexit. InterTradeIreland pays 50% of the cost of this voucher. </p><p>As well support through voucher funding, the Brexit Advisory Service also offer a tailor-made on-line learning tool, a tariff checker, glossary of key Brexit terminology, research, networking and information events.</p><p>My Department, in association with the Department of Education and Skills and key industry partners, also have a support measure to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses develop the capacity to deal with the additional customs requirements due to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. The initiative called Clear Customs comprises of a training programme and a customs financial support to assist with the costs of recruiting and assigning new staff to customs roles.</p><p>In addition, the Government has held over 100 Brexit information seminars and events. I have convened roundtable discussions with the main retail grocery and distribution players to better understand contingency planning within the sector on food supply. Revenue, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, Dublin Port and relevant Government Departments also attend these meetings.</p><p>The continued uncertainty around Brexit continues to represent a significant challenge for businesses in Ireland already under pressure from the Covid-19 pandemic. I want businesses, particularly those most impacted by Brexit and Covid-19, to know my Department and its agencies are here to help. <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme</th>       <th>Uptake at 5 May 2020 (except where otherwise noted)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Brexit Loan Scheme</td>       <td>1,085   eligibility applications received, of which 967 have been approved, 24 deemed ineligible and 94 in process.  256 loans have been sanctioned at bank level to the value of &euro;52.2 million (as of 24th of April 2020)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Future Growth Loan Scheme</td>       <td>3,364   eligibility applications received, of which 3,197 have been approved, 15 deemed ineligible and 149 in   process. 1,041 loans have been sanctioned at bank level to the value of &euro;221.3 million (with a further &euro;86.9 million in the pipeline for sanctioning) (as of 24th of April 2020)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit </td>       <td>7,160 Brexit Scorecards have been completed. 1,848 LEO clients have completed the scorecard.</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant</td>       <td>251 Be Prepared Grants have been approved</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new markets</td>       <td>248 Companies have been approved under this initiative</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Prepare to Export Scorecard</td>       <td>7,423 Prepare to Export Scorecard users</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Customs Insights Online Course</td>       <td>2,012 Customs Insights Course participants</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding</td>       <td>100 Agile Innovation projects have been approved</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics</td>       <td>16 Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with over 1,200 in attendance</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit  &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience</td>       <td>370 Act On plans have been completed</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic   consultant for a set period</td>       <td>1,114 Strategic Consultancy Grants have been approved</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland Clear Customs Grant</td>       <td>214 companies have been approved financial support under this initiative</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office Technical Assistance Grant for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities</td>       <td>1,003   clients were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant as   of the 30th April 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients</td>       <td>577 LEO clients have participated in the programme as of the 30th April 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring</td>       <td>1,438 mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit as of the 30th April 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office Brexit Seminars/Events </td>       <td>7,299 participants at the Brexit Information events as of the 30th April 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Customs Training Participants</td>       <td>1,824   participants attended Customs Training as of the 30th April 2020</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>InterTradeIreland Brexit   Advisory Service</td>       <td>415 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2020.

Under the terms of this SLA, the ICRR committed to fund all maintenance, repairs, fuel and other expenses incurred in the provision of the transportation element of the service, while the National Ambulance Service (NAS) committed to provide the clinical staff and consumables. It was never envisaged that Exchequer funding would be required, or would be available, to subvent the ICRR service. The decision to proceed with the service arrangement was contingent on the contribution of the charity to the cost of the operation of the service.</p>  <p>  The position is that at this stage it would not be possible to provide funding to the ICRR to continue to operate the service. Any decision to provide exchequer funding would be dependent on detailed consideration by the NAS/HSE and the Department of Health of the service need and potential costs.  Such a decision would also be subject to public procurement rules.</p>  <p>  I understand that ICRR has advised the NAS that they intend to continue to provide the service on a five-day basis for an interim period. This is welcomed, as is the NAS&rsquo;s commitment to continue to engage with ICRR on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

The Minister for Health is accountable to the Oireachtas for implementation and will report regularly on progress. The Cabinet Committee on Health, chaired by the Taoiseach will provide overall strategic direction and will oversee implementation, ensuring leadership at the highest level.</p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office was established in the Department of Health, and drives the implementation of the Strategy. The office is led by an Executive Director, and is resourced with a team to deliver the reform programme. The Office has established the programme of reform as approved by Government and has begun to put in place the governance arrangements, processes, structures and resources to implement the reform across 2018 and 2019.</p><p>The goal of the agreed Oireachtas all-party 10-year plan for Sl&aacute;intecare is to enable the delivery of the Right Care, in the Right Place at the Right Time by the Right Team, at low or no cost. The 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan set out detailed timeframes for 138 projects that were to be progressed in 2019, as the first full year in the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision, and firmly established a programmatic approach to the delivery of the Sl&aacute;intecare strategy. Of the 138 projects for the period up to December 2019, 112 were on track, 24 have been progressed with minor challenges, and 2 with significant challenge. This work has been carried out by many stakeholders, including from the Department of Health, the HSE, the voluntary and community bodies and key partners. It represents a concerted effort to deliver on the all-party vision and provides a strong foundation for moving forward into 2020, and beyond.</p><p><b>Foundational Decisions in 2019</b></p><p>During 2019, a series of important Sl&aacute;intecare reform Government decisions have been made, including the agreement:</p><p>1. on the geographies for the six new regional health areas which is a first major step towards restructuring our health services in line with recommendation in the Oireachtas Committee report, which is informing the development of a detailed business case for consideration by Government;</p><p>2.to support the findings of the Independent Review Group established to examine private activity in public hospitals with the decision and announcement that all future consultant appointments, from mid-2020, will be to the new Sl&aacute;intecare Consultant contract for public only work;</p><p>3. on revised GP contractual arrangements in April 2019, which will see a &euro;210 million investment (40% increase) in General Practice over the next four years of which &euro;80 million will be available for the management of chronic diseases, like diabetes and COPD, through family doctors. This is expected to benefit more than 400,000 patients; </p><p>4. on the strengthening of the HSE with the formal appointment of the Health Service Executive (HSE) Board in June 2019 and the introduction of a new HSE Chief Executive Officer.  </p><p>Moving into the second full year of implementation and building on the foundations put in place in 2019, the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme will work on three priority reform programmes for 2020.  These programmes are carefully planned to be delivered over a number of years, and will: </p><p>- continue the reorganisation of the HSE into Regional Health Areas, which will deliver integrated patient-centred services that are safe, local and fairly distributed;</p><p>- implement the recommendations of the Capacity Review 2018, encompassing both investment, as well as resource optimisation which will reduce waiting times and develop extra capacity for population growth in the health and social care system; and </p><p>- examine the eligibility and entitlement to health and social care services of our citizens to make sure cost is not a barrier to getting care in a timely manner.</p><p>The past year has seen the delivery of the majority of actions committed for 2019, the first full year of the ten-year Sl&aacute;intecare strategy. To succeed, Sl&aacute;intecare requires the long-term commitment of targeted and protected funding and support to enable the delivery of the reform programme. This funding will be invested strategically and will support the overall vision for reform, with a consistent focus on effectiveness, efficiency and value for money. In parallel, with Government commitment to funding, there is a requirement on all parts of the health delivery system to optimise the use of the scarce resources already made available to it.

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the scheme at this time. However, I wish to inform the Deputy that it is proposed that the LTI Scheme would be included as part of a review of the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  For people who are not eligible for the LTI Scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;124 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. </p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations. </p></reply>

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p><p>As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019, the HSE approved 31 new medicines (including  ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) on a patient specific basis) and 5 new indications for existing medicines for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. These approvals represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients.  </p><p>Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.</p><p>The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.</p><p>My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. </p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines. These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars. </p><p>I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  The NHSS budget for 2020 has increased by &euro;70m over its 2019 budget.</p>  <p>  At present, the capital value of an individual's principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three year cap. This cap does not apply to productive assets such as farms and businesses except in cases of sudden illness or disability where  specific conditions are met.</p>  <p>  Rental income, including income arising from the rental of a farm, is considered income for the purpose of the financial assessment, and is assessed at 80% less any allowable deductions. Allowable deductions include income tax and, therefore, any income tax arising from rental income should be deducted; other deductions include some health expenses, levies required by law to be paid, and interest on some loans in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence.</p>  <p>  The proposed policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government. The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the Amendment to the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme on 13 November 2019. Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Department's ongoing work to respond to the challenges arising as a result. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period.</p>  <p>  As an element of this question is in relation to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy on this element as soon as possible.</p></reply>

They share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action. Hydroxychloroquine is licensed in Ireland for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, and dermatological conditions caused or aggravated by sunlight.  It is not licensed for the treatment of COVID-19. There are no medicinal products containing chloroquine phosphate authorised for the Irish market. </p><p>The COVID-19 Evidence Review Group (ERG) for Medicines was established to support the HSE in managing the significant amount of information on treatments for COVID-19. This COVID- 19 Evidence Review Group is comprised of evidence synthesis practitioners from across the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE), Medicines Management Programme (MMP) and the National Medicines Information Centre (NMIC). The group respond to queries raised via the Office of the HSE Chief Clinical Officer, National Clinical Programmes and the Department of Health and respond in a timely way with the evidence review supporting the query.</p><p>The Evidence Review Group undertook a rapid evidence review of antiviral therapies in the treatment of Covid-19. In vitro, pre-clinical studies have suggested that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may be effective treatments for Covid-19. However, emerging clinical evidence is increasingly showing a lack of significant clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers have registered hundreds of clinical trials for COVID-19, many of which are actively recruiting. COVID-19 trials need to be well designed and adequately powered to generate robust evidence. A number of large, international clinical trials of investigational treatments for COVID-19 (including hydroxychloroquine) are underway in Europe. These include the Solidarity trial, the REMAP-CAP trial and the Discovery trial. </p><p>Based on the best evidence available, at present, prescribing of antivirals for the management of patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease should be restricted to hospitals only. Therefore, any use of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of Covid-19 is restricted to use in hospital settings and in line with the recommended guidance in the Clinical Management of Acute Respiratory Infection with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).</p><p><i></i><i>.</i></p><p>Chloroquine is not listed for use in this guidance.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The professions of occupational therapist and speech and language therapist are amongst the professions CORU regulates. It is a criminal offence for a person who is not registered with CORU to use a professional title protected under the Act. </p>  <p>  Having received complaints from members of the public, CORU conducted an investigation of the directors of a facility (details supplied). This facility was not a HSE centre but was a centre offering certain health services in a private capacity.</p>  <p>  Following its investigations, CORU was satisfied that certain persons working in the facility were not registered with CORU but were using protected titles. CORU sought a High Court injunction requiring the individuals in question to cease and desist from using the titles while unregistered with CORU. The Directors provided undertakings to the High Court, including that they would cease and desist from using the titles in contravention of the Act and would inform all previous and existing clients that at no time while providing services in the State were they entitled to use the titles.  CORU has also instituted criminal proceedings against the individuals involved; these proceedings are due to take place in Cork District Court later this year.</p>  <p>  Since 2016, there has been a sizeable investment in the reform and improvement of children&rsquo;s disability services in Ireland.  As part of Transforming Lives, the HSE is currently implementing the &ldquo;Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme (2009)&rdquo;. This programme requires a reconfiguration of all current HSE and HSE funded children&rsquo;s disability services into geographically-based children&rsquo;s disability network teams. The overall aim is to achieve a national equitable approach to service provision for all children based on their individual need - regardless of their disability, where they live or where they go to school. Services will be provided through the children&rsquo;s disability networks across each of nine Community Healthcare Organisations, comprising of specialist multi-disciplinary teams to work with complex disability needs.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Strategy&rsquo;s key aims are to improve sexual health and well-being and to reduce negative sexual health outcomes.  A mid-term review of the Strategy, conducted in 2018, found that implementation is going well and that the Strategy will remain relevant beyond 2020. It is planned to develop a refreshed version of the strategy.</p><p>A number of priority actions under the Strategy were significantly progressed in 2019. A national HIV PrEP prevention programme was commenced in November 2019, and funding of &euro;5.4 million allocated to the HSE in Budget 2020 for full national roll-out this year.  In addition, last year, Ireland joined the Fast Track Cities Initiative, a global partnership project to drive the response to HIV/AIDS, including action on awareness, outreach and community HIV testing, and stigma reduction.</p><p>Supports for accessing contraception is provided through the GMS scheme, GP visit cards and the National Condom Distribution Service (NCDS), which was established by the HSE Sexual Health &amp;amp; Crisis Pregnancy Programme in October 2015. </p><p>The NCDS functions as a central point of distribution of free condoms and lubricant sachets to HSE services and other organisations who work directly with people at an increased risk of negative sexual health outcomes.  In 2018, 409,000 condoms were ordered by 67 organisations working directly with individuals and groups across the country who are at increased risk of unplanned pregnancy or acquiring HIV or an STI.  The NCDS commenced roll-out of condom dispenser services in third level colleges and universities in 2019 to provide further sexual health supports to young people.</p><p>The HSE has developed a number of  safer sex, contraception and consent messaging resources which are accessible online via the website <i>.</i></p><p>A Working Group was established in April 2019 to consider the range of policy, regulatory and legislative issues arising in relation to improving access to contraception in Ireland.The Group&rsquo;s report, which was published in October 2019, identified the barriers that exist to accessing contraception and the mechanisms available to overcome those barriers. It is clear that there is a sizeable body of work to be addressed in order to develop policy and legislative proposals and then to ensure the implementation of service delivery arrangements.</p></reply>

These reimbursement criteria are comprehensive and must all be carefully considered by the HSE when reimbursement decisions are under consideration, particularly as many of these reimbursement decisions represent multi-million euro investments by the State. </p>  <p>  Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that it has received two applications for the reimbursement of osimertinib (Tagrisso): </p>  <p>  1) The treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  In May 2018, the NCPE recommended that osimertinib not be considered for reimbursement for this indication unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments. The application has had a positive recommendation from the HSE Drugs Committee and is currently under consideration by the HSE in line with the 2013 Health Act.  </p>  <p>  2) The first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. </p>  <p>  In respect of this indication, a health technology assessment was completed on 6 August 2019 with the NCPE recommending that osimertinib not be considered for reimbursement unless cost effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.

These Codes of Practice were developed in collaboration with the food industry, and the Department had good engagement with the industry during this process.  I expect that this engagement will continue in the future.</p>  <p>  The process of setting up an implementation and monitoring framework for the Codes of Practice is one which has taken longer than expected with respect to determining the most robust monitoring mechanism to preserve the integrity of the implementation of the Codes for the benefit of public nutritional health.  A particular issue with this is the challenge involved in regulating the digital environment, given the sophisticated and rapidly developing techniques which can be used in marketing, including to children.</p>  <p>To progress the Department&rsquo;s work in this area, Ireland is participating in a Joint Action under the 3rd EU Health Programme called Best ReMaP (which stands for Best practice in Reformulation, Marketing and Public Procurement).  Ireland will be co-leading on one of the Work Packages under the Joint Action, on &ldquo;Best Practices in the field of marketing of unhealthy foods to children and adolescents&rdquo;.  Among the key objectives of this are: to develop effective policies to reduce the exposure of children to unhealthy food marketing, and to deliver protocols and tools to measure the reduction in the marketing of unhealthy food to children, with a particular focus on digital marketing and health inequalities.  Seventeen EU countries will be participating in this Work Package and this sharing of expertise and experience is expected to be greatly beneficial in informing Ireland&rsquo;s overall approach to implementing and monitoring the Codes of Practice.</p>  <p>  The Joint Action application is awaiting final approval from the EU Commission.  This was delayed due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 crisis, but it is hoped that approval will be received in the coming weeks.  It is expected that work under the Joint Action will commence in September 2020.</p></reply>

The commitment is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p><p>Under the <i>New Directions</i>day service policy, all HSE funded Day Services are expected to be provided on an equitable basis, while also ensuring that the use of finite resources is maximised. There is a strong overlap between the day supports now provided as part of the New Directions approach and the programmes being offered by Rehabilitative Training. </p><p>The clear policy rationale of not making the Rehabilitative Training bonus payment to new entrants is to ensure access to high quality services to those who need them, on an equitable basis.  Since September 2019, new entrants no longer receive the bonus payment, in line with those attending similar training programmes. </p><p>Individuals already in receipt of the bonus payment  will continue to receive it for the duration of their course. Most people with disabilities are now in receipt of the Disability Allowance (&euro;203 per week) paid through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. </p><p>The savings made from the phasing out of the Bonus payment are ring fenced to facilitate  provision of additional full and part time day placements nationally, based on priority need. </p><p>The HSE has advised the Department that in the period from September to 31<sup>st</sup>December 2019, 22 additional full-time placements and 19 additional part time placements were funded by the redirected monies. Each of these places has enhanced the lives of people, and their families.  Enhanced service hours are enabling service users to be part of their local communities and enjoy greater choices about how they spend their time, while providing valuable social opportunities for families. In addition, adults who were heretofore not in receipt of any service are now engaging with their communities and experiencing new opportunities, having previously been socially isolated.</p><p>The cost of restoring the allowance would be c. &euro;4m over 4 years, and in addition to this an alternative funding stream would be required for the day service placements already funded, and for those identified for a place in the coming months.  Furthermore, the reintroduction of an allowance solely for RT programme attendees will create inequality, given that other training courses and services delivering similar programmes  will not receive it. </p></reply>

The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. </p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations. </p></reply>

This is in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family commitments. </p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures will help make general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors. </p>  <p>  In relation to the GP retirement from Nangor Medical Centre, as this is a service issue I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to this matter.</p></reply>

There are 165 recommendations contained in the review and most of these relate to amendments to the Mental Health Act. Of these 165 recommendations, 13 relate explicitly to children.  The Review includes provisions which are intended to strengthen the protections for people who are detained without consent in approved centres. The broad thrust of the changes recommended by the Expert Group has been accepted and Government approval was given for the drafting of a General Scheme of a Bill to amend the existing legislation to reflect the recommendations of the Expert Group. </p>  <p>  Progress on the comprehensive updating of the 2001 Act has been delayed in part because of the need to progress a number of Private Members Bills over the past four years, as well a requirement for emergency legislation to cure a finding of unconstitutionality of section 15(3) of the 2001 Act.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Health finalised a draft of heads of a bill, based on the recommendations of the Expert Group Review, in July 2019. This, along with a section specifically relating to children, was then sent to the Mental Health Commission for its consideration. It is essential that the Mental Health Commission, which has a very significant and important role in overseeing the safeguards provided in the Act, has full input into the framing of the many amendments to be included in revised mental health legislation, including the amendments related to children. The Department expects to receive detailed observations from the Commission on the section of the bill related to children in the coming months, on top of the recently-received observations on the other sections of the bill. In addition, a preliminary meeting between Department of Health officials, Department of Children and Youth Affairs officials and the Mental Health Commission took place in February 2020 on the draft heads of bill related to children. </p>  <p>  It is planned that all elements of the new legislation, including the section relating to children, will be introduced at the same time when finalised.</p></reply>

There has been considerable ongoing progress by that Department in providing accessible public transport nationally<i></i>including a public consultation launched in November last, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport. </p><p>As part of Budget 2019, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection commissioned a <i>Cost of Disability Study which is </i>currently underway.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs, from a whole of Government perspective. </p><p>A Working Group, chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality, has been convened to progress Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy. Action 104 provides for &lsquo;<i>a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources. </i>Importantly, this Working Group brings together the key stakeholders and it is hoped that the work of the Group will also inform policy development to enable the most efficient use of available transport resources for persons with disabilities. </p></reply>

The 2013 Act does not give the Minister for Health any powers in this regard.  The HSE does not require approval or consent from the Minister or Government when making a reimbursement decision.  As Minister for Health, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual cases.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE, the company must submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that it has received two applications for the reimbursement of Osimertinib (Tagrisso): </p>  <p>  1) The treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  In May 2018, the NCPE recommended that osimertinib not be considered for reimbursement for this indication unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments. The application has had a positive recommendation from the HSE Drugs Committee and is currently under consideration by the HSE in line with the 2013 Health Act.  </p>  <p>  2) The first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. </p>  <p>  In respect of this indication, a health technology assessment was completed on 6 August 2019 with the NCPE recommending that Osimertinib not be considered for reimbursement unless cost effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments. The HSE will assess this application for reimbursement in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

It covers a ten year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. It must be emphasised that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this.</p>  <p>  An Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group (OPIOG) was established in October 2017 and the progress report on each recommendation in the OPAP is currently being finalised under the aegis of the OPIOG.  The progress report is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to finalise it in the near future, with publication to follow quickly thereafter.  However, the Department's resources are currently focused on the Covid-19 crisis as a priority, and this has consequently had an impact upon other aspects of Departmental business.</p></reply>

Reflecting this commitment, the 2020 budget for disability services of &euro;2,054.5 million represents an increase of more than 7.2 % over the original 2019 provision</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan 2020 provides for general efficiencies to support new and existing service costs.  The HSE and all of the providers it funds are expected to continually review their cost structures to ensure the best use of resources and a focus on the use of these resources for client care to the greatest extent possible.  These efficiencies are to be achieved through the application of a 1% efficiency target to existing budgets across all service areas.  </p>  <p>  The very significant additional financial resources provided to disability services over the last year, together with the achievement of relatively modest efficiency savings, form part of the financing of the increased service levels set out in the National Service Plan 2020.  Against this background, the HSE is required to ensure that the efficiency targets are achieved in a manner that does not impact on the activity levels set out in the National Service Plan.  </p>  <p>  The unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 impact for health and social care services is recognised by my Department and the HSE.   As Minister for Health, I wish to commend health and social care providers in the disability sector for what has and continues to be a tremendous effort in supporting our most vulnerable members of society,   In relation to disability supports and services, I have been informed that the HSE has confirmed that the budget allocated to each provider funded under Section 38 and Section 39 of the Health Act 2004 by the relevant Community Health Care Organisation (CHO) will remain in place to year end.  This is subject to the provisions within the relevant service arrangement and ongoing cooperation regarding the utilisation and deployment of resources to meet priority need within each CHO.  </p></reply>

More recently the Department of Health asked the Health Research Board (HRB) to assess the existing evidence base to determine the impact on the systemic health of the population for those exposed to artificially fluoridated water. The HRB sought to answer this question using a systematic review process to analyse the evidence available in the peer reviewed literature. The review, published in 2015, found no definitive evidence that community water fluoridation is associated with negative health effects.</p>  <p>  A research project Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth (FACCT), conducted by UCC (2013 &ndash; 2017) and supported by the HSE, indicates that fluoridated communities continue to have lower levels of tooth decay than non-fluoridated communities. </p>  <p>  The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters. </p>  <p>  Many countries have water fluoridation schemes, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Australia and New Zealand. Water fluoridation is less common in Europe. However, fluoride is an essential part of oral health policy in all countries in Europe. In countries which do not fluoridate water this can mean fluoridation of salt or provision of community fluoridation through other means. </p>  <p>  European Council Directive 98/83 allows for a maximum permitted concentration of fluoride in drinking water up to 1.5mg/litre (or parts per million), almost twice the maximum level permitted in Ireland, which is set at between 0.6-0.8 parts per million. </p>  <p>  The Expert Body advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, is a safe and effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review. </p></reply>

The programme is aimed at maintaining the existing level of public bed provision and will also provide some additional capacity.</p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. The applicant can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home. The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.</p>  <p>  Based on the forecasted average net cost of a private bed under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, the full year cost for an extra 1,250 clients to be supported under the Scheme would be &euro;47.6m.

This represents the in-patient cost of a hospital bed including clinical staffing, theatres, laboratories, non-clinical staffing and cleaning, maintenance and other running costs. The cost includes critical care and ward beds but they are not separately identifiable. </p>  <p>  This represents the fully absorbed cost, (2019) which includes treatment and care costs (such as diagnostics and theatres) as well as the running costs such as heating, lighting and servicing equipment, but excludes capital and depreciation. In addition, this figure does not include other associated hospital costs such as day-case, outpatient and emergency department costs. </p>  <p>  In relation to capital expenditure, several factors determine the capital cost of a hospital bed. These include the nature of the bed (day case, in-patient/overnight, intensive/critical care, etc.), and the bed&rsquo;s location (within an existing hospital, within a new extension to an existing hospital or through the development of a new hospital). As such, there is no one capital cost for providing an additional hospital bed. </p>  <p>  A review of acute hospital beds currently in construction or recently completed determined an average capital cost per bed of &euro;375,000, including some enabling costs. ICU/HDU beds can cost up to &euro;1m per bed.</p>  <p>  However, these figures do not represent a universal capital cost for hospital beds.

This indicative estimate is  based on current fees payable by the HSE under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) and an estimated take-up rate based on previous research. </p>  <p>  Medical card holders aged over 16 years of age currently receive dental services under the DTSS.  The indicative cost for provision of  the new preventive oral healthcare packages for medical card holders aged over 16 years ranges from &euro;23-48 million. The preventive packages will be in addition to routine and complex care which will continue to be available under the DTSS. </p>  <p>  No separate analysis was carried out on the cost of providing dental care to 16- and 17-year olds.</p></reply>

The roles and powers of the Medical Council are laid out in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007. </p>  <p>  All doctors are required to possess a degree or diploma awarded from a Medical School or institution listed in the World Directory of Medical Schools (WDOMS).  Applicants from non-EU countries need to have their qualifications verified through the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) prior to applying to the Medical Council.  The Council can then confirm the relevant qualifications have been verified through the Electronic Portfolio of International Credentials (EPIC), available through the ECFMG website.  All non-EU applicants are required to provide documentary evidence of English language proficiency as part of their application and guidelines as to what can be accepted as evidence of communication skills are available on the Medical Council&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Doctors who graduate from Non-European Union/European Economic Area countries or Switzerland may be required to sit one of the Medical Council's examinations.  Doctors intending to pursue registration in the general or trainee specialist division may be required to sit the Pre-Registration Examination System (PRES).  The PRES examinations are primarily a test of knowledge and clinical skills in the main clinical disciplines of Obstetrics &amp;amp; Gynaecology, Paediatrics, Psychiatry, Surgery, and Medicine/General Practice. The PRES examinations are based on the Eight Domains of Good Professional Practice as devised by Medical Council.  All applicants for registration will be required to undergo a Level 1 assessment and verification of their documentation and alternative qualification, prior to eligibility for the PRES Level 3 being granted. PRES Level 3 is an assessment of a doctor's clinical skills.</p>  <p>   Applicants from EU/EEA countries are entitled to &ldquo;automatic recognition&rdquo; of their qualifications under the provisions of the EU Professional Qualifications Directive 2005/36/EC.  Prospective applicants are required to hold a qualification listed in Annex V 5.1.1. and/or Annex V 5.1.2, awarded by the relevant body.  All documents submitted need to be notarised/attested in the correct manner.  The Directive is designed to facilitate the freedom of movement of  professionals within the single market, and to remove barriers to allow this  movement to be as frictionless as possible.  As such, it does not provide for  the blanket language testing of every applicant, although recent updates allow  Member States a little more flexibility to ask for such evidence on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  The HSE independently requires a doctor to complete an assessment of their English language capabilities, as part of the employment engagement process.  The most recent circular from the HSE -  HR Circular 022/2018 attached - sets out the HSE position re English language requirements for NCHDs employed in the HSE.</p></reply>

The 3 medical conditions are</p>  <p>  -  spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis;</p>  <p>  -  intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy;</p>  <p>  -  severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy. </p>  <p>  To date three products have been added to Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019.  While the MCAP  is not currently operational, engagement is ongoing with the HSE in regard to progressing same. For more information relating to the Programme please visit the Department of Health's website. </p>  <p>  Pending full operation of the MCAP and for medical indications not included in the MCAP, doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licencing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients, should they wish to do so. Until these products are available in Ireland, it will be a matter for the prescriber and their patient to source the prescribed medical cannabis-based product. It is understood that patients who have been prescribed such products have sourced it from a Pharmacy in the Netherlands.  The authorities in the Netherlands do not permit the export to wholesalers or pharmacies of cannabis-based oil products but will permit the filling of individual prescriptions.</p></reply>

Enhanced supports for rural GP practices have been introduced, and have been increased under the 2019 Agreement between the Department of Health, the HSE, and the Irish Medical Organisation. </p>  <p>  Other measures include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday. </p>  <p>  In addition, the number of medical graduates undertaking GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 192 filled places in 2019. 217 training places are available for 2020 and the number of doctors applying to the training scheme commencing in 2020 is the highest on record at 461.  </p>  <p>  The Agreement reached in 2019 on GP contractual reforms and service developments will see an increase in expenditure on GP services of &euro;210 million annually by 2023, providing significant increases in capitation fees for participating GPs, and increases in supports for rural practices and practices in urban areas of deprivation.  </p>  <p>  Improved family friendly arrangements are another important feature of the revised contractual arrangements, with an increase in the locum rate for maternity and paternity cover, and an increase in the paternity leave allowance from 3 days to 2 weeks. This is in recognition of the need to ensure that general practice is compatible with doctors&rsquo; family commitments.  I am confident that these measures will help make general practice more sustainable and a more attractive career option for doctors.</p>  <p>  The HSE is committed to providing GP services within Co. Wexford. Rosslare and its environs is serviced by three GMS GPs. Currently there are no vacant GMS GP posts in Co. Wexford and no GP has reached the maximum panel size of patients permitted under the GMS Scheme. </p></reply>

It should only be used where it is likely to be beneficial as outlined in the HSE&rsquo;s guidance on PPE. This guidance is continuously monitored and may change as the coronavirus outbreak evolves. </p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has recommended that enhanced public health measures should be introduced to support the home support sector. These include measures to ensure PPE supply to home support providers and supporting access to the provision of training for staff in infection prevention and control. Homecare providers who have contracts with the HSE are able to apply for a supply and replenishment of PPE through their local Community Healthcare Organisation.</p>  <p>  Appropriate evidence-based guidance to support the work of health and social care providers on a range of issues, including infection prevention and control, has been developed by both the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and is updated regularly as appropriate and made available on their websites. The HPSC published updated guidance on the use of surgical face masks on 22   April and is now advising that surgical masks should be worn by healthcare workers, including home support workers.  Updated guidance for health and social care workers who visit homes was published on the HPSC website on 24 April.</p>  <p>  Homecare workers who are able to provide planned home care for people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 can play a critical role in helping to manage the COVID-19 emergency. Homecare workers undertaking this role will require some additional training to manage the associated risks. The most critical element of managing this risk is to review key skills (especially hand hygiene) but there will also be a requirement for appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>  <p>  The HPSC has advised home care providers that their healthcare workers should be told that if they are unwell and have symptoms of Covid-19 such as a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath, or if they are a contact of someone with Covid-19, they must call their manager before going to work. If a staff member develops symptoms while at work, they must report immediately to their line manager and not continue to see other clients.

These applications and any registration arising are free of charge to the applicant.</p>  <p>  This provision has removed the financial barrier which faced those nurses and midwives who wished to be restored to the register so that they could return to their profession and assist with addressing Covid-19. To date, the NMBI has restored 983 nurses and midwives to the register free of charge to the applicant. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the Act, section 108 registrations will cease to have effect after 31 July next.

Former civil and public servants who were in receipt of public service pensions were not affected by these reductions.  </p><p>In 2017 the Public Service Stability Agreement was introduced which set about unwinding the affects of FEMPI by restoring pay to civil and public servants through a series of salary increases. Because any individuals who were in receipt of pensions prior to the introduction of FEMPI were not affected by it, they do not stand to benefit from the restoration. </p><p>In addition to pay restoration, the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform (DPER) issued circulars 20/2017, 2/2018 and 19/2019 setting out the treatment of increases to certain public service pensions. Under the provisions of these circulars, a pension increase is applied only in circumstances where the current rate of pay for a serving employee exceeds the pay rate on which the retired staff member&rsquo;s pension is based. In practical terms, this meant that only a small number of pensioners were due an increase with effect from 1 September 2017 (the effective date of the first circular) as their pension was based on a higher rate of pay than the serving employee on that date. As each of the subsequent phases of pay restoration has come into effect, an increasing number of pensioners have become entitled to an increase and this has been applied where relevant. </p><p>The HSE has advised that it is working to ensure that all HSE pensioners who were due increases under the circulars had the correct increase applied at the correct phase of pay restoration. This represents a considerable undertaking as each individual pension must be considered on a case by case basis. </p><p>The HSE is satisfied that most people who were due an increase with effect from 1 September 2017 have received that increase and subsequent increases, and that any issue of non-application of an increase is in respect of retirees who were not due an increase on 1 September 2017 but who have become entitled as a result of one of the subsequent rounds of pay restoration. Any pension increases due will be paid to retired staff from the appropriate effective date. </p></reply>

The rights, welfare and best interests of children is fundamental to the legislation</p>  <p>  The recent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015 (as amended) on 4 May will, for the first time, provide a legal framework for registering the births of children who are born as a result of assisted human reproduction involving donated eggs or sperm or embryos. The legislation also requires donor details to be stored through the establishment of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register. This will enable children to access information on their donor should they so wish thus enabling them to exercise their rights to know their genetic identity. </p>  <p>  Commencement of Parts 2&amp;3 also entitles parents of children born in the State as a result of a donor assisted reproduction procedure performed before the 4th of May to apply to the courts for legal recognition of their parental status, subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  Following commencement, the legislation prohibits the use of non-anonymous gametes in most circumstances, embedding the rights of children to know their genetic heritage in future years.  </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the difficulties the global Covid pandemic has presented for donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  It has led to the closure of fertility clinics for several weeks and some individuals and couples have found themselves in a position where they can no longer use gametes they had previously purchased.  </p>  <p>  However, it is now over 5 years since the Children and Family Relationships Act was enacted and while I had intended to commence Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 last summer I allowed a longer lead time to for people to make arrangements to use gametes that have already been purchased, where appropriate, and to allow a sufficient pool of donors with the appropriate consent to be acquired  in advance of commencement of Parts 2&amp;3.</p>  <p>  Further delay to the commencement of Parts 2&amp;3 would have presented an unfair penalty to those parents who have already waited a substantial period of time to have their rights to parentage vindicated in law and most importantly for the State to vindicate the rights of donor conceived persons to information about their genetic identity.  </p></reply>

Two cannabis-based products have been deemed to have met the applicable criteria set out in the legislation and have been added to Schedule 1 of the legislation.</p><p>As these products will be subject to international export licensing requirements, which are outside the control of the Department of Health, they are not expected to be available in Ireland for a further period.</p><p>Once suitable medical cannabis products are made available by suppliers, the MCAP will make it possible for a medical consultant to prescribe a listed cannabis-based treatment for a patient under his or her care for the following medical conditions, where the patient has failed to respond to standard treatments:</p><p>-  spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis;</p><p>-  intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy;</p><p>-  severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy.</p><p>The Department of Health will make this information available on their website.</p><p>Pending full operation of the MCAP, doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licencing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients, should they wish to do so. In line with the Chief Medical Officer's advice, the granting of a licence for cannabis for medical purposes must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time. </p><p>Clinicians may submit an application on behalf of their patients to the HSE for reimbursement approval if the patient has a valid medical prescription for medical cannabis for one of the above medical conditions and have sourced a cannabis-based product which has been prescribed under a Ministerial license. </p><p>The HSE has advised that in the previous situations where it considered reimbursement support appropriate, the following steps were completed: </p><p>-  The patient&rsquo;s consultant is satisfied that all therapeutic options have been exhausted and is prepared to accept the responsibility for monitoring the patient&rsquo;s response to the cannabis product. </p><p>-  A prescriber applies to the Minister for a Ministerial license and this is granted. </p><p>-  The consultant completes an Individual Reimbursement Form, setting out the therapeutic benefit for the patient. It is important that this is completed in sufficient detail for therapeutic benefit to be demonstrated. </p><p>-  The Individual Reimbursement Form is considered by the Medicines Management Programme (MMP). </p><p>-  On review of the documentation, the MMP makes a recommendation for or against reimbursement support for the patient to the HSE, under the patient's eligibility, and informs the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) of that recommendation. </p><p>If approval is given, the PCRS, when authorised to proceed, will make the necessary arrangements to cover the costs involved for the patient. </p></reply>

The current Act provides for the establishment of the Dental Council, which is the regulatory body for the dental profession in Ireland, and which is charged with promoting high standards of professional education and professional conduct among dentists.  The Act also provides for the registration of dentists and dental specialists, education and training requirements, fitness to practise procedures, and the creation of auxiliary dental health professions.  </p>  <p>  The drafting of the Scheme of a new Dental Bill to modernise the Dentists Act has begun within my Department.  However priority has had to be given to the Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Bill, which is currently at Seanad Committee Stage.  This Bill provides for amendments to all five health professional regulatory Acts, including the Dentists Act, as a consequence of the transposition of the Modernised Professional Qualifications Directive, and to address a number of other issues.  </p>  <p>  While work on the Dental Bill is still at the early stages of preparation, considerable work has been undertaken in formulating the policy to underpin it.  It includes a provision that certain allied dental health professionals, including Clinical Dental Technicians and Dental Hygienists, will be permitted to work without being supervised by a dentist once they are working within their scope of practise.  </p>  <p>  The work on the modernisation of the Dentists Act in its entirety will progress once the Regulated Professions Bill has completed its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas, and has been enacted.</p></reply>

This disease has a broad impact on a person's functional abilities and usually results in movement, thinking (cognitive) and psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and signs in an individual with a parent with proven Huntington's Disease and is confirmed by confirmation of the presence of the Huntington's Disease gene. There is no cure. Management is multi-disciplinary and is based on treating symptoms with a view to improving quality of life.</p>  <p>  General medical services are provided by GPs. If the patients clinical condition warrants a referral to a Consultant then their GP will organise that for them. A patient's Local Health Office is the entry point to access wider community health and personal social services. In addition to GP services these also include public health nursing, community welfare, speech therapy, social work, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, psychiatric services and home help. The Department of Health also supports a non-condition specific approach to the delivery of health and personal social services to people with a disability. The overarching principle governing the planning and delivery of health services and supports for adults and children with disabilities, is that they should be integrated as much as possible with services and supports for the rest of the population. The Government&rsquo;s policy in this regard is set out in the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) which was published by the Department of Justice and Equality in July 2017.</p>  <p>  This question also concerns service matters and as such it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and made considerable improvements to access for patients waiting for high volume procedures and life limiting procedures including cataracts.</p><p>At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. Since then the numbers waiting have consistently improved and at the end of December 2019, they stood at 4,388. Of these, 396 patients are waiting over 9 months which represents a reduction of 91% when compared to July 2017, when the number waiting over 9 months stood at 4,371. A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. </p><p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to defer all non-urgent elective scheduled care activity, including outpatient clinics. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources are made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the World Health Organisation, and the National Action Plan published on 16 May.In addition all NTPF activity including validation was suspended in mid March. The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing provision of non-covid care including more routine care. It is envisaged that the private hospitals will play an important role in this regard.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the NTPF are currently working together to estimate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address any backlog or pent up demand. My Department continues to ensure that the resources available throughout our health system are best utilised at this unique and challenging time. </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy regarding eye procedure waiting lists, is contained in the following tables.</p><p>IPDC Ophthalmology Waiting List <table>    <tr>       <th>0-3 Mths</th>       <th>3-6 Mths</th>       <th>6-9 Mths</th>       <th>9-12 Mths</th>       <th>12-15 Mths</th>       <th>15-18 Mths</th>       <th>18-24 Mths</th>       <th>24-36 Mths</th>       <th>36-48 Mths</th>       <th>48+ Mths</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3648</td>       <td>3269</td>       <td>1174</td>       <td>697</td>       <td>404</td>       <td>275</td>       <td>234</td>       <td>110</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>9822</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Outpatient Ophthalmology Waiting List <table>    <tr>       <th>0-3Months</th>       <th>3-6Months</th>       <th>6-9Months</th>       <th>9-12Months</th>       <th>12-15Months</th>       <th>15-18Months</th>       <th>18-21Months</th>       <th>21-24Months</th>       <th>24-36Months</th>       <th>36-48Months</th>       <th>48+Months</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>7761</td>       <td>6380</td>       <td>4976</td>       <td>4259</td>       <td>3119</td>       <td>2492</td>       <td>2341</td>       <td>2029</td>       <td>5414</td>       <td>2175</td>       <td>455</td>       <td>41401</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

However, as this National Forum has not yet been established, no review has taken place and therefore, no options are available for consideration.</p>  <p>  In addition, section 11.1 of the review report outlined above, advises that the Final Report on the EU Project (SANCO/1/2009) states that before a recommendation for registration can be given, it has to be stated that registration without successful completion of HCA education and training is not possible.   </p>  <p>  Section 11.6 identifies that at present there are variable standards of training for HCAs, very little continuing and in-service education and training as well as a lack of governance and oversight for HCAs in the community.

Following extensive public consultation, and in partnership with CHO 8 and the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, a site was identified in the grounds of the Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore and initial drawings for the unit have been drafted.</p>  <p>  The Midlands is fortunate to have a well-developed palliative care service in the community and, whereas the ultimate aim is to care for people appropriately at home for as long as possible, the provision of specialist palliative care inpatient beds will facilitate hospital avoidance and support families in end of life care for their loved ones. It is envisaged that the new inpatient unit, when established, will act as the hub for specialist palliative care services in the Midlands and will be able to provide additional support for residential /community services, including the region&rsquo;s network of palliative care support beds.</p></reply>

Radiation oncology is available in five public hospitals: St. James's Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital Rathgar (which three together form the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network), Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Galway. Radiation oncology services for public patients are also provided in two private facilities in Waterford and Limerick. Meanwhile, patients from the North West can receive radiation oncology treatment at the North West Cancer Centre in Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Derry.</p>  <p>  The model of care for radiation oncology allows for the sufficient volume and concentration of activity and expertise to facilitate high quality radiation oncology treatments in line with best evidence and international best practice. Modern radiation oncology is increasingly complex. Delivery of such complex care requires several key components to ensure safe, high quality treatment. These include appropriate physical infrastructure and equipment, a highly trained multidisciplinary team including specialist doctors, nurses, radiation therapists, physicists and other health and social care professionals and a system of quality assurance that can ensure that radiation oncology services are safe, effective, equitable, efficient, timely and centred on the patients needs. </p>  <p>  A new facility in Cork University Hospital was opened recently, and construction will commence shortly on a new facility in University Hospital Galway. Future expansion of the facility in Beaumont is also envisaged. In line with the National Plan for Radiation Oncology, it is not proposed to establish a centre for radiation oncology in the Midlands.</p>  <p>  Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy (SACT/Chemotherapy) is delivered in 26 hospitals across the country, including in the Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore. In the context of Covid-19 some patients who would normally receive their treatment in Tullamore are now being treated in the Hermitage Medical Clinic, Dublin.</p></reply>

A comprehensive programme of investment in public nursing homes over the period 2016-2021 is well underway. The programme is aimed at maintaining the existing level of public bed provision and will also provide some additional capacity.</p><p>The National Development Plan provides capital funding over the next ten years for additional capacity requirements including 4,500 additional short-term and long-term beds across the public system in Community Nursing Units and other step-down facilities, as identified by the Health Service Capacity Review (2018). </p><p>Long-term residential care is often the most appropriate care option where an older person&rsquo;s needs are complex. However, the care model for the older population requires further progress towards supporting older people to remain living independently at home for longer. This is a key tenet of Sl&aacute;intecare and the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. In this regard the Department is advancing work in relation to improved community supports, particularly in the context of the development of a Statutory Home Support Scheme and the further exploration of measures such as those outlined in the policy framework <i>Housing Options for Our Ageing Population</i>jointly developed by the Departments of Health and Housing, Planning and Local Government. </p></reply>

In anticipation of the projected surge in Covid-19 cases and the expected impact on the health care system a major part of the Action Plan was to urgently ramp up capacity for acute hospital care facilities.  A critical element of the strategy was to put in place an arrangement with the private hospitals to use their facilities as part of the public system, to provide essential additional acute hospital services for the duration of the emergency. The terms of the arrangement reflected the expected Covid-19 pandemic at time of signing, and therefore is for a 3-month period, with an option for the HSE to extend it for a further month, and by mutual agreement thereafter. </p>  <p>  Under the agreement payment to the private hospitals will be on a cost only Open Book model whereby the hospitals will be reimbursed only for the operating costs properly incurred during the period. The costs that will be covered will be limited to normal costs of operating the hospital.  The final cost will be verified by independent firms of accountants appointed by the HSE and the private hospitals and there will be an arbitration mechanism in place in the event of any disagreement.  Under the Heads of terms private hospitals are funded to 80% of their estimated monthly costs in advance. The private hospitals combined submitted estimates for April which totalled &euro;115m, therefore &euro;90.2m in total was advanced to them for that month. A balancing payment will be made or funding clawed back depending on the outcome of the cost verification process. </p>  <p>  Since the purpose of the arrangement is to provide additional capacity to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for which there is no definitive time horizon it is not possible to indicate a precise cost estimate attaching to the arrangement. The cost only open book model is therefore the most effective way of ensuring the arrangement provided the additional capacity necessary and that it is value for money for the State.  </p></reply>

As such the arrangement is a temporary one.  The arrangement is for a 3-month period, with an option for the HSE to extend it for a further month.  Any extension of the arrangement beyond that would have to be agreed by the HSE and the private hospitals concerned. Any discussions regarding an extension would have to be considered in the context of the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic and the most effective use of resources in tackling it.  Therefore, while there is an option to extend the arrangement, it is not intended that it would be permanent.   </p></reply>

The Working Group&rsquo;s report was published in August 2019.</p><p>The role of the Working Group was to investigate, in detail, alternative approaches to dealing with the possession of drugs for personal use in Ireland. Research was conducted on behalf of the Working Group on alternative approaches taken in other jurisdictions, including Portugal and Colorado. Decriminalisation was also considered by this group, however it was concluded that decriminalising drug use would reduce our ability to help those who needed it. It could lead to de facto legalisation of drugs. To inform its deliberations, a public consultation was undertaken in 2018 which comprised of an online questionnaire, focus groups and an open policy debate. There were over 20,000 responses to the online questionnaire. This report also noted the growing dangers associated with cannabis use because of increased THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) levels, and stated the importance of all sectors working together to inform the public about the harms associated with cannabis use and all other illicit drugs. </p><p>The report of the Working Group can be found at:  </p><p>Following consideration of the report of the Working Group, the Minister for Health, the Minster for Justice and Equality and I announced the adoption of a health-led approach to the possession of drugs for personal use. There are two components to this new Health Diversion Approach whereby a person in possession of drugs, determined by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be for personal use, on the first occasion would be referred by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a mandatory basis to the Health Service Executive for a health screening and brief intervention. On the second occasion, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have discretion to issue an Adult Caution.</p><p>The Health Diversion Approach seeks to connect drug users with health services and to support them on their path to recovery. It will also give individuals the opportunity to avoid a criminal conviction. A small implementation, monitoring and evaluation group has been set up to progress the Health Diversion Approach.</p><p>I acknowledge the very real dangers we are facing as a society in terms of cannabis use. Cannabis use by adolescents, in particular, is worrying as it poses risks of dependence and developing psychotic illness. We cannot be complacent about the risk to health posed by cannabis use. While we pursue our important public health approach to drug use in Ireland, there are no plans to legalise cannabis or any other illicit drugs.</p></reply>

The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.  These changes are unavoidable and are largely beyond the control of my Department.  As you know, my Department is the forestry licence consent authority and, since 2017, all licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  </p><p>The situation with regard to felling licences has significantly improved since the start of 2020. Since January, 649 felling licences were issued up to 8th May.  These licences cover over 5,900 ha and a volume in excess of 1.6 million m<sup>3</sup>.  My Department continues to issue new felling licences at an average rate of approximately 100,000 m3 per week. </p><p>In terms of afforestation licences, from January 2018 to the end of December 2019, licences have been issued for 4,000 ha that are available to plant.  Again, since January 2020, 230 afforestation licences for 1,700 ha and 141 forest road licence for 50.7 km have issued.</p><p>I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and significant resources have been devoted to introducing a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements.  My Department is now meeting those needs as follows:</p><p>- New forestry inspectors and additional administrative staff have been assigned to licensing. More forestry inspectors will be recruited in 2020.</p><p>- Two new ecologists have joined the Department ecology team, with four more to be appointed shortly.</p><p>- We have engaged external ecological expertise to help with the backlog of files.  Four local ecologists have also been contract to provide extra support.  Further, an ecology contract with 5 new ecologists is due to be signed very soon.</p><p>- Additional administrative staff have been assigned to the Agriculture Appeals Office to assist with the increased workload of the Forestry Appeals Committee.</p><p>- Three planning officers have been contracted in to work with the Forestry Appeals Committee.</p><p>- A specialist mapping expert has been assigned to forestry issues.</p><p>In conclusion, let me assure you that our long-term commitment to forestry is unwavering and that every effort is being made to resolve current issues. I acknowledge that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.</p></reply>

This followed the successful conclusion of the remediation works contract. The Council has requested permission to operate the site as a public recreational amenity.  It is important to note that the main occupancy of the island is the headquarters for the Irish Naval Service and the Government has accordingly decided that ownership of the island will transfer to the Minister for Defence.  My Department, acquired ownership  of Haulbowline Island to enable remediation of the East Tip. My Department remains actively engaged with representatives of the Department of Defence and Cork County Council to put in place the appropriate mechanisms to transfer ownership of the island to the Department of Defence and to finalise a lease for the Council, to facilitate the operation of the recreational amenity.  </p>  <p>  The ultimate opening date of the facility will be a matter for Cork County Council in due course. </p></reply>

My Department and I are working to ensure that business and services to farmers can continue, keeping food and other processing facilities operational, ensuring that payments and commercial activities that are necessary to protect farm incomes can continue.</p><p>There are likely to be significant economic impacts for the agri-food sector, arising from reduced demand in key markets around the world.  The loss of high value food service customers is already of significant immediate concern.</p><p>I am pleased to say that, following engagement with my European colleagues, I secured the agreement of every single Member State to support a strong joint approach calling for a common European response to a pan European problem.  This joint approach calls for rapid deployment of support measures under the Common Market Organisation Regulation, including Private Storage Aid for dairy and other products, and exceptional aid for beef and sheep farmers.  It also focuses on flexibility for basic payments and rural development with earlier payment dates, higher rates of advance payment and flexibilities in relation to on-the-spot controls and administrative checks.</p><p>Following Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in leading an agreed EU-27 statement on the need for further supports, the Commission  has introduced Aids to Private Storage for Dairy (, , ), and .It is important that these and all available market supports are deployed. </p><p>I am also working with my colleagues in Government to ensure that all businesses, including those in the agri-food sector, get access to suitable supports, and the measures in place are being kept under review. </p><p>Working with my colleague Minister Humphreys, I have ensured that up to &euro;180 million in new lending capacity is available for the agri-food sector:  40% of the &euro;250 million COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme will be available for food businesses. Similarly, 40% of an additional &euro;200 million tranche of the Future Growth Loan Scheme will be ring fenced to provide long-term investment support for farmers, fishers and food businesses. </p><p>I continue to liaise with the banks on liquidity for the primary sector, and also want to highlight the availability of working capital assistance to farmers and fishers through Microfinance Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Loan. We will continue to keep the finance needs of the whole agri-food sector under review.</p><p>I have already provided an additional &euro;85m in supports for the beef sector in Budget 2020, on top of the &euro;20 million provided last year for the BEEP pilot.

It is a straightforward scheme, which can deliver a significant cash-flow injection, and I would encourage all suckler farmers to apply before the deadline of 15 May. </p><p>Conscious of the cash flow pressures on farms at present, I have brought forward &euro;26m in GLAS payments by a month, and these funds have been made already.  Balancing payments under the Organic Farming scheme have also been brought forward. I have also increased funding in my Department&rsquo;s Calf Welfare Investment Scheme from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;4 million, to assist farmers with extra calves. A range of practical flexibilities have been introduced in departmental schemes, including, for example, the extension of completion deadlines for TAMS by 3 months, and the submission for Nitrates records to the end of June. My Department has also worked to ensure that the supply chain continues to function. Critical state services in dairy and meat processing plants continue to function so that farmers have an outlet for their produce, a protocol has been developed for the continued operation of marts, albeit on a limited basis, and the critical certification and other services required to support exports of live animals and products continue to operate. </p><p>My Department and agencies will continue to monitor the impacts on the agri-food sector as the situation evolves, and to provide appropriate supports to the sector. Senior officials from my Department remain in constant contact with stakeholders right across the sector to share information on emerging issues and contingency planning, and we will continue to develop appropriate supports as the situation evolves. </p></reply>

Teagasc develops its programmes, services and activities in conjunction with its clients and partners overseen by an Authority that is representative of the main stakeholder groups in the agri food sector. It is a matter for Teagasc and its Board to prioritise activities in the delivery of these services and to allocate it resources in accordance with these priorities. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Teagasc that it does not have a role in the promotion of any particular commercial activity, including the export of live animals. Teagasc of course recognises the importance of live exports to the livelihoods of farmers and supports farmers in ensuring that this outlet continues to be a sustainable channel for calves. Teagasc&rsquo;s emphasis therefore is on ensuring that animals are produced that are of the highest possible beef quality and that all welfare standards are upheld to the greatest possible extent.</p>  <p>  Teagasc is also a member of the &lsquo;Calf Stakeholder Forum&rsquo; recently set up by my Department. Teagasc plays two important support roles with regard to the sustainability of the export of live calves: </p>  <p>  1. Calf management, health and breeding: Teagasc research and advisory activity emphasises the importance of colostrum feeding, calf housing and the prevention and treatment of disease. Teagasc along with ICBF have developed the Dairy Beef Index to ensure that the dairy herd produces high quality beef cattle, while at the same time minimizing any adverse consequences for calving difficulty or the gestation length of the dairy cow. In conjunction with Animal Health Ireland, Teagasc is also developing a control programme for IBR which will be critical in sustaining live exports.  </p>  <p>  2. Calf welfare: Teagasc&rsquo;s research and advisory services also have a critical role in promoting the highest possible calf welfare standards across the entire supply chain i.e. on dairy farms, in livestock marts, during transport and in lairage. It should be noted that research work carried out at Teagasc Grange on the welfare implications  of the transport of live animals to the continent has been instrumental in the maintenance of live exports from Ireland.  </p></reply>

This Regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all Member States. There is limited national discretion available to Member States in relation to a number of the Regulations articles. </p><p>In 2004, European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, and which met the specified criteria for exemption from veterinary prescription. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006/130/EC at the time and anthelmintics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.</p><p>There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019/6. However, since that time our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of anthelmintics has changed.  For example, anthelmintic resistance has been widely reported in parasites of livestock species in Ireland and globally, resistance is developing year-on-year and is now a significant animal health issue. </p><p>In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019/6. A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website <i>www.hpra.ie</i>.</p><p>The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019/6.  It also states that a consequence of this determination is that any such products that are supplied without veterinary prescription will need to be upregulated to supply under veterinary prescription.  Ireland and all other Member States must now comply with this regulation from January 2022.</p><p>In accordance with existing national legislation, antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products for use in food-producing species that are supplied under prescription may be dispensed by veterinary practitioners, pharmacists and licensed merchants.

My Department and I are working to ensure that business and services to farmers can continue, keeping food and other processing facilities operational, ensuring that payments and commercial activities that are necessary to protect farm incomes can continue.</p><p>There are likely to be significant economic impacts for the agrifood sector, arising from reduced demand in key markets around the world.  The loss of high value food service customers is already of significant immediate concern.</p><p>The response to the economic impacts on the sector should include a strong, shared EU response, using the instruments available in the Common Agricultural Policy. I have already highlighted to Commissioner Wojciechowski the serious consequences for farmers and the food industry and the need to ensure that the full range of market supports available under the Common Market Organisation Regulation are made available. These supports include Aids to Private Storage and Exceptional Aid measures, flexibilities when it comes to on-farm inspections and early payment of the Basic Payment Scheme. </p><p>Following Ireland&rsquo;s efforts in leading an agreed EU-27 statement on the need for further supports, the Commission have introduced Aids to Private Storage for Dairy (, , ), and .Applications for aid may be submitted as of 7 May 2020.</p><p>The provision in the regulation with regard to beef is for the entry into storage of separated hindquarters from S, E, U, R or O grade bovines over 8 months. Storage is for a fixed period of 90, 120 or 150 days.  Product currently in storage is not eligible. There is no storage limit, but there is a minimum volume of 15 tonnes/Contract.  The aid will be provided at a fixed rate of &euro;1,008 (90 days), &euro;1,033 (120 days) or &euro;1,058 (150 days). There is no closing date set in the regulation.</p><p>Private Storage Aid (PSA) is a risk management tool / safety net available to EU producers of certain agricultural products under the CMO regulation (1308/2013). The aim is to facilitate producers to store the product for a stipulated temporary storage period. It is not possible to project the effect of Private Storage Aid on farm gate prices. In the first instance, it is for industry to decide if they wish to place product into storage, then the schemes operates on a first-come first-served basis across the EU, there is no specific Member State allocation with the exception of cheese, and also a number of factors will determine farm gate price. </p><p>The fact that the entire hindquarter (bone-in or deboned) has to be put into storage, rather than individual steak cuts, limits its practical benefit for the Irish beef industry. Nonetheless, it is an important market support tool to have available.</p><p>I am also working with my colleagues in Government to ensure that all businesses, including those in the agrifood sector, get access to suitable supports, and the measures in place are being kept under review. </p><p>Working with my colleague Minister Humphreys, I have ensured that 40% of the &euro;250 million COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme will be available for food businesses. Similarly, 40% of an additional &euro;200 million tranche of the Future Growth Loan Scheme will be ring fenced to provide long-term investment support for primary producers and food businesses. I continue to liaise with the banks on liquidity for the primary sector, and also want to highlight the availability of working capital assistance to farmers and fishers through Microfinance Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Loan. We will continue to keep the finance needs of the whole agrifood sector under review.</p><p>I have already provided an additional &euro;20m in supports for the beef sector in Budget 2020, on top of the &euro;20 million provided last year for the BEEP pilot. This year&rsquo;s scheme &ndash; the Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme (Sucklers), will deliver a maximum payment of &euro;90 per suckler cow for the first 10 cows, and &euro;80/head thereafter. This is a significant increase in the payment available compared to the BEEP Pilot in 2019. This extra funding is available to suckler farmers right now. It is a straightforward scheme, which can deliver a significant cash-flow injection, and I would urge you to encourage suckler farmers to apply before the deadline of  Friday 15 May. </p><p>Conscious of the cash flow pressures on farms at present, I have brought forward &euro;26m in GLAS payments by a month, and these funds were paid recently.  Balancing payments to participants in the Organic Farming Scheme have also been brought forward. I have also increased funding in my Department&rsquo;s Calf Welfare Investment Scheme from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;4 million, to assist farmers with extra calves. A range of practical flexibilities have been introduced in departmental schemes, including, for example, the extension of completion deadlines for TAMS by 3 months, and the submission for Nitrates records to the end of June. My Department has also worked to ensure that the supply chain continues to function. Critical state services in dairy and meat processing plants continue to function so that farmers have an outlet for their produce, a protocol has been developed for the continued operation of marts, albeit on a limited basis, and the critical certification and other services required to support exports of live animals and products continue to operate. </p><p>My Department and agencies will continue to monitor the impacts on the agrifood sector as the situation evolves, and to provide appropriate supports to the sector. Senior officials from my Department remain in constant contact with stakeholders right across the sector to share information on emerging issues and contingency planning, and we will continue to develop appropriate supports as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

The Act was passed, after a lengthy and constructive debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas and came into operation on 6 March 2014.</p>  <p>  Offences under the Act may be prosecuted in the District Court by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, local authorities and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Matters tried on indictment are the remit of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the normal manner.  Accordingly, the statistics set down below relate to cases prosecuted at the suit of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  Prosecutions under the Act have been pursued following investigations by authorised officers of the Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and authorised officers of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  These officers investigate matters relating to animal cruelty and neglect and, where the evidence supports such action, a file prepared and the matter pursued through the Courts.</p>  <p>  Since the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 came into operation in March 2014, over 100 cases have been prosecuted through the Courts.  Fines in excess of &euro;60,000 have been imposed.  Seven persons have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment; these sentences were suspended in four cases.  The Probation Act was applied in eight instances.</p>  <p>  Sixteen persons have been disqualified from keeping animals under section 58 of the Act.</p>  <p>  A number of cases remain before the Courts and further files have been sent to the Chief State Solicitor with a view to be instituting proceedings; other files are currently being examined in my Department with a view to pursuing a prosecution if the evidence so warrant.</p>  <p>  In summary, the current modern legislative framework provided by the Act is considered fit for purpose. Similarly, enforcement of the existing legislation has been working satisfactorily, and is kept under review with a view to ongoing improvements as needed.  </p></reply>

The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980&rsquo;s.  A number of investigative and preparatory works and initiatives have been undertaken over the last few years in respect of a potential dredging project in Howth FHC. </p>  <p>  A final site investigation report was received in October 2016 and has been assessed by my Department's Engineers. This report included vital information on the nature and amount of the material to be dredged. The Department also appointed Consulting Engineers in 2016 to advise on a number of possible developments in Howth, including a dredging project. A final report was issued from the Consulting Engineers in late October 2017 which confirmed that, while the concentrations of contaminants in the sediment to be dredged are such that it is classified as &ldquo;non-hazardous&rdquo;, this classification means that dumping at sea will not be permitted, which in turn has a significant effect on the project cost.  </p>  <p>   Department Engineers subsequently met with Fingal County Council, to review possible operational and permitting requirements. Engagement with the Council is ongoing in regard to exploring disposal options for the dredged material. It is my Department&rsquo;s view that an option to re-use the dredged material to the west of the West Pier as part of the methodology for the project is the most effective and efficient option. </p>  <p>  It is estimated that circa 225,000 cubic metres of silt will need to be removed from the harbour in the event that a full harbour dredge is undertaken and, for illustration purposes, this was equated to an estimated 20,000-30,000 possible truck movements. It is also the position that if the option to re-use the material is not possible, the potential costs of the project increase significantly and the overall scope of the project would have to be re-examined.</p>  <p>  The project itself will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Statement and a Waste License which are being progressed. The permitting process is likely to take up to 24 months. A variety of factors will impact on the cost of a potential dredging project, including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors. </p>  <p>The Department went to tender on the 3rd of October 2018 for a Consulting Engineering practice to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase, and should a decision be made to progress the project, this consultant will also be responsible for the supervision of onsite works. The successful tender was commissioned for these works on the 19th of December 2018.  </p>  <p>  Site investigation works are being undertaken, as are technical and environmental impact assessments; however the COVID19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the ability to complete the research and investigation works. These works are required as part of an overall planning application submission and it remains my Department&rsquo;s intention to lodge a planning application for the Howth Dredging project in 2020.</p>  <p>  As is the case with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, any future decision with regard to initiating a full dredging project in Howth FHC will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.</p></reply>

This Regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all Member States. There is limited national discretion available to Member States in relation to a number of the Regulations articles. </p><p>In 2004, European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, and which met the specified criteria for exemption from veterinary prescription. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006/130/EC at the time and anthelmintics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.</p><p>There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019/6. However, since that time our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of anthelmintics has changed.  For example, anthelmintic resistance has been widely reported in parasites of livestock species in Ireland and globally, resistance is developing year-on-year and is now a significant animal health issue. </p><p>In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019/6. A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website <i>www.hpra.ie</i>.</p><p>The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019/6.  It also states that a consequence of this determination is that any such products that are supplied without veterinary prescription will need to be upregulated to supply under veterinary prescription.  Ireland and all other Member States must now comply with this regulation from January 2022.</p><p>In accordance with existing national legislation, antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products for use in food-producing species that are supplied under prescription may be dispensed by veterinary practitioners, pharmacists and licensed merchants. This means that all current stakeholders that are already permitted to supply such products will be entitled to continue to stock them in the future (but from January 2022 onwards a veterinary prescription will be needed to dispense them).</p><p>My Department is committed to working with all stakeholders in considering how best to implement the new EUI Regulations on veterinary medicinal products and plan to have a public consultation in Q2 2020.  A dedicated email address has been set up for this purpose and I would encourage all interested parties to send their observations to vetmedregs@agriculture.gov.ie.  </p><p>These changes which will take place will do so from January 2022 and, as such, are not related to or impacted by the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

This aid was granted to provide temporary market adjustment support in response to a specific market disturbance as outlined in Ireland's notification to the EU Commission and the 5% reduction was part of the conditionality sought by the EU.   </p>  <p>  Approved BEAM participants have given a commitment to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on the holding by 5% for the period 01 July 2020 to 30 June 2021 as compared with the period 01 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 as recorded on Department systems.</p>  <p>  With regard to the use of funds from the BEAM Scheme in 2019, I have already provided &euro;85m in supports for the beef sector in Budget 2020, on top of the &euro;20 million provided last year for the BEEP pilot. This includes a &euro;45 million provision for an extension to the BDGP (Beef Data and Genomics Programme) </p>  <p>  This year&rsquo;s scheme &ndash; the Beef Environmental Efficiency Programme (Sucklers), will deliver a maximum payment of &euro;90 per suckler cow for the first 10 cows, and &euro;80/head thereafter up to a maximum of 100 head/herd.  This is a significant increase in the payment available compared to the BEEP Pilot in 2019. This extra funding is available to suckler farmers right now. It is a straightforward scheme, which can deliver a significant cash-flow injection, and I would urge you to encourage suckler farmers to apply before the deadline of 15 May.</p></reply>

The purpose of my engagement with him has been to highlight the economic impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on our agrifood sector, as well as the need to have a strong European response to deal with the crisis.</p>  <p>  At this extremely difficult time, the protection of human life and health is vital, and is a shared priority amongst my European colleagues. However, it is also clear that the crisis is likely to impose significant economic impacts, including for the agriculture sector. In this regard, I welcome the measures introduced by the Commission to date to support the sector, including the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative, the temporary State Aid framework and the payment flexibilities provided for under the current CAP regulations.  However, I believe a more extensive, specific response targeted at the agriculture sector is required.  </p>  <p>  I wrote to Commissioner Wojciechowski in early March, and again in early April, urging him to consider the implementation of support measures under the Common Organisation of the Market (CMO) Regulation.  In between, on 25 March, I took part in a video-conference meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers with the Commissioner and took the opportunity to highlight the potential economic impact the COVID-19 crisis will have on Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood sector.  I again urged the Commissioner to consider the deployment of market support measures, and called for further flexibilities to be shown in relation to CAP Pillar I and Pillar II payments.  I subsequently reinforced these messages in a one-to-one video conference call with the Commissioner on Wednesday 15 April.   </p>  <p>  Throughout this time, I also engaged with my European colleagues to seek a strong, shared EU response, following which I secured the participation of every single Member State in a strong Joint Statement calling for a common European response to a pan-European problem, which my officials submitted to the Commissioner's office on Thursday 16 April.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that after this strong show of European solidarity the Commission swiftly announced a programme of support for the sector including Aids for Private Storage for the meat and dairy sector, and flexibilities with regard to control measures and scheme implementation.  </p>  <p>  I intend to continue a sustained engagement at the highest level with the European Commission on this matter. In that regard, I have again spoken personally to Commissioner Wojciechowski on 7 May to highlight the need for an ongoing focus on the challenges to the sector at this time, and the continued requirement for a strong, common approach at European level. I will stress this point further at the video conference of European Agriculture Ministers with the Commissioner on 13 May.</p></reply>

The conditions governing market access are set out in veterinary health certificates negotiated with importing countries. Once a veterinary health certificate has been agreed bilaterally, it is matter for industry, with the support of my Department and Bord Bia, to avail of the resulting market opportunities. However, the actual level of exports to a particular destination in any given period will depend on a range of factors, including global supply and demand dynamics, currency fluctuations and individual customer requirements.  </p>  <p>  There have been no new developments regarding the export of Irish beef to the Islamic Republic of Iran. A veterinary health certificate for beef exports to Iran which was agreed in March 2013 remains valid. The certificate specifies that the beef must be boneless and is restricted to animals aged under 30 months. </p>  <p>  Trade with Iran, including Irish beef exports, is hindered by a combination of unfavourable trading conditions, competition from lower-cost producers, fluctuations in domestic meat prices, and non-regulatory or financial barriers. In relation to the non-regulatory barriers, work is ongoing at EU level to facilitate efficient commercial transactions between businesses in member states and Iran.</p></reply>

There is a minimum loan amount of &euro;100,000 for SMEs with a specially negotiated minimum of &euro;50,000 for primary agriculture.

It should be noted also that farmers are also eligible to apply to Microfinance Ireland for smaller loan amounts.</p></reply>

The closure of many markets and disruption of established distribution channels, particularly to restaurants and the food service industry domestically and internationally, has seen market demand and sale prices drop very substantially in many of our key markets. However, there are still markets open both domestically and internationally and it is important that we continue to supply these markets to maintain food supply, service our established customers and be in a position to take advantage of increased demand as markets open up.  That reopening of markets may commence now that some countries are commencing a phased re-opening from lockdowns, but may take some months to return to a level of normality.  </p><p>I have met with representatives of our fisheries sector on a number of occasions, most recently on 29 April, to hear their views on the impacts of the Pandemic and how the EMFF Programme may support them during this difficult period.  Representation included the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, the four fisheries producer organisations, the fisheries cooperatives and the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association.  There was a positive and constructive engagement, with a broad consensus from industry representatives, including inshore fisheries representatives, that aid for temporary tie-up of fishing vessels should be the priority, enabling some vessels to tie-up, while others fished to meet market demands.  </p><p>Following my engagement with representatives of fishermen, I announced on 8 May a Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme for fishing vessels in the Polyvalent, Beam Trawl and Specific segments of the fleet,<i></i>to be<i></i>implemented under Ireland&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme 2014-20, co-funded by the Government of Ireland and the European Union.</p><p>The Covid-19 Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme will be operational from 1 June and will be available to the inshore fleet and to larger vessels.  It will allow vessel owners to voluntarily opt to tie up for a maximum of two months over the period June to August.  The Scheme will support the fixed costs incurred by the vessel owners and is designed to complement the Covid-19 wage supports and loan arrangements already being provided by Government to the fishing sector and indeed other sectors of our economy.  The supports to fixed costs available under the Scheme are outlined in the table below and range from &euro;6,000 per month for a maximum of two months for the very largest vessels over 24 metres, to &euro;500 per month for a maximum of two months for the very smallest vessels under 6 metres in length.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Size of vessel</th>       <th>Payment over 1-month tie-up period</th>       <th>Payment over 2-month tie-up period</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Size of vessel</td>       <td>Payment over 1-month tie-up period</td>       <td>Payment over 2-month tie-up period</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;gt; 24m</td>       <td>&euro;6,000</td>       <td>&euro;12,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>18 &amp;lt; 24m</td>       <td>&euro;4,600</td>       <td>&euro;9,200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>15 &amp;lt; 18m</td>       <td>&euro;2,000</td>       <td>&euro;4,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12 &amp;lt; 15m</td>       <td>&euro;1,900</td>       <td>&euro;3,800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10 &amp;lt; 12m</td>       <td>&euro;800</td>       <td>&euro;1,600</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8 &amp;lt; 10m</td>       <td>&euro;750</td>       <td>&euro;1,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 &amp;lt; 8m</td>       <td>&euro;500</td>       <td>&euro;1,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&amp;lt;6m</td>       <td>&euro;500</td>       <td>&euro;1,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In order to underpin the Government&rsquo;s policy of ensuring that the food chain is maintained and to maintain an essential presence in our markets, the Scheme will be available to a maximum of 66% of the fishing fleet, in the different size categories, in any one month. Any vessel not receiving support to tie-up in any particular month may continue to fish. </p><p>In order to limit the benefits of the Scheme to active vessels, an applicant vessel must have carried out fishing activities at sea for at least 120 days over the 2-year period 2018/19 and have made a first sale of fish to a minimum value of &euro;5,000 in the calendar year 2019, by reference to the Irish Sales Note System administered by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.</p></reply>

There is one cypermethrin-based product authorised for use in forestry plantations.  This authorisation is for the control of Pine weevil (Hylobius abietis) in replanted forest sites, where the control of this pest is necessary to keep young tree saplings alive and to keep the forest stand viable.  This application is done by handheld or knapsack sprayers, where a small quantity of product is applied directly onto each sapling.  </p>  <p>   There is no legal requirement for forest owners to inform adjacent land owners of their intention to spray, although many do nor is there a need for animals in adjacent properties to be moved as the application of this PPP is by hand in a very targeted manner that minimises exposure of the environment.   Regulations require users of this PPP to be professionally trained and they are required to refrain from application within 20m of watercourses.  There is very little cypermethrin used in recent years and the sector has generally moved to use alternative PPPs.  My Department is currently funding projects investigating alternative ways of controlling this very damaging pest.</p></reply>

This puts us on a trajectory which would be consistent with net zero carbon emissions by 2050. A key part of the Plan is a move to 70% renewable electricity by 2030.The Climate Action Plan commits to actions to ensure that renewable self-consumers can sell excess electricity they produce back to the grid. Action 30 of the Climate Action Plan commits to the delivery of a framework for micro-generation from renewable technologies including solar photovoltaic (PV), micro-wind, micro-hydro and micro combined heat and power (CHP), whilst ensuring principles of equity, self-consumption and energy efficiency first are incorporated.</p><p>A Micro-Generation working group, chaired by my Department, is examining an enabling framework for micro- generation which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments. The proposed support mechanism will be outlined in a public consultation in 2020 and a suitable support payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all micro-generators by 2021. </p><p>Under the EU Clean Energy package (CEP), Ireland will transpose the Internal Energy Markets Directive governing electricity market rules, which will allow for sharing of renewable energy in communities. In this regard the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a Roadmap for the Clean Energy Package&rsquo;s Electricity and Renewables Directives in March  this year which provides for a public consultation on the regulatory framework for prosumer development later this year.

Although users of the 112 SMS service are encouraged to pre-register with 112.ie, I understand that the technical issues arising with the website did not adversely affect the functionality of the 112 SMS messaging service and that any person with an Irish-registered phone who wished to use SMS to contact the ECAS could do so.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-05-13a.2739.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051300129#WRXX00400"><p>The potential sources of indoor air pollution are wide ranging and diverse and addressing these fall across a number of Department&rsquo;s and Agency&rsquo;s functional areas. These sources include:</p><p>Local ambient air quality</p><p>Building technology (heating systems, ventilation systems, etc.)</p><p>Building fabric (construction materials, insulation materials, etc.)</p><p>Occupant activity (cooking, smoking, solid fuel usage, chemicals, etc)</p><p>Tobacco smoking</p><p>My Department has responsibility for national policy relating to outdoor air quality and certain emissions, and has been taking a number of actions to improve this, some of which will also impact positively on indoor air quality. For example, the Climate Action Plan includes actions such as upgrading a third of all homes to at least a B2 energy standard and installing approximately 600,000 heat pumps by 2030 (400,000 of these into existing homes and 200,000 into new homes to be built).</p><p>Ireland also faces challenges in relation to concentrations of particulate matter (PM) in smaller towns, which is predominately related to domestic solid fuel burning. The extension of the current smoky coal ban to 13 new towns from September of this year will contribute to addressing concentrations of PM and related air quality concerns  for residents in the towns concerned. </p><p>Legislation is also in place which limits the emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds from paints and varnishes in order to reduce the levels indoor air pollution within buildings. Further information is available from the EPA at the following link:</p><p>Another of my Department&rsquo;s overarching  areas of responsibility as regards indoor air quality relates to environmental radiation. </p><p>Radon is a naturally occurring, colourless, odourless and tasteless radioactive gas formed in the ground by the radioactive decay of uranium which is present in all rocks and soils, and the gas can accumulate in homes and workplaces. It is the greatest source of exposure to ionising radiation for the general public in Ireland and the leading cause of lung cancer after smoking. It is estimated that exposure to radon accounts for approximately 300 lung cancer cases each year. </p><p>Certain areas of the country are more likely to have a high number of homes with excessive levels of radon and these areas are known as High Radon Areas.  Comprehensive information on radon, including a radon map of Ireland  and remediation options, is available on the EPA&rsquo;s website </p><p>Recognising the scale of the radon problem in Ireland, the Government tasked an inter-agency group to develop a National Radon Control Strategy (NRCS), which would comprehensively address the radon problem in Ireland. </p><p>Progress under the Strategy to date includes:</p><p>The establishment and launch of a dedicated website which provides customised information for different groups (such as homeowners, medical professionals and local authorities); </p><p>The development and rollout of a short targeted course for construction site staff on radon prevention. This course is now run by the Construction Industry Federation;</p><p>The development and rollout of a targeted training course for local authorities, public bodies and radon contractors on radon remediation; and,</p><p>The development of a registration scheme for radon measurement services in 2017. The resulting list of registered services is available to the public on . </p><p>Phase 2 of the NRCS includes further measures to raise awareness of the dangers of radon and encourage testing and remediation measures. These measures will complement the ongoing work of my Department in developing a National Clean Air Strategy, which will set out and give effect to clean air policies in order to meet national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities.</p><p>As stated above, other key control measures to reduce indoor air pollution fall outside my own remit. For example, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is responsible for policy and legislation in relation to building standards and ventilation for both residential and commercial dwellings,  and sets appropriate standards regarding ventilation, heating appliances and materials used. </p><p>Another factor that influences indoor air quality, particularly in homes, is of course, smoking. The responsibility for the development of policies to tackle this important public health issue falls within the remit of the Department of Health</p></reply>

LULUCF includes activities associated with forestry, croplands, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other lands. Hedgerows, as landscape features within the cropland and grassland categories, can form part of the emission and removal estimates for these land use categories. Emissions and removals of greenhouse gases associated with land-based activities are reported in a different category to those associated with agricultural activity, in line with international reporting guidelines.</p>  <p>  While such emissions are not currently accounted for in relation to the calculation of compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s emissions targets in the period to 2020, from 2021 onwards these emissions will be integrated into the EU framework for compliance with national emissions targets. It is, therefore, essential that Ireland has robust policies in place to manage emissions and enhance removals from LULUCF. </p>  <p>  The EPA has funded and continues to fund research projects related to the sequestration potential of lands, including specifically into hedgerows. As with any LULUCF category, the methodology must capture the emissions or removals associated with human activity compared with a reference or base year. The EPA is also currently developing a national land-use map for reporting on land based activities under the LULUCF Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2018/841) and, as part of this, is examining mechanisms to assist in the development of estimates of the carbon stock associated with hedgerows.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

In that regard the issue of compensation does not arise. </p>  <p>  In order to comply with the EU Habitats Directive and the principles of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO), the Government decided in 2006 to cease all indiscriminate commercial fishing in the sea and to manage salmon fisheries strictly in line with scientific advice.  On foot of that decision, in 2007, the Government introduced a hardship scheme open to all holders of a commercial salmon licence.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;25m was made available for direct payments to former fishermen, based on their track record in the fishery, with a further &euro;5m available for projects in affected communities.  The average payment to individual fishermen was approximately &euro;23,000 and the highest individual payment was over &euro;180,000.</p>  <p>  The scheme closed in 2008 with all funds expended and there are currently no plans to introduce a similar scheme.  </p></reply>

As a first step, the purchase of certain single use plastics has been banned throughout the public service. We are committed to increase recycling rates of plastics from 34% now to 50% by 2025 and 55% by 2030, along with other EU member states, and to phase out non-recyclable plastics entirely. A Deposit and Return Scheme is one option proposed for EU member states to consider as a means of increasing the collection of plastic beverage containers and achieve the new 90% target for this waste stream identified in the Single Use Plastic Directive.     </p>  <p>  In 2019 I commissioned a study to examine how Ireland can deliver a 90% collection target for single use beverage containers, including plastic bottles, as required under the Single Use Plastics Directive. This study examines the possibility of introducing a Deposit and Return Scheme and how this might operate in an Irish context. The introduction of an initiative such as a Deposit and Return Scheme needs to be carefully considered in the context of potential benefits, expected costs and impacts identified to enable evidence-based decision making in this matter and having regard to other potential measures that would facilitate the 90% collection rate. The study into how Ireland can achieve the 90% collection target has been received and is currently being reviewed in the context of developing a new Waste Action Plan.    </p>  <p>  The introduction of a Deposit and Return Scheme was also considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in 2018. The estimated set up and running costs were identified as between &euro;76m to &euro;116m net cost, without consideration of the impacts on the existing kerbside collection and existing household subsidy.</p></reply>

The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of EVs, who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles on public streets, to charge their EVs near their homes.  </p><p>Home charging is the most cost-effective method of charging, followed by on-street public charging and then destination charging. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. Combined with a public charging network, Ireland&rsquo;s home charging network will help sustain and service the growth in electric vehicle numbers.</p></reply>

Since the Commissioner's appointment, my Department and I have had a number of interactions with the Commissioner. I most recently met the Commissioner, via teleconference, on 19 March.</p><p>Under his Terms of Reference, I asked the Commissioner to engage with all relevant stakeholders, including local community organisations, Bord na M&oacute;na, ESB, the Midlands Transition Team, Local Authorities, public representatives and relevant trade unions and workers' representatives. Detailed stakeholder engagement with Bord na M&oacute;na included site visits by the Commissioner to the Bord na M&oacute;na plants/bogs in Lough Boora, Blackwater and Mount Dillon, and engagement with employees and management on these sites.</p><p>I have recently received the Commissioner's first progress report and I intend to bring this report to Government and to publish it shortly.</p><p>The Commissioner is undertaking his work on a part-time basis, with administrative support provided by my Department. The Commissioner is also being supported in his engagements with stakeholders in the Midlands, as required, by the secretariat to the Midlands Regional Transition Team. I am now considering these arrangements following receipt of the Commissioner's first report, and in the context of the envisaged ongoing role for the Commissioner in relation to just transition in the Midlands.</p><p>The Government has committed significant resources in 2020, through allocating a portion of the additional carbon tax revenue to be raised on foot of Budget 2020, to measures to support the delivery of an effective just transition for the Midlands. This includes &euro;20 million for a new energy efficiency retrofitting scheme to be focused on the Midlands, &euro;5 million for peatland rehabilitation outside of the Bord na M&oacute;na estate and &euro;6 million for a dedicated new just transition fund with ESB agreeing to contribute an additional &euro;5 million to this fund. The Government is also examining measures to support a much higher level of bog restoration on Bord na M&oacute;na bogs and to provide for a continued role for existing Bord na M&oacute;na workers on these bogs.</p><p>I held a series of meetings in the Midlands on 11 November last with a number of my Cabinet colleagues (Minister Madigan, Minister Donohoe and Minister of State Moran), during which we had discussions with a number of local stakeholders on the issues to be addressed under a Just Transition plan for the Midlands. I have also visited the Midlands on a number of other occasions since the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision last summer, including 31 July when I met with the worker directors of Bord na M&oacute;na, the Midlands Regional Transition Team, the Midlands Enterprise Strategy Chair, the Regional Skills Forum and local Oireachtas members. These engagements have also informed my subsequent appointment of Mr Mulvey as Just Transition Commissioner.</p><p>My Department is in ongoing contact with Bord na M&oacute;na on a range of issues and I receive regular detailed briefings from officials as required.</p></reply>

The Platform works as an open forum, gathering relevant local, regional and national governments, businesses and trade unions, NGOs and academia to promote knowledge sharing and exchanges of experiences between EU coal and carbon-intensive regions to enable regions to identify and respond to their unique contexts and opportunities.     </p>  <p>  Membership of the Platform enables regions to participate in multi-stakeholder dialogue on policy frameworks and financing for successful transformation of the included regions, to share best practice and to avail of support, in the form of technical assistance, for the development of strategies and projects for local regions, focusing in particular on the employment challenges faced by workers affected by decarbonisation. Though the Platform has not met recently, given the global health pandemic, the Platform is, and will be, an ongoing feature in supporting the Midlands region, and coal regions across Europe in their transition to a low-carbon economy.    </p>  <p>  The MRTT was established by Offaly County Council in July 2018 with the objectives of pursuing funding opportunities and actions to mitigate the impact of the Bord na M&oacute;na job losses on the individuals concerned, and on the local and regional economy; and positioning the region to develop alternative forms of employment, attract investment and maximize existing employment opportunities and resources. The MRTT comprises relevant regional and national authorities and stakeholders and my Department has also attended a number of its meetings. The secretariat to the MRTT has also been engaged in supporting the work of the Just Transition Commissioner, Mr Kieran Mulvey.    </p>  <p>  I am informed by the MRTT that in February 2020, a Service Level Agreement for Technical Assistance for Regions in Transition (START) was agreed between the Secretariat of the Coal Regions in Transition Platform, and Offaly County Council, on behalf of the MRTT. I am further informed that this programme of support will seek to undertake a series of preparatory actions and engagements with communities during the course of 2020, that, together with the work of the Just Transition Commissioner, will inform the development of a longer-term just transition plan for the region. I expect the START work will, in turn, assist in the further refinement of investment needs for the region, both public and community-led, that will also inform future Exchequer and EU funding decisions. My Department is in ongoing contact with the MRTT secretariat, as the START work programme progresses. </p></reply>

Of these, 840,000 will be passenger vehicles, The plan also sets out a range of actions to support this growth which includes introducing legislation to ban the sale of new fossil fuel cars from 2030.</p><p>There is a wide range of supports already available to support the uptake of electric vehicles including:</p><p>- a purchase grant of up to &euro;5,000 for new electric vehicles  </p><p>- Vehicle Registration Tax relief of up to &euro;5,000 for battery electric vehicles and up to &euro;2,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles</p><p>- grants of up to &euro;7,000 to support the purchase of electric vehicles in the taxi/hackney/limousine sector;</p><p>- Accelerated Capital Allowances for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure;</p><p>- a grant of up to &euro;600 to support the installation of a home charger for purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles;</p><p>- a Public Charge Point Scheme to provide funding to local authorities for the development of on-street public chargers</p><p>- Benefit-in-Kind relief for battery electric vehicles;</p><p>- low motor tax of &euro;120 for battery electric vehicles; and</p><p>- a discount on tolls of 50% for battery electric vehicles and 25% for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (up to a maximum amount of &euro;500 per year with greater reductions off-peak on the M50).</p><p>In addition, under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million to support the development of a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network.</p><p>There are now almost 19,000 electric vehicles under taxation in Ireland. This represents a quadrupling of the number of electric vehicles that were on Irish roads at the end of 2017. I fully expect the number of electric vehicles to continue to increase as more models become available and the supporting infrastructure continues to be put in place. Vehicle numbers will be boosted further towards the middle of this decade, when the total cost of ownership of electric vehicles will reach parity with their fossil fuel counterparts.</p></reply>

The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) have been conducting weekly surveys of local authorities to determine whether there is an overall increase in illegal waste activities to feed into the Local Authority Business Continuity Working Group, established on foot of the COVID-19 emergency. Information is also available through the OEE who monitor complaints made through the National Environmental Complaints Line and the "See it, Say it" app.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the Anti-Dumping Initiative in 2017, funding of &euro;6.3 million has been provided by my Department which has supported over 700 projects and removed 10,000 tonnes of illegally dumped waste across the country. In this, we have been supported by community and voluntary groups, who have acted as a bulwark against the spread of this behaviour. It is of critical importance that these efforts are safeguarded and that the progress made in addressing this problem is maintained. </p>  <p>  In this context, I have ring-fenced and prioritised the allocation of one million euro from the 2020 Anti-Dumping Initiative to combat illegal dumping activities associated with these challenging times and local authorities have been informed accordingly. Funding will be provided for monitoring and surveillance of dumping black-spots, removal of illegally deposited waste and any other measures that will prevent this activity and catch the perpetrators involved. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that Government has designated waste collection as an essential service and that measures taken by my Department, working in conjunction with industry and other regulatory authorities, has ensured the continued operation and availability of these services across all local authorities.</p></reply>

With respect to an objective on increasing accessibility and social inclusion, it is a requirement that the project appraisal set out and account for the expected impacts of the proposed transport investment in respect of vulnerable groups, this encompasses persons with disabilities. </p><p>In evaluating and prioritising investment, it is a requirement to identify the need for a scheme and to outline its objectives. For transport projects, the objectives must fall under six main criteria.  In relation to the equality impact of transport investments, one of these is &lsquo;Accessibility and Social Inclusion&rsquo;. This refers to a transport scheme&rsquo;s ability to impact upon a community&rsquo;s access to services and social amenities.  These criteria form the high level criteria for appraising the expected benefits and impact of the scheme. Sponsoring agencies preparing business cases for transport schemes are required to consider and assess if any accessibility impacts for the general public and in particular, vulnerable groups&mdash;either positive or negative&mdash;are likely to arise as a result of the investment. Such vulnerable groups include, for example, those experiencing social deprivation, geographic isolation, physical or intellectual  impairment. It is required that, to the extent that is possible, the scale of the anticipated impacts is set out within the appraisal, along with the specific groups likely to be impacted and how many people in those groups are likely to be impacted. </p><p>In respect of the requirements outlined above, I also note that the Strategic Research and Analysis Division in my Department is currently undertaking a work programme to review, update and improve the Departments existing sectoral guidance (the Common Appraisal Framework for Transport Projects and Programmes 2016).  This review and update will reflect the new requirements for evaluating, planning and measuring public investment as set out in the recently revised Public Spending Code published at the end of 2019. It also includes an examination of current approaches to measuring the impacts of projects or service changes to identify improvements that can be made. I expect that an updated Common Appraisal Framework will be published in the second half of 2020. </p><p>Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, the Public Sector Duty, as provided for in Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, places a legal obligation on all public bodies, including<i></i>all central government departments, to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees and everyone affected by their functions and services. </p><p>To meet our Public Sector Duty, my Department has established an implementation group which is carrying out an assessment to identify human rights and equality issues, including disability issues that are relevant to the functions of my Department, as a policy maker, employer and service provider. The assessment will also identify the policies and practices that are in place, or any additional measures that may be required to address these issues.</p></reply>

Costs also vary based on the location of the after-school service, as this impacts on the cost of land,  and the costs and availability of builders to carry out the works.</p><p>My Department operates an annual Capital Programme under which early learning and care and school aged childcare providers are invited to apply for capital supports for building works, including after-school care.  Grants issued under the Capital Programme are not based on a set amount for each place created, but are calculated based on the costings submitted by the applicant.</p><p>Last December I announced the details of the 2020 capital funding programme with &euro;7.2m being made available for the Early Learning and Care and School Age Capital programmes, an increase of over &euro;1million on the 2019 capital programme for this sector.</p><p>Due to the COVID-19 closure of childcare facilities, the 2020 Capital Programme has been suspended,  but is being kept under review. </p><p>Childcare was identified as a strategic priority under the National Development Plan and &euro;250m was committed to the development of additional, high quality, childcare capacity.</p></reply>

The levying of commercial rates is the responsibility of the Valuations Office, which falls under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  As such, and as my Department does not hold data in respect of commercial rates, I am not in a position to provide an estimated cost of exempting early learning and care providers from commercial rates.</p>  <p>  However, my Department has made considerable investment in the provision of affordable and accessible quality childcare, and I am conscious that the issue of commercial rates may be a barrier to achieving these goals.</p>  <p>  The issue of commercial rates has been regularly raised by the sector, in particular through the National Early Years Forum, which I established in 2016.  My Department has taken a number of steps to pursue this matter, including meeting with relevant officials to explore the possibility of obtaining an exemption of the application of commercial rates to private childcare providers, on the basis that they are educational facilities. Services which operate the ECCE programme only ( free pre-school) are already exempt.</p>  <p>  Further efforts in this regard included my writing to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, requesting reconsideration of the position of private childcare facilities in respect of their rateability for commercial rates.  It was confirmed that there are no proposals under consideration for a discount of commercial rates for private childcare providers, and that the Commissioner of Valuation has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4 of the Act. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has agreed to suspend commercial rates for  businesses most immediately impacted by Covid-19, including childcare facilities, for three months.   This is just one of a suite of measures the Government has put into place to support the early years learning and care sector in these  unprecedented times.</p></reply>

The FSA's constituent programmes, including the FRC Programme, were transferred to Tusla.  </p>  <p>  In 2008, a total of &euro;18.94 million in funding was allocated to the FRC Programme, supporting 107 Family Resource Centres across the country. This represents the peak level of annual funding for the FRC Programme, as referred to by the Family Resource Centre National Forum.</p>  <p>  The funding allocation to the FRC Programme in 2020 is &euro;18 million. To increase funding to 2008 levels would therefore require an additional &euro;0.94 million. </p>  <p>  There are currently 121 Family Resource Centres funded by Tusla under the FRC Programme. To increase funding to 2008 levels, on an average per centre basis, would require funding of approximately &euro;21.3 million annually, or an additional &euro;3.3 million over the current budget allocation.</p></reply>

Ensuring that this fund is appropriately accounted for, and that as many children as possible benefit from it, is one of the core responsibilities of my Department. Pobal administers the beneficiary funding element on behalf of my Department and ensures good governance and strong compliance with the rules of the schemes. </p><p>Subsidies for all ELC and SAC programmes are based on child attendance, a key governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible. Where, during a compliance visit, Pobal discovers that the actual attendance of a child does not match that child&rsquo;s registration on Pobal&rsquo;s Programme Implementation Platform (PIP, Pobal's IT system), the service will be advised to make the necessary corrections to registrations to ensure that the total amount of funding received for the programme year is correct. An appropriate amount of flexibility is applied to this corrections process and Pobal works with services on a case-by-case basis in this regard.</p><p>CCS rules have been updated in recent years to clearly link funding to actual attendance during a snapshot period. This reflects the importance of safeguarding Exchequer finances and brought this scheme in line with the other schemes offered by my Department, which are also linked to child attendance. </p><p>My officials and Pobal actively monitor services&rsquo; compliance with scheme rules, potential recoupment and the impact of this activity on a service's sustainability. This includes regular reporting on compliance findings, including potential recoupments due to non-compliance. Pobal, the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs), along with officials from my Department, support and work with services to ensure compliance with the scheme rules and to support continued sustainability of services who may be affected by compliance activity.</p><p>Based on data provided by Pobal, the total value of overclaims identified during compliance visits in 2018/19 on the CCS scheme, by county, is set out below. Please note that this relates to overclaims found through a fair and objective process, and not to recoupments.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Overclaims identified during compliance visits <br /><br />(&euro;)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>60,127</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>13,579</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>92,522</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>39,965</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>38,358</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>1,279,143</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>180,546</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>147,623</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>19,792</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>138,158</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>70,794</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>15,724</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>444,402</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>26,408</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>49,768</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>63,371</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>48,248</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>55,195</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>12,369</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>4,881</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>89,723</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>54,060</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>144,063</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>89,695</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>62,629</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>5,467</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>3,246,610 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Where a compliance visit identified that attendance during the four-week snapshot period was less than the PIP registration for that period, the provider was required to make amendments to PIP registrations, which would affect the value of their CCS contract for the year. These figures provide an estimate of the value of the changes to PIP registrations on CCS required as a result of compliance activity. Since CCS funding for the programme year was set by attendance during this snapshot period, these are annualised figures.</p><p>Where an overclaim is identified, services are required to make corrections to PIP registrations and future funding is adjusted to ensure that the overall level of funding provided across the year is correct. Funding is based on attendance during a snapshot period, and any overclaim is looked at on an annual basis. As a result, the annualised overclaim consists of two parts: the amount overpaid up to the point of the compliance visit and therefore recouped; and the potential overclaim amount that would have occurred had it not been corrected for the period after the compliance visit. The overclaims identified figures provided above are the combination of the two. Funding payments are made in instalments and corrections can be made at various times during the year. </p><p>It should be noted that, where services were required to make corrections to their CCS registrations, they had the opportunity to reregister children onto CCSP. CCSP offers the same rate of subvention as CCS did, but allows for a greater degree of flexibility for service providers and parents. It allows for the level of attendance registered on PIP to be adjusted throughout the year to reflect the ongoing pattern of attendance. The availability of this option ensured that services would not lose out in instances where children under-attended during the snapshot window but later began to attend at a higher level. It also means that a portion of the overclaims identified (as shown in the table above) is likely not to have materialised, since a child could be moved off CCS and onto CCSP, thus ending the overclaim on CCS. </p><p>Pobal have calculated that a total of 3,144 registrations required updating following a compliance visit on CCS for the 2018/19 programme cycle. As previously outlined, services are required to update registrations when the registered level on PIP differs from the actual pattern of attendance of the child. The figures supplied do not indicate a scenario where children had hours reduced; rather they count instances where CCS registrations needed updating in order to match actual attendance during the snapshot period. </p><p>It is important to note that the compliance activity should not result in any child having any service withdrawn, rather it strives to ensure that the service provider only claims from my Department for the hours the child is attending. Data available to my Department shows that the number of children accessing Government subsidies continues to increase. </p><p>While CCS has been closed, CCSP will continue to operate for the foreseeable future for any children that were registered before 15th November 2019. CCSP is now closed to new entrants families can avail of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS).</p><p>The NCS has marked another significant milestone for ELC and SAC in this country, creating an infrastructure from which Government can further increase investment in services over the next decade. The NCS enables Government to annually / incrementally build investment until it gets to target levels. The NCS enables Government to target this funding as it becomes available at particular groups, or indeed universally. The NCS is also a more user friendly system for parents and providers and the compliance regime has been designed to reflect the real-life attendance of children, the flexibility required, balanced against the continued need to protect Exchequer funding.</p></reply>

This would mean that their child attends for 9 hours of free early learning and care under the ECCE programme. The childcare provider would receive the ECCE subvention pro rata reduced to correspond with the 9 hours provided in this scenario. </p>  <p>  Service Providers must keep daily attendance records for each child attending and records must include the child&rsquo;s full name, date of attendance, time of child&rsquo;s arrival and time of child&rsquo;s departure.

A child must be aged 2 years and 8 months on or before 31 August in order to be eligible and can&rsquo;t turn 5 years and 6 months during the programme year. There is no provision for a third year.   </p>  <p>  For some children with special or additional needs, where attending preschool five days a week is not feasible, there is a facility to apply for an overage exemption. This overage exemption allows them split two years over three years. It was initially introduced when there was only one year of ECCE and before the Access and Inclusion Model was introduced to ECCE, providing a range of supports to children with disabilities and the pre-school. The overage exemption is governed by three guiding principles as follows:</p>  <p>  -  The child not reaching 6 years of age during the exemption year to comply with the school staring age (as per Educational Welfare Act, 2000)</p>  <p>  - A Letter of recommendation supplied from a specialist (NB: Not a GP/Public Health Nurse)</p>  <p>  - ECCE Allocation taken-i.e. if a child has already availed of two years they will not be eligible. </p>  <p>   My Department works jointly with the Department of Education and Skills with regard to matters such as this.

Investment in ELC and SAC has increased by 141% over the last five years.  However, I acknowledge that more investment will be needed.  Historic under-investment in early learning and care has created a situation that has no quick solution. </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented situation that has required a series of emergency responses from the Government. I am acutely aware of the particular impact this has had on ELC and SAC providers, practitioners, parents and children. I am also very conscious of the importance of the ELC and SAC sector for children&rsquo;s positive development and in terms of supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis. </p><p>As a direct response to the COVID-19 closure of ELC and SAC services, I launched the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) which is a very significant measure to support the sector. The aim of the TWSCS is threefold: </p><p>- to support the sustainability of the ELC and SAC sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; </p><p>- to provide parents with a reassurance that if their ELC and SAC provider signs up to the scheme, they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, and they will maintain their ELC / SAC place when services resume and</p><p>- to give Early Learning and Care practitioners security and to retain these vital Educators in the sector.</p><p>The TWSCS builds on the wider provisions by Government and recognises the unique place and importance of the ELC and SAC sector. </p><p>Before COVID-19, a number of schemes and supports were available or in development to support more accessible, affordable and high quality ELC and SAC. The new National Childcare Scheme established a sustainable platform to enable us to continue investing for years to come.  The Scheme is designed to be flexible, allowing income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates to be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.</p><p>Low pay and poor working conditions in the sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce.</p><p>I have been doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. My support for improved pay and conditions for ELC professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families. I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. When this process commences, I will be happy to work with trade unions to ensure that pay rates are appropriate in the sector. During the COVID-19 period, I have developed the TWSCS to directly support wages in the sector and protect the continuity of this valued and skilled workforce. </p><p>Overall, Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in ELC and SAC. Additional investment of &euro;63.6m will bring spending to &euro;638m in 2020, as noted a 141% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve. Specifically in Budget 2020, I secured increased funding for the Sustainability and Sectoral Employment Order Support Fund for the sector. This will see funding to support sustainability rising from &euro;1.7m to &euro;2.2m per annum. </p><p>In terms of policy approaches, my Department has set out its vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in <i>First 5, A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families 2019-2028</i>. Three specific projects I would draw your attention to under First 5 are the development of a new Funding Model for the sector, the Workforce Development Plan, and the reform of the regulatory and inspection regimes. </p><p>A key vehicle to ensure that significant additional investment in the sector delivers for children, families and the State will be a new Funding Model. This new Funding Model will provide mechanisms to deliver additional funding to ELC and SAC providers to ensure greater levels of affordability, quality and inclusion in their services.</p><p>An Expert Group to develop the new Funding Model for ELC and SAC was announced in September 2019 and commenced its work in October 2019.  The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area. The Expert Group&rsquo;s Terms of Reference includes to:</p><p>- Agree a set of guiding principles to underpin the new Funding Model for ELC and SAC</p><p>- Review the existing approach to funding ELC and SAC services by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in terms of its alignment with the guiding principles as well as effectiveness in delivering on the policy objectives of quality, affordability, accessibility and contributing to addressing disadvantage</p><p>- Drawing on international evidence, identify and consider options on how additional funding for ELC and SAC could be structured to deliver on the guiding principles and above policy objectives</p><p>- Agree a final report including a proposed design for a new Funding Model, with accompanying costings, risk analysis and mitigation and phased implementation plan (with funding likely to become available on an incremental basis) to recommend to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and ultimately Government.</p><p>The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in ELC and SAC systems, funding and quality; economics; and relevant policy experts from the Government Departments which will be involved in implementing the new Funding Model. A research partner, Frontier Economics, has been appointed to support the work of the Expert Group.</p><p>A consultation and engagement process to take account of the voices of providers, practitioners, parents and other stakeholders within the sector had to be postponed due to COVID-19 but will be commencing shortly. Further information on the Funding Model and its progress is available at: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie</p><p>First 5 also includes a commitment to establishing a Workforce Development Plan for the ELC and SAC sector which will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce. As part of this, an extensive consultation with the sector is planed to discuss a wide array of working conditions including pay.</p><p>Other recent measures I have taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff, whilst also addressing administrative demands include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for SAC which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.</p><p>Finally, under First 5 we have also committed to reform the ELC and SAC regulatory and inspection systems. This will include consideration of options for reforms to the registration and inspection of the sector to ensure a proportionate inspection regime and a more integrated approach to ELC and SAC.</p><p>My Department has made considerable investment in the sector in recent years. I want to preserve the fruits of this investment for children, families and our much valued ELC and SAC workforce and ensure that, when COVID- 19 has passed, we will have retained as many services, staff and places as possible and that we are moving progressively towards the vision outlined in First 5 which was unanimously welcomed by all stakeholders.</p></reply>

Each year a number of early years services also decide to close of their own volition. Where an early years service closes, they are also required, in line with these statutory provisions, to notify Tusla of their planned closure. </p><p>Tusla, as the independent statutory regulator, has responsibility for maintaining the Early Years register. All data collected by Tusla including information relating to new applications for registration and reported service cessations is collated and verified on a rolling quarterly basis. On this basis, the number of applications to register a new service received up to the end of 2019 was 142, with the number of reported cessations for the same period standing at 196.  Tusla can also confirm that, to date, no application for registration have been refused on the grounds of not meeting fire and planning requirements.  </p><p>Tusla does not systematically record or collate information in relation to the numbers of individual childcare places available per registered service and so is not in a position to provide the Deputy with the requested figures. Where such data is collected on inspection, this is primarily for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the prescribed adult-child ratios as set out in the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016.</p><p>Each year Pobal conducts research on behalf of my Department to examine a number of factors related to early learning and care and school age childcare services in Ireland, including the monitoring of capacity.  This is published in an annual Early Years Sector Profile. </p><p>I launched the 2018/2019 Early Years Sector Profile on 16 December 2019.  The Sector Profile indicates that, on a national basis, existing childcare capacity broadly meets current demand, although there are pockets of under supply in some localities. The following table outlines, places from the 2018/2019 sector profile. To note, this covers all services (not just preschools) and all children within a service, not just those funded under my Department&rsquo;s programmes. Further, the number of children on a waiting list is an indication of demand, however, as parents often place their child/children on multiple lists, this figure cannot be used to measure actual demand. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2018/2019</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Capacity</td>       <td>218,745</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enrolments</td>       <td>206,301</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Vacancies</td>       <td>12,444</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waiting list</td>       <td>23,187</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Pobal data indicates that overall capacity has continued to increase year on year over the last 5 years, with the average service now standing at 47 versus 33 five years ago. This has been supported by the 141% increase in investment  which has led to a doubling of the ECCE programme from one year to two years, twice as many children being eligible for State subsidies as before, and children with disabilities being supported to attend mainstream pre-school with the assistance of the AIM programme.</p></reply>

I am pleased with the high volume of applications received since the Scheme launched. To date, over 31,500 applications have been received, relating to over 40,900 children. Additionally, 3,646 childcare providers have contracted to participate in the Scheme. </p><p>The offline, paper based application process went live on 13<sup>th</sup>March 2020. Families can continue to opt to apply online for subsidies under the NCS, or, they may choose to apply offline, by requesting a paper application form from the NCS Parent Support Centre. </p><p>For most families, the quickest and easiest way to apply and receive a subsidy is by using the online application process. This requires a verified MyGovID account and families can apply directly at www.ncs.gov.ie. The innovative, purpose-built IT system of the NCS aims to process a universal application in a matter of minutes, and an income assessed application in a matter of days.</p><p>Alternatively, families who wish to apply for subsidies by post can contact the NCS Parent Support Centre on 01 906 8530 and the appropriate form ( based on their particular circumstances) will then be posted out for completion. It does not appear that there was pent up demand for the paper based system. As of end April, only 27 applications had been received.</p><p>Regarding the issue of backdating subsidies, it has always been communicated by my Department that subsidy awards are payable from the week they are claimed, and not the date of application. It is a key aspect of the scheme that all claims are paid in arrears based on the attendance of a child. As such, the child must be registered with a childcare provider and the provider must confirm that attendance. This is a key financial and governance control to ensure we are maximising the benefits of public monies and that the investment is following the child. </p><p>Further information and resources for parents are available at www.ncs.gov.ie. </p></reply>

On this basis and considering that the maximum amount of funding available under the most recent Learner Fund bursary in 2019 was &euro;750 per practitioner completing a degree, a further &euro;7.1 million of spending on the Learner Fund would be required if a further 35% of the staff working directly with children (approx. 9,400 practitioners) were to complete a Level 7 or 8 qualification, to achieve a 60% graduate-led workforce. However, this cost does not represent the full cost of achieving a 60% graduate-led workforce, as my Department only part-funds early learning and care practitioners to complete a higher qualification through the Learner Fund. The full cost is significantly higher, with the majority of the cost being borne by the practitioners themselves.

However, my Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991, and will examine foster care arrangements as part of this review. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge foster carers as the backbone of our child care services. Foster care is the preferred option in Ireland for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians, and approximately 91% of children in care at the end of December 2019 (the most recent date for which figures are available) were in foster care. More than a quarter of these children were placed with relative foster carers. </p>  <p>  The Foster Care Allowance is currently &euro;325 per week per child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week per child aged 12 and over. This payment was protected during recent economic hardships, and it is tax free. It is paid in respect of the child and is provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sporting activities. The allowance is not considered as means for Social Welfare purposes.</p>  <p>  Foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. It is important that foster carers have access to specialist services to meet the child's identified needs. Respite care for children may be arranged, if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training is compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high-quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding to the Irish Foster Care Association, which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a phone advice service.</p></reply>

I am also very conscious of the importance of the ELC and SAC sector, particularly in the context of the current conditions and with a view to supporting the economy as we move beyond this crisis.</p>  <p>  Recognising this, DCYA has introduced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) to support the childcare sector during the closure period. The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme was launched on 15 April. The TWSCS operates in conjunction with the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), which is expected to last up to 12 weeks from 26 March 2020.    </p>  <p>  The aim of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme is threefold: </p>  <p>  - to support the sustainability of the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) sector so that it is in a position to reopen after COVID-19; </p>  <p>  - to provide parents with a reassurance that they are not required to pay fees during this COVID-19 crisis, while providing them with reassurance that they will maintain places for their children; and</p>  <p>  - to give members of the ELC and SAC workforce security and retain these vital Educators in the sector. </p>  <p>  To achieve this there are three key elements to the new Scheme: </p>  <p>  (i) In addition to the wage subsidy provided by Revenue&rsquo;s TWSS, DCYA is topping-up wages of eligible ELC and SAC staff by the maximum additional payment an employer can make to receive full wage subsidy under the Revenue and DCYA schemes combined, to a limit of &euro;586 weekly pay in line with the Revenue scheme. </p>  <p>  (ii) Where a staff member&rsquo;s pre-12 March weekly wage was below the DEASP set rate for temporary Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP; currently &euro;350 per week), DCYA is, on a temporary basis, providing funding to be used to top-up eligible employees&rsquo; wages to the DEASP rate set for the PUP, meaning that all staff are encouraged to remain with their employer rather than sign on with the DEASP.  </p>  <p>  (iii) To reflect the unique circumstances of the sector, in addition to funding eligible staff wages up to the maximum additional payment an employer can make to receive the full wage subsidy under the Revenue and DCYA schemes combined up to the cap, services are receiving a further payment which is based on a percentage of their total eligible staff gross weekly pay to be used towards ongoing / non-deferrable operational costs</p>  <p>  To date, three preliminary TWSCS payments have been made under the scheme on 24 April, 1 May and 8 May to all providers who had signed up the scheme and backdated to 6 April. Details of how to sign up have been made available through the Pobal programme platform used by ELC and SAC providers. Prior to the introduction of the scheme, DCYA had continued to fund childcare providers under the existing subsidy schemes, including ECCE (free pre-school) and the National Childcare Scheme on an ex-gratia basis to 10 April.  Funding under these schemes has now been suspended. </p>  <p>  It was important to move to this new temporary funding model to support as many of the 4500 services as possible, not just those in receipt of significant State funding under the beneficiary schemes. The TWSCS repurposes existing ELC and SAC monies to layer on top of the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and to support the multiplicity of ELC and SAC provider types with varying ratios of State income and parental contribution.  </p>  <p>  By 10 May  over 3,700 childcare services, 82% of the total number, had signed up the TWSCS.  The scheme remains open for late entrants.</p>  <p>  Administration of the scheme is being managed by Pobal.  DCYA has issued comprehensive FAQs on the scheme to providers and their representative bodies. The TWSCS builds on the wider provisions by Government and also recognises the unique place and importance of the early education and childcare sector. </p>  <p>  Expert advice and support is available generally to services across the country through the 30 City and County Childcare Committees, Pobal and a number of funded Childcare Organisations.  The Department continues to work intensively with the sector.</p></reply>

The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce.</p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and hence cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff. I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families.</p>  <p>  The most recent data on pay and conditions indicates that the average pay is influenced by the level of a practitioner&rsquo;s qualifications. For example, the average pay rates for graduate workers is somewhat higher than for others working in the sector. Practitioners with Level 5 and Level 6 qualifications earned an average of &euro;11.42 and &euro;12.63 respectively in 2019. The average rates of pay for graduates at that time were &euro;13.93 for those with qualifications at Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications, &euro;13.45 for those with Level 8 qualifications, and &euro;15.18 for those with qualifications at Levels 9 or 10. Overall, the average hourly pay in early learning and care and school-age childcare was &euro;12.55, which was 3% higher than the year before. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare, resulting in a 141% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.</p>  <p>  My Department has set out its vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families. First 5 recognises that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality early learning and care and school-age childcare and seeks to build &lsquo;an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce that is supported and valued and reflects the diversity of babies, young children and their families&rsquo;. First 5 includes a commitment to achieve a graduate-led workforce, and last year I began a process of developing a Workforce Development Plan to achieve this and other workforce-related commitments in First 5.</p>  <p>  Delivering on a further commitment in First 5, last year I also appointed an expert group to examine the current model of funding for early learning and care and school-age childcare and its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services. </p>  <p>  I have actively encouraged the sector to seek a Sectoral Employment Order (SEO). An SEO must be initiated by a grouping representing the sector and my Department is ready to input to such a process, if and when the sector seeks it. Organisations requesting the commencement of such a process must show they are substantially representative of the sector. An SEO would provide for mandatory terms and conditions in the early learning and care and school age childcare sector, minimum rates of remuneration, and other conditions.</p>  <p>  Other recent measures I have taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff whilst also addressing administrative demands include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full-year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in continuous professional development (CPD).</p>  <p>  In terms of measures specifically targeted towards higher qualified staff, a Higher Capitation payment is offered within the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme. This additional capitation is paid to contracted services on fulfilling the requirements for graduate-led ECCE sessions. The ECCE Higher Capitation rate is currently equivalent to an additional &euro;11.25 per child per week of the ECCE programme year.</p></reply>

For many children in Ireland, a childminder plays a valued role in their early learning and care and overall well-being, often over many years. As the draft plannotes, the research evidence points to positive outcomes for children of quality childminding, which may be linked to consistency of carer and a low child-adult ratio. </p><p>I am very aware of the unique nature of a childminding service. The Draft Childminding Action Plan proposes to develop regulations and an inspection model that are specific and appropriate to childminding, and training that is specific to childminders, as well as to develop bespoke resources to support the quality of childminding provision, including through the development of staffed local networks to provide professional development and peer support.  </p><p>The draft plan was widely publicised on websites and social media, and through National Voluntary Organisations and City/County Childcare Committees. Following publication of the childminding action plan as a draft, my Department provided an extensive consultation process which included a call for submissions which had 14 responses, an online survey which had 471 responses, an Open Policy Debate, and 32 Focus Group consultations around the country. </p><p>The 32 focus groups were specifically designed to allow direct conversation with childminders about the proposed reforms. The focus groups were organised by the local City/County Childcare Committees with the help of the team of 6 regional Childminding Development Officers that I put in place last year. The dates chosen for each focus group meeting depended on local availability of facilitators and venues in each county. The focus groups were organised in evenings, to make it easier for childminders to take part. </p><p>All aspects of the consultation process - the focus groups, survey, Open Policy Debate, and submissions received - are being given full weight in the analysis of the consultation findings.</p></reply>

Accordingly, staff employed with funding under Level 7 of AIM are a shared resource for the pre-school room. </p>  <p>  The Early Years Services Regulations require that all staff who are employed by an early learning and care provider to work directly with children of pre-school age must hold, at a minimum, a major award at level 5 on the NFQ in Early Childhood Care and Education or a qualification deemed equivalent by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. The December 2016 amendment to the Regulations (S.I. no.632 of 2016) provided for exceptional cases in which an exemption from the Level 5 requirement may be made in the context of AIM. An example of a relevant situation is where a child with complex healthcare needs requires specialised health supports, such as nursing, in order to attend the pre-school. </p>  <p>  Tusla, the independent statutory regulator of pre-school services, has published a Quality and Regulatory Framework (QRF), which specifies how the Regulations will be interpreted by the Early Years Inspectorate. The QRF (section 2, paragraph 6) specifies that exemption under AIM from the qualification requirement requires an exemption letter from Pobal.</p>  <p>  This requirement for an exemption letter from Pobal is also specified in the Funding Agreement for the ECCE pre-school programme, which states, with reference to the Level 5 minimum qualification requirement, that "In exceptional cases, an exemption may be made under AIM, wherein a child with medically complex needs who is availing of AIM Level 7 requires specialised health supports, for example healthcare assistant or nursing care. An exemption may be granted by Pobal where it is considered that such specialist support is required and this may detail the qualification requirements or relevant specialist training of the staff member involved."</p></reply>

It aims to support children with disabilities to access and meaningfully participate in the ECCE universal pre-school programme. AIM is a child-centred model that involves seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the early learning and care setting. </p>  <p>  AIM's universal measures have supported the development of an inclusive culture in the sector. 97% of registered providers have developed an inclusion policy, and 6,250 participants from 3,000 services have taken part in Equality, Diversity and Inclusion training. </p>  <p>  To empower services to promote an inclusive culture in settings, the Leadership in Inclusion (LINC) programme was established  and in the last four years has had over 3,100 registered students. So far 2,230 practitioners have graduated from the LINC programme, of whom more then 1,900 have gone on to be Inclusion Co-Ordinators working in pre-school settings. AIM has also invested in the delivery of continuing professional development courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing e-learning. Currently over 1,100, 800 and 1,425 participants respectively have completed these courses. </p>  <p>  Targeted AIM supports focus on the needs of an individual child and over 12,500 children in 3,300 services have benefited from targeted AIM supports since 2016. These supports range from assistive equipment, to therapeutic supports and to additional assistance in the pre-school room.  </p>  <p>  AIM has won awards both at home and internationally. It has won a Civil Service Excellence Award, and most recently won an international award for innovative policy at this year&rsquo;s UN Zero Project Awards, in recognition of the programme&rsquo;s significant contribution to the inclusion of children with disabilities. The Zero Project focuses on the rights of persons with disabilities globally. AIM was one of 11 innovative policies selected from 465 policy submissions from around the globe. </p>  <p>  My Department has committed to conducting an end-of-year-three evaluation of the model. The evaluation shall, having regard to all levels of AIM, ascertain the impact and effectiveness of AIM from the perspective of all stakeholders &ndash; investigating insofar as possible outcomes, efficacy, efficiency, adaptability and sustainability. This evaluation is currently in the procurement phase. </p>  <p>  A whole-of-Government strategy to improve the lives of babies, young children and their families, First 5, commits to continue to roll out AIM to ensure the full inclusion of children with a disability in settings delivering the ECCE programme. As part of the end-of-year-three evaluation of AIM and, subject to evaluation findings and other relevant developments, First 5 commits to consideration of enhancements to, and/or extension of, AIM to, for example, all early learning and care services, all school-age childcare services and/or to children with additional needs other than a disability. Consideration will be given to this commitment following completion of the evaluation of AIM. </p></reply>

Since then, over &euro;48 million has been allocated to the Local Authorities to deliver the scheme.</p>  <p>  In March this year, I confirmed that a further &euro;10 million is being made available for the Local Improvement Scheme in 2020, with each Local Authority being provided with the same financial allocation as 2019.

Broadband Officers were appointed on foot of a recommendation of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce in 2016 and their posts are co-funded by my Department. </p><p>The Broadband Officers act as a single point of contact within their Local Authorities for the public, telecommunications companies and elected representatives on matters regarding telecommunications development.  They also act in a coordinating role within their Local Authorities and contribute to the formulation and delivery of national policy initiatives through their engagement with my Department.</p><p>The key focus of the Broadband Officers&rsquo; work is supporting the roll-out of the National Broadband Plan (NBP). They have been working with my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to identify and address any potential local barriers to the NBP roll-out, but also to drive demand for services and ensure that communities are ready to make the best use of broadband connectivity when it arrives to their areas.</p><p>In addition to the wider National Broadband Plan, Broadband Officers have been working to identify Broadband Connection Points (BCPs). BCPs are mainly publicly accessible buildings, such as sports clubs and community centres, and will be among the first premises connected under the National Broadband Plan.  BCPs will provide onsite access to communities with little or no connectivity ahead of the arrival of a permanent fibre connection.</p><p>On behalf of their Local Authorities, the Broadband Officers also lead on a number of initiatives aimed at improving regional connectivity and digital development, including the European Commission&rsquo;s WiFi4EU program and my Department&rsquo;s Digital Innovation Programme.</p><p>Broadband Officers have played a central and critical role in the marked increase in mobile phone and broadband accessibility across the State. They have engaged proactively with companies, community groups and representative groups to ensure that the public receive the services that they need. Their role has been singled out by industry leaders as one of the most significant drivers of national telecommunications development in recent years.</p><p>A list of Broadband Officers, including their contact details, is provided on the table below.

Communities throughout the country enjoyed a hugely successful Big Hello weekend, with over 800 events taking place as well as over 1,100 Street Feasts, one of our partners in this initiative. A wide and varied range of events took place. </p>  <p>  The success of the weekend could be seen vividly across social media, with photos and videos of communities celebrating together. The wide variety of events allowed something for everyone, from a cup of tea with neighbours, to picnics and barbecues to music and arts. Friendships were deepened, new ones were made, and the importance of neighbours connecting was highlighted.</p>  <p>  However, due to the many competing priorities in the Department&rsquo;s budget allocation, funding could not be allocated for The Big Hello in 2020.  A detailed report reviewing the process and documenting lessons learnt and recommendations for potential future initiatives was compiled and this will be of benefit in considering whether the concept should be revisited in future years.  </p></reply>

The Social Welfare (Consolidated) Act 2005, as amended, specifies that participation in activation meetings is mandatory for those in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance. </p>  <p>  The JobPath providers are obliged to provide a baseline level of support to each participant but are free to adapt that support in individual cases, provided that it is not unduly onerous.  The JobPath contracts provide that a person should not have to travel more than 60 minutes in normal circumstances to attend an appointment.  Where a person has transport difficulties, the JobPath provider can assist the person with travel arrangements tailoring the service around their particular travel requirements. </p>  <p>  JobPath providers give an immediate reimbursement for travel expenses upon production of a ticket/ evidence of travel.  Please note that fares are covered for the cheapest travel method available and taxi fares are generally not refunded.  Clients should present their ticket/receipt and there should be no requirement to contact the Community Welfare Service in respect of JobPath costs. </p>  <p>  Currently, in line with all contracted activation services provided on behalf of the Department, the JobPath providers are delivering tele services only thereby negating the need for customers to attend the provider's offices.  This matter is under continual review and will be revised in line with general public health advice.</p>  <p>  Any person who is experiencing difficulties with transport which is affecting their ability to engage with the JobPath service should discuss the matter with their JobPath provider so that a solution can be found.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that any future changes in State pension age after 2035 will be based on research into life expectancy.</p>  <p>  There is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.  People are living longer and healthier lives.  Many of them may want to continue working after 65 and these resources can facilitate them in their choice.</p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age.  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming financial support from a date after their 65th birthday.

These include the Reasonable Accommodation Fund (RAF) which encompasses the following four grants:</p><p>1. Employee Retention Grant </p><p>2. Workplace Equipment / Adaptation Grant </p><p>3. Personal Reader Grant </p><p>4. Job Interview Interpreter Grant </p><p>The purpose of the Workplace Equipment/Adaptation Grant (WEAG) is to increase job opportunities for people with a disability by supporting any additional costs, related to the disability, incurred by private sector employers employing or retaining an employee with a disability.</p><p>The general principles of the scheme are that it:</p><p>- applies only to the additional costs of adapting workplace equipment or of the provision of equipment arising from the individual&rsquo;s disability.  It should not be used to provide support usually provided by employers or supports required under legislation for employees who do not have a disability;</p><p>- is a contribution towards the cost of an adaptation or of equipment up to a current limit of &euro;6,350.  It can also be used to upgrade adaptive equipment which may have been fundedpreviously.  Application in excess of this sum will be considered on an individual basis up to a maximum of &euro;9,523 if specialist training for the assistive technology is required;</p><p>- is not intended to meet the usual costs of setting up and running a business either for an employer or a self-employed person;</p><p>- will be treated as a grant; and</p><p>- may be used in part for training in the use of the grant-aided equipment.</p><p>Those eligible for receipt include:</p><p>- Any person with a disability who is about to take up employment with a private sector employer, change job as a result of re-deployment or promotion, or become self-employed, and who requires assistive technology or an adaptation to the workplace in order to undertake the duties required;</p><p>- Any person employed by a private sector employer who acquires a disability whilst in employment, whose employer is participating in the Employee Retention Grant Scheme (ERGS), and who requires assistive technology or an adaptation to the workplace in order to retain his/her employment;</p><p>- Any person with a disability who is employed by a private sector employer, whose condition deteriorates so that he/she requires new assistive technology or a further adaptation to the workplace in order to retain his/her employment.</p><p>The Community Employment (CE) scheme provides part-time work experience and training opportunities in local communities for people in receipt of a long term Social Welfare payment as a stepping stone back to employment.  It is important to note that community employment, does not, nor is it intended to, provide full-time sustainable employment.  As CE projects are funded by the Exchequer, participation on a CE scheme is not considered a private sector employment for the purpose of eligibility for WEAG. </p><p>The Department promotes the RAF grants through its general communications activities, employer engagement activity, Intreo service and its contracted employment service providers, such as the companies delivering EmployAbility services.  Administration of the application process, for the four RAF grants is through the Department's network of Intreo offices.  The Department is continually looking to improve its processes and communications and has committed to examining same relating to the RAF as part of its commitments within the revised Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES) Action Plan published by the Department of Justice and Equality (DJE) in December 2019.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The Department's Disability  Consultative Forum (DCF) which enables a two-way dialogue on theDepartments schemes and services, as they relate to customers with disabilities.  The forum provides a channel for the views and perspectives of people with disabilities and their representatives to be communicated to the Department, while also providing a mechanism to raise issues of concern and make recommendations which can influence policy formulation, service and scheme delivery.</p><p>2. The Pre-Budget Forum, which is held annually and provides an opportunity for organisations in the sector to discuss and debate policy issues and present their thoughts and views on the upcoming Budget to the Minister and senior departmental officials.  The forum is used to inform the annual Budget process.</p><p>3. Formal meetings with the community and voluntary sector which are convened twice a year.</p><p>4. Bi-lateral meetings with representative organisations. </p><p>This consultative framework ensures that stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback on budgetary, policy and operational matters related to schemes and services for people with disabilities.  </p><p>The National Council for the Blind Ireland (NCBI) has participated in the above consultation framework and the Department has written recently to the NCBI to seek a new nominee to attend DCF meetings.  </p><p>It should be noted that there is no requirement that work must be of a rehabilitative nature with regards to the blind pension.  </p><p>Any proposed increases to payments, such as to the disability allowance or blind pension, will be considered in the context of the annual budget process.

This is the first step in reaching an in-depth understanding of this complex issue.  </p><p>Indecon International Consultants have been commissioned to carry out the research and are expected to submit a final report later this year.  Their work programme to date has included the following elements:</p><p>- An review of existing international research, including approaches to defining &lsquo;cost of disability&rsquo; and government responses to costs of disability. </p><p>- Examination of submissions from representative organisations.

As part of the stakeholder engagement element of the research, a survey will shortly be issued to 33,000 recipients of DEASP disability-related payments, including people who are blind or visually impaired.  This will be followed up by structured interviews with a small sample of persons with a disability or with their families.  This very large sample is designed to ensure that the different costs incurred by individuals with a disability are taken into account. </p><p>It is expected that this research, when complete later this year, will inform policy direction in the future &ndash; from a whole-of-Government perspective &ndash; in relation to the adequate provision of support to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including those who are blind or visually impaired.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Officials from my department have visited all schools participating in the pilot to provide support and take feedback in relation to all aspects of the pilot.  In general, the response to the pilot from teachers, parents and pupils has been very positive.

The on going payment of Mortgage Interest Supplement did not address the long term housing challenges for people in serious mortgage arrears; and,</p>  <p>  2. The Central Bank's Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides for an appropriate framework for customers, with the responsibility of forbearance for a customer&rsquo;s mortgage difficulties resting with the mortgage service provider. </p>  <p>  The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported remains through on-going engagement with their lender to explore a sustainable and appropriate response from their lending institution. </p>  <p>  Under the CCMA (2013), measures and policies are in place to support customers in financial difficulty with their mortgage commitments.  The CCMA is issued by the Central Bank under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and ensures that the responsibility of forbearance remains with the mortgage service provider. </p>  <p>  The CCMA provides support for those that are in: arrears, pre-arrears or those who fall under scope of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP). Under the CCMA, lending institutions are encouraging customers to contact them at the earliest opportunity regarding their concerns and any particular circumstances which may impact on the customer&rsquo;s financial well-being. </p>  <p>  A cross-industry co-ordination Group, chaired by Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI), is looking at all coronavirus related issues that may impact customers.  This includes both the overall economic impact of the coronavirus situation and its direct effect on customers.  A number of emergency measures have also been announced by individual lending bodies including increased overdraft facilities and increased credit card and cash withdrawal limits.</p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens Information Board, also continues to provides assistance to people, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments, who are over-indebted and need help and advice with debt problems.  As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Firstly, an increase in the age limits could result in a cohort of lone parents that are currently not in receipt of a social welfare payment becoming eligible, and therefore moving onto a social welfare payment.  As members of this cohort are not currently in receipt of a social welfare payment it would be difficult to for the Department to estimate the numbers involved. </p>  <p>  Secondly, some customers could seek to move from alternative payments such as Jobseekers Allowance, the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment and the Back to Work Family Dividend back to the OFP.  Again, it would be difficult for the Department to estimate the potential magnitude of this flow between schemes with any degree of accuracy. </p>  <p>  Thirdly, such changes would also increase the incidence of dual payments of OFP and the Working Family Payment.  It is not possible to predict the impact on payments as a result of the interaction between both schemes without having detailed knowledge of individuals&rsquo; working patterns and the degree to which these might change.  </p>  <p>  These factors are critical to providing a reliable costing.

Class S contributions do not provide access to short-term social insurance benefits such as illness benefit.  However, the means tested supplementary welfare allowance scheme may be available to those who are experiencing financial difficulty. </p>  <p>  Self-employed contributors have been covered for invalidity pension since December 2017.  This gives the self-employed access to a safety-net of income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of a long-term illness or disability without a means test. </p>  <p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to keep under review the further extension of benefits to self-employed people.  In doing this, it will take account of results of the 2017 survey of self-employed workers, which indicated that self-employed people are open to paying a higher rate of social insurance in return for additional benefits, and the actuarial review of the social insurance fund which was undertaken by KPMG.  This review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions was estimated to be &euro;223 million for 2020.  </p>  <p>  I would like to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the announcement made by the Taoiseach on 2 March 2020 in relation to providing self-employed people with financial assistance, where they are required to self-isolate as a probable source of infection within the public health guidelines or where they have a medically confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 .  </p>  <p>  This assistance has been provided for under emergency legislation Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 and subsequent regulations. </p>  <p>  Any plans to extend illness benefit to self-employed persons in other illness situations would have to be considered in the overall budgetary policy and budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Employees who are laid off temporarily, without pay, due to a reduction in business activity, can apply for a jobseekers payment.</p>  <p>  Many employers can, and do, agree compassionate leave arrangements with staff who need to take short periods of time off to care for another person.  These include arrangements to enable employees to work remotely from home, to alter shift-patterns, to work-up time taken, to rearrange parental leave or to bring forward annual leave entitlements from future work-periods. </p>  <p>  Where it is not possible to make appropriate compassionate leave arrangements, employees can call on some statutory entitlements.  An employee is entitled to paid leave, known as force majeure leave, to provide urgent care for an immediate family relative.  It is limited to a total of three days in a 12 month period or five days in a 36 month period.  In the exceptional circumstances of Covid-19 it is expected that employers will, if at all possible, facilitate people by allowing them to take the full 5 days entitlement in one block, as required.</p>  <p>  Parents are also entitled, with 6 weeks&rsquo; notice, to take parents leave of 2 weeks for each child under 1 year of age born on or after 1 November 2019 and are eligible to apply for Parents Benefit from the Department.  Again, employers are free to waive the notice period or to agree to provide paid leave as an alternative to Parents leave.  Employers can also agree alternative leave/absence arrangements.</p>  <p>  Assistance is available under the Department's supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme for employees whose earnings are affected by Covid-19 and who have needs that they cannot meet from their weekly income or own resources.

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The fuel allowance is an important measure that assists pensioners and other welfare dependent householders to address income deficiency, especially during the winter when a household faces increased heating needs.  The duration of the scheme is designed to coincide with the coldest periods of the year and it is for this reason the scheme runs from October to mid-April. </p>  <p>  In the context of the COVID-19 emergency, the Government has already allocated c. &euro;2.4 billion in a package of social protection measures.  For example, enhanced Illness Benefit is available for employees or self-employed people who are medically required to self isolate or medically diagnosed with Covid-19.  The personal rate of Illness Benefit has increased from &euro;203 per week to &euro;350 per week for such persons and the 6 day waiting period has been removed making payment available from the first certified day of illness.  In addition to this, the normal social welfare conditionality requirements for access to Illness Benefit do not apply to these employees.  Furthermore, self-employed persons who would not normally be able to access Illness Benefit will also be in a position to receive this income support.  These measures will enable self-employed people or other workers who do not have the necessary social insurance history to receive the increased payment without having to undergo a means test. </p>  <p>  As well as the above measures, I was delighted to announce on the 31st March that, in order to support vulnerable households during the COVID-19 emergency, especially at this time where the Government wishes people to stay at home to stay safe, the fuel season will be extended by four weeks for existing eligible customers on a once-off basis.</p>  <p>  This extends the payment of &euro;24.50 per week to c. 373,570 households from Friday 10 April (when it was due to expire) until Friday 8 May 2020 and will provide these vulnerable households with additional targeted financial supports in a timely, efficient and time bound manner.</p>  <p>  In addition to the extension of the fuel allowance season, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances.  Exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet from his / her own resources. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It should be noted that not all classes of PRSI are reckonable for state pension purposes including Classes B and D, the rate at which most public servants hired prior to 6 April 1995 pay, including those who worked in semi state organisations such as An Post.</p>  <p>  Provisions also exist for the award of a mixed insurance pro rata state pension, where a person has substantial periods of PRSI coverage that are not reckonable for pension purposes.

This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance.  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension.</p>  <p>  Corporate governance of An Post is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

The increased use of mobile technology, which is already a well-established aspect of the modern workforce, has enabled many workers to remain connected and in employment, despite the closure or reduction of workspaces.  </p><p>However, a long-acknowledged, potential downside to the use of mobile and other electronic communication devices is the expectation that workers are always &lsquo;switched on&rsquo;. </p><p>First and foremost, Ireland already has a comprehensive body of employment legislation, including the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which sets out maximum working time and minimum rest periods for employees.  It is understood that proper compliance with that Act should in fact be sufficient to ensure an appropriate work-life balance. </p><p>Where an individual believes they are being deprived of their employments rights, they may refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication, leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.</p><p>That said, there has been significant debate across Europe in recent years regarding the &lsquo;right to disconnect&rsquo; and Government officials have been monitoring the matter closely. </p><p>Officials from my Department met with Eurofound earlier this year to discuss its report &ldquo;Telework and ICT-based mobile work; flexible working in the digital age&rdquo;, which examines, <i>inter alia</i>, the right to disconnect throughout the EU.  The report found that only a few Member States have adopted legislation related to the &lsquo;right to disconnect&rsquo; and that there is a lack of consensus about the need for legislation in the area and how it should be regulated.</p><p>The topic was also discussed at the most recent Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF), following which I wrote to ICTU and IBEC seeking submissions in order to contribute to the debate.  </p><p>Officials in the Department of Justice and Equality have also conducted a public consultation on the broader theme of developing a national flexible working policy.  The policy will take into account the needs of families, individuals, employers and the broader economy.  The results of the consultation are currently being analysed and I look forward to its publication. </p><p>In December 2019, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation published the 'Remote Work in Ireland' Report.  The report focussed on understanding the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements.  It identified the need for further guidance for employers to support the adoption of remote work across a number of areas, including the right to disconnect.  The WRC is the primary source of information on employment rights in Ireland.</p><p>My Department continuously monitors existing employment rights legislation to ensure that it continues to be relevant and fit for purpose.  My officials will continue to do so in relation to the right to disconnect and will strive to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the exigencies of businesses, organisations and workers.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

This very comprehensive report presents an examination of the vulnerability for workers, firms and sectors to the transition to a low-carbon and more digital, automated future. </p>  <p>  In framing it recommendations, NESC sets out the proposed drivers to the Government&rsquo;s response to the employment vulnerability created by transitions.  These drivers are: continuous, pre-emptive workforce development; building resilient enterprises; and delivering high-impact targeted funding to support transition.  The 12 strategic recommendations, in turn, address issues pertaining to policy, implementation and communication.  These include increasing Ireland&rsquo;s ambition for workforce development, extending appropriate enterprise supports to viable but vulnerable firms, and examining the inclusion of social clauses in relevant state transition funding.</p>  <p>  The Council&rsquo;s report underlines the importance of lifelong learning, training and education, effective support for viable but vulnerable companies, and ensuring that funding has the greatest possible local impact.</p>  <p>  The transition to a low-carbon and more digital, automated future will present challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s economy and labour market, particularly for vulnerable but viable firms and their employees.  My Department will continue to work with the Departments for Education and Skills and Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the development of the labour force and providing opportunities for jobseekers, as the economy transitions to a low carbon and more digital automated future.</p>  <p>  As you will be aware, I established a Labour Market Advisory Council earlier this year with a mandate that includes providing advice on general employment and labour market issues.

This very comprehensive report presents an examination of the vulnerability for workers, firms and sectors to the transition to a low-carbon and more digital, automated future. </p>  <p>  In framing it recommendations, NESC sets out the proposed drivers to the Government&rsquo;s response to the employment vulnerability created by transitions.  These drivers are: continuous, pre-emptive workforce development; building resilient enterprises; and delivering high-impact targeted funding to support transition.  The 12 strategic recommendations, in turn, address issues pertaining to policy, implementation and communication.  These include increasing Ireland&rsquo;s ambition for workforce development, extending appropriate enterprise supports to viable but vulnerable firms, and examining the inclusion of social clauses in relevant state transition funding.</p>  <p>  The Council&rsquo;s report underlines the importance of lifelong learning, training and education, effective support for viable but vulnerable companies, and ensuring that funding has the greatest possible local impact.</p>  <p>  The transition to a low-carbon and more digital, automated future will present challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s economy and labour market, particularly for vulnerable but viable firms and their employees.  My Department will continue to work with the Departments for Education and Skills and Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the development of the labour force and providing opportunities for jobseekers, as the economy transitions to a low carbon and more digital automated future.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are continuing to engage with the Department of Education and Skills on how best to engage the higher education institutions and to provide for the delivery of the skills identified as being critical in Report No. 19 by the NESC.</p></reply>

A range of key design priorities are emphasised in the guidelines, including the need to ensure designs are socially, environmentally and architecturally appropriate, safe, secure and healthy; affordable; durable; and accessible and adaptable. Such themes are amplified in the later <i><i>Design Manual for Urban Spaces</i></i>(DMURS).</p><p>These design guidelines for local authorities seek to promote quality and value for money in publicly funded housing and seek to maintain this level of quality, including where other funding streams are fully or partially involved.</p><p>In relation to the guidelines, my Department is in regular contact with local authorities where design proposals for social housing developments are considered for consistency with the Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities guidelines and I am satisfied that the appropriate arrangements are in place.</p><p>In regard to the DMURS, this was jointly published by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2013 and was followed by a series of nationwide information seminars in early 2014 and 2015.  The purpose of this manual is to ensure that the welfare and needs of pedestrians are prioritised in the design of streets in urban areas, so that roadways for cars do not dominate our towns and cities. It also promotes systems to better facilitate and encourage pedestrian movement, and is fully consistent with our planning intentions to create more compact settlements. </p><p>The manual contains specific design guidance intended to assist persons with visual impairment navigate public spaces, specifically in respect of clear pathways, reduced clutter, street furniture in specific zones, and the use of tactile pavement and contrasting materials to aid navigation.</p><p>My Department is committed to actively engaging with all key stakeholders to facilitate the delivery of better homes, better neighbourhoods and better urban spaces. </p></reply>

Responsibility for the provision of emergency accommodation and related services for homeless persons is a matter for the local authorities. </p>  <p>  As part of the response to COVID-19, my Department is working closely with the Dublin Regional Homelessness Executive (DRHE), local authorities and the HSE to ensure the necessary arrangements are in place to protect individuals and families accessing emergency accommodation. This has included regular meetings and conference calls with the DRHE, local authorities and the Chief Executives of homeless NGOs. My Department is also working with the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) subgroup for vulnerable persons. </p>  <p>  Local authorities nationally have been working to put in place additional accommodation to allow for the isolation of confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.  Significant additional accommodation is also in place to support the appropriate levels of social distancing in emergency accommodation.  In Dublin, where over 70% of all homeless individuals are located, over 1,000 additional beds have been put in place to ensure adherence to HSE guidance, in addition to providing beds for individuals in emergency accommodation who are required to self-isolate.   Outside Dublin, additional beds are also in place, or available for use, for the same purpose.  The DRHE has also confirmed to my Department that all hostels in Dublin are operating on 24-hour basis and that meals are being provided. Additional funding is being provided to local authorities to deliver these measures.  </p>  <p>  My Department does not hold details of individuals in emergency accommodation who are sharing a bedroom. </p></reply>

Of the 30 projects, Kildare County Council has confirmed that its project on the Naas Inner Relief Road will not now progress, although  an element of the housing that was associated with the project has taken place. </p><p>Details of the approvals by local authority area, budget allocation, project description and projected housing delivery are available at .</p><p>Currently, 3 LIHAF projects have completed infrastructure construction. Of the remaining 26, up to the end of April (and excluding the Naas project), 14 projects have been approved to go to, or are already at, infrastructure construction stage.  Of the remaining 12 projects, 3 are expected to have tenders approved and go to construction before the end of Q3 2020.  Nine are not yet ready to go to infrastructure tender stage which is required in order to receive approval to proceed to construction.  My Department is reviewing these projects and considering requests from local authorities for extensions to the funding agreements as and when they arise. </p><p>In terms of LIHAF funding drawdown, thus far, most infrastructure projects have been at the design, planning and procurement stages, and the bulk of expenditure will arise during the construction phase.  This is reflected in the level of expenditure to end Q1 2020, with approximately &euro;37.731 million in Exchequer funds drawn down (matched by a further 25% local authority funding bringing the total expenditure to &euro;50.308m).

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  In February 2016, my Department announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on an annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres. </p>  <p>  The Cappamore Station Project is included under the 2016 &ndash; 2020 Capital Programme. In order to maximise the Capital Programme funding available, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the capital programme on an annual basis and priority may be adjusted to bring forward more advanced projects offering best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects in the programme more generally.</p>  <p>  In 2017, my Department approved a new drill tower at Cappamore fire station for which Limerick City and County Council was reimbursed just under &euro;52,000. My Department has received a design and outline cost proposal from the Council for redevelopment of the fire station at Cappamore.

This funding will provide for infrastructure to support the delivery of some 6,200 more affordable homes on local authority lands.  SSF has been made available to local authorities who have demonstrated a requirement for more affordable housing and a viability to deliver such housing on their sites. </p><p>Land utilisation and activation is, in the first instance, a matter for the local authority and its elected members. This includes the development of its land for the delivery of more affordable private housing. In order to target SSF funding interventions, local authorities were invited to undertake an economic assessment of their sites to assess whether the provision of affordable homes was necessary and economically viable.  As part of that assessment local authorities were also asked to consider the broader housing affordability within their area.  19 local authorities returned economic assessments to my Department.</p><p>To date, I have allocated SSF funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, for infrastructure works that will facilitate the delivery of almost 3,200 more affordable homes.  I anticipate that a further Call for Proposals under the SSF will issue to local authorities later this year.  Details of the projects approved under the 1<sup>st</sup>and 2<sup>nd</sup>SSF calls are available at the following links: </p><p>Homes delivered under the SSF are subject to the provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which was commenced in June 2018.  This legislation now provides the statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase in the State. Regulations in respect of the making of Schemes of Priority were signed on 12 March 2019, and these were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level.  This includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  </p><p>In line with the legal requirements of the Affordable Dwelling Purchase Arrangements, further regulations will be put in place over the coming months regarding eligibility and other matters. When the operational procedures for the scheme are finalised, and before dwellings are made available for purchase under the scheme, a programme of communication will be undertaken by my Department and local authorities.</p><p>In order to be eligible for affordable dwelling purchase arrangements, a household&rsquo;s income must be such that it is inadequate to meet the repayments on a mortgage for the purchase of a dwelling to meet the accommodation needs of the household, because the payments calculated over the course of a year would exceed 35% per cent of the annual income of the household (net of income tax and pay related social insurance).  Eligibility is also generally limited to first time buyers.  The maximum discount on market value that may be given to an eligible purchaser is 40%.</p><p>When a dwelling is made available to a purchaser under an affordable dwelling purchase arrangement a charging order is made by the housing authority.  This places a charge on the dwelling with an amount equal to the difference between the purchase money and the market value of the dwelling. Payments may be made by the purchaser to reduce this amount during the charged period.  The amount outstanding on the charge must be repaid in full at the end of the charged period.</p><p>The selling price of discounted dwellings made available for purchase by a housing authority under the affordable dwelling purchase arrangements will be influenced by a number of factors, particularly the overall development costs of the homes (taking into account subvention inputs such as the local authority land value and Serviced Sites Fund), which can vary significantly from one site to another, the tenure mix involved and the local housing market.</p><p>In addition to the SSF, funding of &euro;200m has also been made available under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), which is designed to activate housing supply by putting in place the enabling public infrastructure necessary to ensure that large scale development could take place on key sites in urban areas of high housing demand.  30 projects received final approval, at a total cost of &euro;195.71 million, of which &euro;146.69 million will be funded by the Exchequer, with local authorities funding the balance.  These projects will stimulate development of up to 20,000 homes across 14 local authorities and local authorities have indicated that approximately 40% of the homes delivered will be offered at a discount on open market prices.<i></i></p><p>Details of the projects approved under LIHAF are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p>The Land Development Agency also has a role in the delivery of more affordable housing and a minimum of 30% of housing on LDA sites must be affordable, with the balance contributing to additional new supply to meet the high levels of demand in the wider housing sector.

While every application for a mortgage would be assessed on its own merits, banks and other lending institutions do have the freedom to make a limited amount of exceptions to lending limits.  For those who find themselves unable to secure a commercial mortgage, local authorities nationwide operate the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme (RIHL), which enables credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.</p><p>In addition to the RIHL, the Help to Buy (HTB) incentive was first introduced in February 2015 and is designed to help first-time buyers of newly built homes to assemble the required deposit.  The HTB scheme provides for a refund of income tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid over the previous 4 tax years, up to a maximum of &euro;20,000. 17,200 first time buyers households have been supported to buy or build homes since the inception of the HTB Scheme and, in Budget 2020, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform extended the initiative in its current form until 31 December 2021.</p><p>Other supply side measures are also in place to address the issue of affordability.In line with the commitments in Rebuilding Ireland to support the delivery of discounted homes to buy or rent, the Government has allocated &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) over the period 2019 to 2021.  This funding will provide for infrastructure to support the delivery of some 6,200 more affordable homes on local authority lands.  the SSF has been made available to local authorities who have demonstrated a requirement for more affordable housing and a viability to deliver such housing on their sites.</p><p>To date, I have allocated SSF funding of &euro;127 million, in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, for infrastructure works that will facilitate the delivery of almost 3,200 more affordable homes.  I anticipate that a further Call for Proposals under the SSF will issue to local authorities in 2020. Details of the projects approved under the 1<sup>st</sup>and 2<sup>nd</sup>SSF calls are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following links:</p><p>Taking, as an example, the first of these developments in Boherboy Road, Cork City, which will see delivery of SSF supported homes this year, I can confirm that an individual or couples on salary levels equivalent to that of a secondary school teacher(s) would be in a position to buy the 2 and 3 bed homes at the prices ranging from &euro;195,000 to &euro;225,000. I can also confirm that SSF grant funding to date includes a project in Ramsfort Park, Gorey, Co. Wexford, which will support the delivery of 23 affordable homes.</p><p>The timing of delivery for SSF projects is contingent upon the completion of planning and procurement in the first instance, and local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible.  It is intended to issue a 3rd call for proposals under the SSF to local authorities later this year.</p><p>In tandem with the SSF, funding of &euro;200m has also been made available under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), which is also designed to activate housing supply by putting in place the enabling public infrastructure necessary to ensure that large scale development could take place on key sites in urban areas of high housing demand.  30 projects received final approval, at a total cost of &euro;195.71 million, of which &euro;146.69 million will be funded by the Exchequer with local authorities funding the balance.  These projects will stimulate development of up to 20,000 homes across 14 local authority areas and the local authorities involved have indicated that approximately 40% of the homes delivered will be offered at a discount on open market prices.  Details of the projects approved under LIHAF are available at the following link:</p><p>In addition to the provision of affordable homes for purchase, and acknowledging that renters are facing significant housing access and affordability challenges, the Government is committed to the introduction of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland. Cost Rental is housing where the rents are set at a level to cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only. This is different to private sector rentals where rents are set by the market, which may lead to high rents in high demand areas. A core objective of Cost Rental is to offer moderate income households the choice of a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure. Over the longer term, as homes are delivered at scale, it is envisaged that Cost Rental will have a stabilising effect on the broader private rental market.  Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, Cost Rental can make a sustainable impact on the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work. SSF funding is also available to local authorites to support the delivery of Cost Rental projects.</p><p>The Land Development Agency (LDA) also has a role in the delivery of more affordable housing and a minimum of 30% of housing on LDA sites must be affordable, with the balance contributing to additional new supply to meet the high levels of demand in the wider housing sector. This is consistent with a Government Decision in September 2018 that any State lands, in Ministerial ownership and deemed suitable for housing, being sold on the open market must deliver affordable housing on at least 30% of the site. </p><p>The suite of measures outlined above will mean that homes will be available to very many individuals and families on more moderate incomes who would otherwise not be in a position to own their own home. </p></reply>

Decisions with regard to the optimum work programme of the Valuation Office, including the selection, sequencing and grouping of rating authority areas for revaluation, are a matter for the independent Commissioner, taking into account the extensive valuation work required in each case and in terms of engaging with ratepayers and other stakeholders. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme. The objective of the programme is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 160 years is completed, as soon as possible, on a phased basis. </p>  <p>  Revaluation is a process whereby all rateable properties in a local authority area, rather than in a particular business sector, are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. The statutory provisions in the Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as changes in the business environment or infrastructural changes in the vicinity of a property. Each local authority area is a legal entity in its own right for the purposes of carrying out a revaluation. This requires the application of a separate valuation order and the publication of a new valuation list for each local authority area.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Act 2001, as amended by the Local Government Reform Act 2014, provides the legislative basis for the local authority budget process. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the total amount of rates to be levied by it in a particular year having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. The size or aggregate value of rateable properties on a valuation list does not determine the total amount of rates to be collected by a local authority and the sequencing of revaluations does not affect this process.</p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The revaluation reflects changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. The revaluation programme is not designed to benefit any particular business categories.</p>  <p>  Once the first revaluation of all areas is completed, the exercise must be repeated on a recurring basis, with revaluations required no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the previous revaluation. Where frequent revaluations occur on a rolling basis, this ensures equity and uniformity of the entire valuation system which underpins commercial rates. </p>  <p>  The Programme has already been completed in respect of the rating authority areas of Carlow, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, South Dublin and Westmeath County Councils and Dublin City Council, Waterford City and County Council and Limerick City and County Council. In keeping with the recurring nature of the Programme, a second revaluation of the South Dublin County Council rating authority area was also completed in 2017.</p>  <p>  The next phase of the programme, known as &ldquo;Reval 2019&rdquo;, commenced in late 2017 and concluded last year, with the revaluation of commercial and industrial properties in Cavan, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow County Councils. Fingal County Council also underwent a second revaluation having initially been the subject of a Revaluation in 2009. </p>  <p>  The latest phase, known as &ldquo;Reval 2021&rdquo;, commenced in late 2019 and will conclude in 2021 with the revaluation of commercial and industrial properties in Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry and Mayo County Councils and Galway City Council. </p>  <p>  The second revaluation of all rateable property in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown rating authority area was due to be finalised this year. However, as it is not possible to complete this exercise under current COVID-19 restrictions, it has recently been agreed with the Commissioner of Valuation that this revaluation will be deferred until next year, in line with the Reval 2021 timeline. An appropriate legislative amendment to underpin this decision will be brought forward at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020.</p>  <p>  The regulations came into operation on 31 January 2020, and my Department is currently in the process of finalising guidelines, which will be available in the coming weeks, to promote and support a consistent approach to the operation and administration of the defective concrete blocks grant scheme by Donegal and Mayo County Councils. The aim now is to commence the receipt of applications without delay.</p>  <p>  The defective concrete blocks grant scheme is primarily a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.  The scheme outlines five remedial options ranging from rebuilding on existing foundations to replacing of external walls. The maximum approved  costs per dwelling under the scheme range from &euro;55,000 to &euro;275,000, depending on the remedial option. A grant of 90% of the approved costs associated with the necessary remediation works, subject to a maximum for each remedial option, or 90% of the actual cost of the remedial works, whichever is the lesser, is available under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at assisting a specific group of homeowners who have no other practicable options to access redress. It is not a compensation scheme and the regulations apply only in respect of qualifying works that have not commenced prior to confirmation of grant approval being issued in respect of a dwelling by the relevant local authority. Homeowners cannot seek the recoupment of costs associated with the remediation of a dwelling undertaken either prior to the commencement, or outside, of the scheme. This is in line with how similar Government schemes operate or have operated in the past, where prior approval is a key eligibility requirement.</p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provides funding of &euro;40 million to fund the operation of the pyrite remediation scheme and the defective concrete blocks grant scheme this year.  Funding for future years will be agreed on an annual basis as part of the normal Estimates process.  Mindful that the scheme is being funded from the Exchequer, the scope of the scheme cannot be open ended. The funding available must be used prudently to achieve the most efficient and cost effective outcomes. </p>  <p>  The defective concrete blocks grant scheme only applies to private dwellings in Donegal and Mayo that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks. In respect of local authority housing stock, section 58 of the Housing Act 1966 provides that the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock is a matter for each individual local authority. This includes maintenance programmes and carrying out of responsive repairs and pre-letting repairs.  However, my Department is committed to supporting local authorities in terms of various targeted stock upgrade programmes, including issues arising in the context of defective concrete blocks, large-scale urban regeneration programmes, support for the return of vacant units to productive use, the Energy Retrofitting Programme and adaptations and extensions for people with disability in social housing. </p></reply>

In order for a borrower to qualify for the MTR scheme, the mortgage, property and household must meet detailed eligibility criteria.  In addition, the MTR process has to be carefully implemented with so many parties involved, including the homeowner, the lender, the relevant local authority and the Approved Housing Body or Private Company willing to acquire the property to enable the borrower to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.</p><p>I am not in a position to comment on any particular case nor would it be appropriate for me to do so.  I would, however, emphasise that as part of the normal administration of the scheme, the Housing Agency, who administer the scheme on my Department's behalf,  would need to ensure that all the criteria underpinning the scheme are complied with in each case.  The reasons why a case may not progress are varied and can depend on the lender, the property or the circumstances of the particular household.  </p><p>Should it transpire that MTR is not an option in a particular case, it will be a matter for the borrower to discuss with their lender if there are other options available to resolve their mortgage arrears situation.  </p><p>My focus, and that of the Government, is to ensure that as many households as possible remain in their homes and I would encourage borrowers to engage with the Abhaile Service, the national mortgage arrears resolution service, which is available free of charge to the borrower.  The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together, for the first time, the full range of supports and services required by borrowers in home mortgage arrears.  A dedicated adviser will work with the borrower and their lender to find the best solution for their particular situation. MABS acts as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning (076)1072000 or by accessing their website at: .  </p><p>For those borrowers in danger of losing their home who are ineligible for the MTR scheme but qualify for social housing support, it is recommended that they engage as early as possible with their local authority regarding their long-term housing needs.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no function in relation to decisions in this regard. </p>  <p>  Under the Valuation Act 2001, as amended, the Commissioner is responsible for the provision and maintenance of   a valuation list for each local authority area which is used by the local authority to determine the total amount of rates to be levied by it in a particular year. The provision and maintenance of valuation lists is accomplished using two statutory valuation processes known as &ldquo;revaluation&rdquo; and &ldquo;revision&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in the relative value of properties over time.</p>  <p>  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability across businesses more equitably. In essence, the exercise aims to ensure that each ratepayer bears a fair share of the business rates burden levied by their local authority, relative to the rental value of the property that they occupy. </p>  <p>  Revaluation is a process whereby all rateable properties in a local authority area are valued periodically by reference to a single valuation date. Revision, on the other hand, is intended to reflect structural changes to individual properties or the addition to the valuation lists of new properties between revaluations. This can reflect improvements to individual properties, subdivisions and amalgamations of properties, exemptions under Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended, and the removal of properties from the list when they are no longer capable of beneficial occupation.</p>  <p>  The restrictions on the operation of many businesses, the physical inaccessibility to business properties and the social distancing associated with controlling the COVID-19 pandemic have had an impact on the revision programme.  Accordingly, it is not possible to process revision applications at present; however, this will be kept under review in the context of the implementation of the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. </p>  <p>  Insofar as revaluation matters are concerned, the Valuation Office is currently engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure that the first revaluation of all rating authority areas in over 160 years is conducted across the country, as soon as possible, and on a phased basis. This is a welcome and positive development which is long overdue and on which considerable progress has been made in recent years. </p>  <p>  The current phase of the programme, known as Reval 2021, covers the rating authority areas of Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry and Mayo County Councils and Galway City Council. The new valuations for these local authority areas will be published in September 2021 and will come into effect for rating purposes from 2022 onwards. Ratepayers in these local authority areas are currently paying rates based on valuations which reflect economic conditions in 1988. </p>  <p>  For the majority of ratepayers, the outcome of a revaluation is very welcome. For example, across the 8 local authorities most recently revalued (Cavan, Fingal, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow County Councils), over 65% of ratepayers saw a reduction in their rates liability after revaluation. This is in line with the outcome of other revaluations conducted to date under the National Revaluation Programme. </p>  <p>  The second revaluation of all rateable property in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown rating authority area was due to be finalised this year. However, as it is not possible to complete this exercise under current COVID-19 restrictions, it has recently been agreed with the Commissioner of Valuation that this revaluation will be deferred until next year, in line with the Reval 2021 timeline. An appropriate legislative amendment to underpin this decision will be brought forward at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

This now provides the statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase in the State.</p><p>Under these provisions, I signed regulations in respect of the making of a Scheme of Priority on 12 March 2019, which in turn were issued to local authorities on 22 March 2019.  The purpose of a Scheme of Priority is to set out the affordable purchase arrangements at local authority level, and includes the methodology that will be applied by local authorities to determine the order of priority to be accorded to eligible households where the demand for such affordable dwellings exceeds the number available.  Dublin City Council members agreed the Council's Scheme of Priority in May 2019 and I approved the Scheme in early July 2019. Further affordable housing regulations will be put in place in the months ahead regarding eligibility and other matters.</p><p>The regeneration of Poolbeg West is the next logical step in transforming the Docklands area, given its strategic location east of Grand Canal Dock, with close proximity to important bridge connections to Dublin Port and North Lotts.  The extent of vacant available brownfield land in the area is significant, at 34 hectares. </p><p>The residential potential within the 34 hectare of available lands, is for a maximum of 3,500 additional residential units at a gross residential density of up to 238 units per hectare on lands over 14.7 hectares to the south of South Bank Road. This estimated housing yield would be sufficient to support a residential population of approximately 8,000 people and, therefore, would make a significant contribution to the city&rsquo;s housing needs. </p><p>During the process leading to the adoption of the planning scheme for the Poolbeg West area by the elected members of Dublin City Council, an issue of significant interest was the capacity of this site to assist both in the provision of much needed housing, but also that there would be an increased provision over the statutory 10% of housing units for social and affordable purposes.  This matter was considered both by Dublin City Council in the adoption of the planning scheme and by An Bord Pleanala in the consideration of appeals brought against the scheme adopted by the Council. In their decision of 9 April 2019, An Bord Pleanala modified the SDZ scheme in relation to this matter as follows:</p><p>- &ldquo;<i>Prior to commencement of development, subject to confirmed funding and value for money considerations, a commercial agreement shall be entered into between Dublin City Council, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the owners/developers of the residential element of the Planning Scheme for the delivery of 15% of the residential units approved on the lands included in this Planning Scheme for social and affordable housing purposes. These units shall be additional to the housing provided for social housing purposes as required above</i>. (i.e. additional to the 10% social and affordable)&rdquo; </p><p>In relation to the wider activation of these lands, it is understood that NAMA is currently undertaking a process to select a preferred bidder to develop the lands in the SDZ scheme area.  My Department remains committed to working with Dublin City Council, any relevant Approved Housing Bodies and either the receiver and/or developers of the SDZ area in order to secure additional social and affordable housing from this site over and above Part V obligations and of the order of magnitude laid out in the adopted planning scheme.  This will be subject to agreement on all the normal and relevant terms, including value for money aspects.</p><p>In order to support local authorities in their delivery of affordable homes, the Government has committed &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), which is to provide facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites so that more affordable homes, either to buy or rent, can be delivered.  At a maximum amount of &euro;50,000 per home, it is anticipated at least 6,200 more affordable homes can be provided. The SSF is being made available in areas where local authorities have demonstrated a requirement for affordable housing and the viability to deliver such housing on their sites.</p><p>Full details of the all projects approved under the 1st and 2nd SSF call for proposals are available at the following links: </p><p>, and . </p><p>It is intended to issue a 3rd call for proposals under the SSF to local authorities later this year.</p></reply>

Cost Rental is housing where rents are charged at a level to cover the cost of delivering, managing and maintaining the homes only. It is not designed to replace traditional social housing provision for low-income households, which remains a priority for the Government. Cost Rental is a new tenure option for Ireland, and is one of several schemes which my Department is pursuing to deliver on the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and ultimately provide more affordable housing.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council has estimated that the Emmet Road site can accommodate 484 homes in a high quality mixed-tenure development. It is envisaged that 375 of the homes will be Cost Rental, with the remaining homes reserved for social housing. Taken together with an adjacent development of integrated social housing for older people, the overall tenure mix for the area will be 30% social and 70% Cost Rental. Initial scoping suggests the Cost Rental and social housing units would both be a mixture of different apartment sizes as follows:</p>  <p>  - 72 studio apartments (all Cost Rental)</p>  <p>  - 128 one-bedroom apartments (108 Cost Rental, 20 social)</p>  <p>  - 210 two-bedroom apartments (177 Cost Rental, 33 social)</p>  <p>  - 74 three-bedroom apartments (18 Cost Rental, 56 social)</p>  <p>  A dedicated Dublin City Council (DCC) project manager and project team are in place to move the project forward, and a Development Framework Plan has been completed by architects on behalf of DCC. The Council is in the process of developing a Capital Works Management Framework application for the social housing element of the development, and will submit this to my Department. After undertaking a public procurement exercise in late 2019, DCC has just appointed an architect-led integrated design team.  This team will now work with the Council to bring forward a detailed design of the development and progress these plans through the planning stage.</p></reply>

Cost Rental is generally understood as being housing where the rents cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only, less any financial supports provided by the State or Local Authorities.  Depending on the nature of the model, Cost Rental lacks the level of profit margin often seen in the private rental sector and the rents are not overtly influenced by market supply and demand. With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, many households on more moderate incomes will have access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case. Cost Rental will be a new tenure option for Ireland, and is one of several schemes which my Department is pursuing in order to deliver on the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan and provide more affordable housing.</p>  <p>  The rents for Cost Rental units will naturally be a factor of the overall cost of each development and will vary according to the site and design specifics. My Department has identified a number of measures which can be used at the outset of a development in order put downward pressure on costs and make Cost Rental more affordable for tenants. These include provision of land at low/zero cost, a design approach with value engineering and long-term maintenance in mind, a potential State contribution to development costs via the Serviced Sites Fund, and the availability of low-cost, stable finance that is paid back over a long period of time.</p>  <p>  The Serviced Sites Fund provides &euro;310 million of support to help deliver more affordable homes. I can confirm that the SSF is available to local authorities to fund initial infrastructure works and so reduce the cost of building homes, which will be either sold under the Affordable Purchase scheme or made available under a Cost Rental scheme. Approved Housing Bodies will be able to access the benefits of SSF funding by working in partnership with Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  A number of Cost Rental 'pathfinder' pilots are currently under development that will act as examples of how Cost Rental can operate in practice. The first of these to commence construction is at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside. It consists of 50 Cost Rental homes alongside 105 social housing apartments. It is being developed by two Approved Housing Bodies, Tuath and Respond, in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and the Housing Agency. Construction began in July 2019 and delivery is currently scheduled for 2021.</p>  <p>  This project at Enniskerry Road is being is supported through both the mechanisms suggested by the Deputy, namely long-term, low-interest loan financing from the Housing Finance Agency, to be repaid over 40 years, as well as upfront capital assistance from my Department through an investment of some &euro;5 million of SSF funding. My Department is aware of the positive impact that these supports can have on reducing the cost of development and the ultimate rent paid by the tenants, which at Enniskerry Road is projected to be &euro;1,200 for a two-bedroom apartment.</p>  <p>  More generally, the terms of any financing mechanism used in the delivery of a Cost Rental development would obviously be a matter for agreement between the parties involved in each specific case.  However, I can confirm that there is a clear understanding of the fundamental need for long term financing to support the delivery of the Cost Rental model and engagement with funders such as the EIB, who have signalled broad support in this area, are undertaken in that context.</p></reply>

A maximum SSF funding amount of &euro;50,000 is available per home.  This sum is comprised of &euro;44,500 (or 89%) Exchequer contribution and a &euro;5,500 (or 11%) local authority contribution.  On this basis, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated by this measure alone.  This funding is being made available in areas where local authorities have demonstrated a requirement for more affordable housing and the viability to deliver such housing from their sites.</p><p>To date, through 2 Calls for Proposals issued to local authorities, I have allocated SSF funding of &euro;127 million in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas.

The Authority noted that the results of the trials did not produce a clear recommendation for a secure voting method that is likely to meet the needs of most voters with sight loss. However, the Authority recommended that ballot paper templates (BPTs) be trialled at a future referendum where voters have a simple &lsquo;yes/no&rsquo; choice, and that the results be monitored and evaluated.</p>  <p>  Good progress has been made in recent years to enable visually impaired voters to vote in secret. BPTs have been brought into use to enable people with a visual impairment to vote in secret, removing the need for a companion or the presiding officer to assist them. BPTs were used successfully for the first time at the referendum held in May 2018.  The rollout of the BPT was continued at the Presidential election held in October 2018, the European Parliament and local elections held in May 2019 and the General Election held in February 2020.  A BPT is attached to a ballot paper and it consists of raised numbering and corresponding braille to assist the voter in identifying the openings on the template that correspond to the voter preference boxes for the candidates on the ballot paper. It  operates in conjunction with a &lsquo;freephone 1800&rsquo; number. Based on the interaction between the tactile features of the template and the information provided on the &lsquo;freephone&rsquo; number, the voter can mark the ballot paper with their voting preferences (1, 2, 3 etc.). The candidate information on the &lsquo;freephone&rsquo; number can be accessed as often as required in advance of polling day and again on polling day at the polling station with a mobile phone, if required. Another option open to voters with the relevant screen reading technology (e.g. on their phones, tablets or laptops) is to familiarise themselves with the candidates in a particular constituency or local electoral area by accessing the relevant &lsquo;Notice of Poll&rsquo; or &lsquo;candidate details&rsquo; section on the relevant website. </p>  <p>  In December 2018, I established a Working Group on Voting Accessibility which includes representation from the National Disability Authority, the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the National Council for the Blind and the Blind Legal Alliance. The Working Group is examining feedback on the use of the BPTs at recent electoral events and this is assisting in the development of improvements for people who may wish to use the BPT when voting.</p>  <p>  While electoral law is kept under review, I have no plans at present to amend the law to provide for voting by telephone or electronic means.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation has responsibility for valuation matters, including determination of relevant property under the Acts for the purposes of rates. As Minister, I have no function in relation to decisions in this regard.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Acts provide that certain categories of properties are not rateable.  Details of these properties are set out in Schedule 4 of the Acts and include a property occupied by a charity exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit.  This exemption would not include retail activity.  </p>  <p>  The Acts are quite specific about the range of exemptions that can be allowed by the Commissioner of Valuation, who has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4.  As a matter of course, the Valuation Office examines all cases on their individual merits by reference to the relevant statutory provisions governing the valuation process as they relate to categories of properties.   </p>  <p>  Local authorities may decide to offer assistance or money in kind, as provided for under section 66 of the Local Government Act 2001, in order to promote the interests of the local community, which includes, inter alia, the economic or general development of the administrative area (or part of it) of the local authority concerned.  Also, local authorities work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulty in the payment of commercial rates.  In this regard, local authorities facilitate the payment of commercial rates by instalments, and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options that reflect capacity to pay.</p>  <p>  Additionally, and of relevance to retail outlets, on 2 May 2020, Government announced that a waiver of commercial rates will apply to all businesses that have been forced to close due to COVID-19 related public health requirements, from 27 March 2020, for a three-month period. The expected costs of &euro;260m will be met by the Exchequer. </p></reply>

During this period, approximately 2.5 million registered land parcels, comprising approximately 15 million line entities, were digitised from 36,000 PRA paper map sheets. </p>  <p>  The project involved much more than transferring registered land parcels from a paper map record to a digital map record, particularly having regard to the many factors that contributed to the complexity of the project, such as:</p>  <p>  - moving all registrations from the now defunct County Series and Irish Grid map projections to the latest Irish Transverse Mercator map projection;</p>  <p>  - variances between the development schemes mapped on the PRA paper-based record and the more accurate &lsquo;as built&rsquo; layout presented by Ordnance Survey Ireland;</p>  <p>  - transferring registrations from Western seaboard counties, which were predominantly mapped on 1/10560 or 6&rdquo; Ordnance Survey mapping, which had not benefited from any revisions for decades;</p>  <p>  - deciphering map data on old PRA paper maps, some of which were 100 years old; and</p>  <p>  - deciphering map data on badly damaged PRA paper maps.</p>  <p>  Prior to the data capture element of the project, the process was validated by eminent international mapping and land administration experts.</p>  <p>  Having completed the project, a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the data capture was carried out.  This study revealed an error rate of just 0.18 per cent.  I understand that it is the PRA&rsquo;s view that this error rate is well within the acceptable range, given the complexity of the project.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am assured by the PRA that it has in place robust procedures whereby the registered owners of properties or their representatives can engage with the PRA in relation to matters pertaining to the mapped representation of the registration.  The PRA also has a longstanding and valued relationship with solicitors, surveyors, engineers and architects in all matters pertaining to property registration.</p>  <p>  The PRA&rsquo;s experience has been such that many of the queries received, once investigated, do not indicate any registration error.  Many of the perceived errors do not emanate from the PRA but, in fact, originate from inaccuracies in the application map lodged for registration.  Responsibility for the accuracy of the application map lodged rests with the applicant.</p>  <p>  In addition, the PRA digital mapping project resolved many thousands of pre-existing issues and anomalies that existed in the paper-based map system. Being proactive in the adoption of Ordnance Survey Ireland topographical detail during digitisation has absolved many property owners of the need to incur costs in an effort to perfect or amend the Land Register to reflect the actual position on the ground.</p>  <p>  Finally, registrations that are queried involve the retrieval of the original registration documents and maps in order to facilitate a thorough analysis and examination.  On some occasions, there is a necessity to revert to and consult with Irish Land Commission maps and documentation in order to draw a conclusion.  Approximately 50 per cent of the cases reviewed by the PRA result in no change to the registration.  Notwithstanding this, the PRA makes every effort to review each case in as timely a manner as possible.</p></reply>

The registration of such rights is a matter for the Property Registration Authority of Ireland (PRAI) and those wishing to register their rights should engage directly with the PRAI. In the context of the potential interaction between existing rights and foreshore licence applications to harvest wild seaweed, my Department has engaged on a number of occasions with the PRAI to ensure a common understanding of the issues involved. </p>  <p>  All foreshore licence applicants are required to engage in a pre-application consultation with my Department. At that stage, the requirements around public consultation and all other aspects of the application process are explained.  In addition, applicants in the course of their application, have ongoing contact with my Department, through which clarification is provided on any issues arising in relation to  searches for formal and informal rights.  </p>  <p>  Following clarification of the legal position, all applicants have been made aware of my Department&rsquo;s position on the interaction between existing rights and foreshore licence applications to hand harvest seaweed. Applicants are required to engage in a very thorough process of researching where existing rights to harvest seaweed might exist. </p>  <p>  No licence applications to harvest wild seaweed have been determined by my Department in the last five years.  All applications for foreshore leases or licences including those to harvest wild seaweed, when deemed complete, are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  During the consultation on the National Marine Planning Framework that concluded recently, it was suggested that a forum on seaweed be established and I will consider this suggestion. Currently, my responsibilities regarding seaweed are limited to the provisions of the 1933 Foreshore Act that do not include either the promotion or economic development of the sector. </p>  <p>  As I outlined during a debate on Sustainable Seaweed Harvesting during Dail Private Members' time on 7 March 2018, any regulatory regime cannot focus solely on the sector from one viewpoint. We must take into account the interests of a multiplicity of stakeholders, balancing the existing rights of traditional harvesters with commercial potential, while also ensuring sustainability of the resource and compliance with the State's obligations under domestic and EU environmental law.</p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the biomass of the wild seaweed resource, funding was secured under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) for two seaweed related projects. The first project is focused on seaweed biomass assessments and the other on the socio economic importance of seaweed. The Marine Institute are presently finalising the terms of reference of both projects.</p></reply>

The draft NMPF is Ireland&rsquo;s first comprehensive marine spatial plan document and outlines the clear structure and direction proposed for the development, conservation and enjoyment of our maritime area. This important new text will, when finalised, stand as the marine equivalent of the terrestrial National Planning Framework and will become the key decision-making tool for regulatory authorities and policy makers into the future.</p><p>The NMPF is the product of extensive work across Government and significant engagement and interaction with all marine stakeholders over a 2-year period.</p><p>The Draft NMPF, as well as other associated reports, is available for viewing on my Department's website via the following link: .</p><p>Public consultation on the draft NMPF commenced on 12 November 2019 and the closing date was extended to 30 April 2020.  Environmental Reports, including the Strategic Environmental Assessment Screening Determination, Strategic Environmental Assessment, Appropriate Assessment and Natura Impact Statement, were prepared and made available as part of this consultation. </p><p>In keeping with the focus on public engagement which I outlined at the launch of the draft NMPF, my Department has convened a number of regional workshops as part of the consultation, with each regional workshop focusing on marine themes appropriate or significant to their respective locations. </p><p>In light of the restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus), my Department organised a Public 'webinar' to facilitate a further consultation opportunity during this period. This webinar was held on 21 April 2020.</p><p>As stated above, the consultation closed on 30 April 2020, and my Department is now evaluating all submissions received. The draft NMPF and associated environmental reports will be amended as required, based on the results of the evaluation of feedback received. The final NMPF and associated environmental reports will be prepared for submission to Government and presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas during Q4 2020. The final NMPF must be submitted to the European Commission by end-March 2021.</p></reply>

It is important, therefore, that the efforts and resources of the local authorities are focused more significantly on their construction programmes and that they continue to use acquisitions in line with the above approach.  In both 2018 and 2019, the targets for acquisitions of social housing in Galway City have been exceeded. </p>  <p>  No directive has issued to Galway City Council to only purchase one-bedroom properties for social housing.  As part of supporting the Council&rsquo;s work to respond to homelessness, particularly through the Housing First programme, the need to target one-bedroom properties for that programme has been discussed by my Department with both Galway authorities and at the Galway Housing Task Force. My Department has also discussed with all local authorities a need to focus acquisitions on other priority situations where, for example, there may be tenants with particular needs, or targeting derelict properties.  Also, acquisitions may arise as part of the strategic delivery of social housing in areas of need, where there may be no other scope for delivery due to, for example, lack of sites or infrastructure issues.  Local authorities can also refer suitable acquisition opportunities to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for consideration as part of their programmes.</p>  <p>  In locations where, for example, a new build approach is not possible for social housing delivery, local authorities are encouraged to acquire and refurbish properties that may be derelict or in need of upgrade. Funding is available under initiatives such as 'Repair &amp;amp; Lease' and 'Buy &amp;amp; Renew' to support such work.</p></reply>

Data in respect of the broader housing stock, for example with support from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  The local authority social housing retrofitting programme improves the insulation standards and overall energy performance of local authority housing stock, which can benefit those at risk of fuel poverty, as well as contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction and energy efficiency targets.  Since the beginning of the programme, over &euro;151 million of exchequer support has been provided for this work, which has improved the energy efficiency and comfort levels in over 72,000 local authority homes. </p>  <p>  For 2020, the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting programme for social housing has an allocated exchequer budget of &euro;25 million, while a further &euro;20 million is being made available for similar retrofitting in the midlands as part of the 'Just Transition' programme. </p>  <p>  The cost of carrying out an energy retrofit on a social housing home depends on a wide range of factors including dwelling size, year of construction, dwelling condition and construction type.

Detailed statistics in relation to social housing delivery are published on a quarterly basis and the most recent data, up to Q3 2019, are  available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p><i>. </i></p><p>Data to end 2019 is currently being finalised and will be published shortly.</p><p>It is very important to focus resources, funding and attention to where it is most needed.  Local authorities are the competent authorities for delivering homes for people living in their functional areas and my Department supports them in this work. Connecting targets to established need is a key element of this work. Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority area are set out in the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA), which has been carried out annually since 2016. The purpose of the SSHA is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need is not being met, in order to better inform policy and plan for the delivery of the right types of housing support. The data garnered through the Summary allows the Department to target the delivery of social housing supports under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to those most in need.</p><p>The most recently conducted SSHA details the number of households on all local authority waiting lists as at 24 June 2019 (the count date) and shows that 68,693 households were assessed as qualified and being in need of social housing support. This represents a decrease of 3,165 households or 4.4% on the previous assessment in June 2018. Indeed, since the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan was launched in 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 68,693, a reduction of 25%. </p><p>The SSHA provides local authorities with information about current demand for social housing. It is also important that local authorities are aware of, and planning for, the potential future demand for social housing when they are preparing their Housing Strategies as part of their Development Plan process. To this end, National Policy Objective 37 of the National Planning Framework requires that each local authority should undertake a &quot;Housing Need and Demand Assessment&quot; for their area. This will be important in estimating likely future housing need across tenures, including social housing need.</p><p>Work on the development of the HNDA process is ongoing in my Department. Research on population projections at county level is being progressed with the ESRI and development of a HNDA tool with the Scottish Centre for Housing Market Analysis is also in train. This new evidence-based approach will form the basis of a more accurate and consistent projection of demand for different tenures of housing.</p><p>My Department continues to provide additional resources and explore new opportunities and innovations to increase supply.  Technical resources, which during the inactive years had been lost to local authorities, continue to be replenished. Streamlined approval processes for capital projects have been put in place, including a revised single stage approval process. A range of supports have also been put in place including:</p><p>- Internal Layouts for Social Housing;</p><p>- Employers Requirements;</p><p>- Volumetric Frameworks;</p><p>- Rapid Build Framework;</p><p>- Guidance Notes, including on Turnkey Delivery;</p><p>- Planning Reforms;</p><p>- Heights &amp;amp; Apartment Guidelines;</p><p>- A newly restructured Housing Delivery Coordination Office has been established within the LGMA to further strengthen the collaborative work between local authorities and my Department.</p></reply>

Project Ireland 2040 restates the commitment to implement statutory planning guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas, published by my Department in 2009.</p><p>The Guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areasare specifically referred to in SPPR 4 of the Urban and Building Height Guidelines, published in December 2018.It should be noted that SPPR 4 sets out a specific planning policy requirement in relation to the development of greenfield, or edge of city/town locations, for housing purposes, particularly in relation to appropriate building height, that Planning Authorities are required to follow.</p><p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la is a statutory independent body and it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment in relation to individual decisions it makes.  However, in general, it should be noted that An Bord Plean&aacute;la typically upholds national policy where there is divergence apparent in local policy.</p><p>The Guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areasgenerally require densities in the range of 35-50 dwellings per hectare (dph) on outer suburban/greenfield sites.  This has been established Government policy for a significant period of time, dating back to 1999.  The Guidelines, however, also provide scope for densities below 35 dph on more peripheral sites in smaller towns and villages, in particular to assist in delivering more sustainable alternatives to dispersed urban-generated rural houses.</p><p>Given that individual county development plans prioritise key towns, including county towns and many larger towns, for future development with significant population growth targets, achieving densities of 35 dph and over is important. Not achieving such densities means that such towns will become even more spread out and car dependent, with negative implications for tackling climate change and for promoting and sustaining public transport systems or even for the provision of cycling and walking networks.</p><p>Moreover, achieving densities of at least 35 dph is essential in catering for the more diverse range of smaller households presenting today, including couples who may wish to downsize, creating the flexibility for households to stay in their neighbourhoods/towns as their housing requirements change. Such densities are achievable through a mix of some individual homes, coupled with a significant level of semi-detached and some terraced housing.</p><p>In terms of research, the Guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areasarea were issued together with a detailed manual and include a list of relevant documents at Appendix B, available at the following link:</p><p>It should also be noted that the 1999 Guidelines on Residential Density for Planning Authorities were based on a detailed research report undertaken by Feargal McCabe Town Planning Consultants and McCrosson O&rsquo;Rourke Architects.</p><p>I am satisfied that the 2009 Guidelines are entirely consistent with supporting the appropriate development of our towns and urban centres in the context of the compact urban growth objective of the NPF.</p></reply>

The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is then processed by the HAP SSC. Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities and the HAP SSC continue to provide a critical service to all HAP customers. While local authorities are putting in place arrangements to reduce direct contact, because of public health requirements, alternative processes are in place to ensure a HAP service continues to be provided.  This is particularly important for those applying for support under Homeless HAP in the current crisis.</p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, priority is currently being given to HAP set-ups and ensuring that landlords are paid and that HAP tenancies are maintained.  HAP applications continue to be received and processed by local authorities, and the HAP Shared Service Centre is continuing to carry out all of the necessary back office activities in setting up HAP tenancies as normal.</p>  <p>  HAP application processing times within local authorities may vary. Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant local authority, it is entered on the system by the local authority and then submitted for processing and payment by the HAP SSC.  If there are delays at the processing stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord will be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority.   The landlord is therefore not penalised for any delay. </p>  <p>  As at 11 May 2020, a weekly average of 293 HAP tenancies have been set up in 2020, with the most recent 5 week trend data showing a weekly average of 326 tenancies being signed-up.  Since 2 March 2020, 2,947 HAP tenancies have been set up, including 456 Homeless HAP tenancies in the DRHE region. Over 76,600 HAP tenancies have been set-up since the Scheme commenced, over 55,300 of which are still active.</p>  <p>  Under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020, the Government introduced additional supports and protections for renters, beyond the income supports already agreed with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The Act provides for amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2019, which will operate for a period of 3 months from 27 March 2020. Provision has also been made for this period to be extended, if the Government considers it appropriate to do so.  </p>  <p>  A notice of termination cannot be served during the COVID&ndash;19 emergency period.  All notices of termination which were served before the emergency period are paused and tenants, in general, cannot be obliged to leave their rented accommodation during this time.  Similarly, all notices of rent increase which were served before the emergency period and were due to take effect during this period, are paused. While tenants are obliged to pay rent during the COVID &ndash; 19 emergency period, landlords are not permitted to increase the amount of rent payable during this period.</p>  <p>  Under HAP, a tenant sources his or her own accommodation in the private rented market. The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 -2019. HAP supported tenancies are afforded the same protections available to all private rented tenancies.  </p></reply>

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the Scheme provide for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living. </p>  <p>  Part V homes are among the classes excluded from the tenant purchase scheme - this is to ensure that homes delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support, and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time. The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed-tenure, sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  Local authorities may, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management. It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the Scheme in its operational area in line with the over-arching provisions of the governing legislation, and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements. </p>  <p>  The 2016 Scheme does not extend to houses owned by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) as the ownership of these properties remains with the AHB concerned. Under the terms of the various funding schemes supporting the delivery of social housing by AHBs, AHBs are the legal owners of the properties and must make them available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement. </p>  <p>  In line with the commitment given in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, a review of the operation of the first 12 months of the Tenant Purchase (Incremental) Scheme has been finalised and a full report has been prepared setting out findings and recommendations. </p>  <p>  This issue is part of a significant body of work undertaken in my Department in relation to the broader social housing reform agenda.

Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure that immediate risks are addressed and that a plan is put in place, where required, for works to bring buildings into compliance. </p><p>In relation to legacy issues generally, I acknowledge the very stressful circumstances which owners and residents face when defects occur in their homes.  However, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, that is the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. The State has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters. It is not possible for the State to take on responsibility/liability for all legacy issues nor would it send the right message to the industry regarding their responsibility for compliance.</p><p>My focus will remain firmly on ensuring the full roll out of the building control reform agenda, to ensure that all those that engaged in the construction sector take their responsibilities seriously and are appropriately held to account.  As part of the reform agenda, consumer protection will continue to be my core concern and any proposals in that regard will, of course, be considered.</p></reply>

Some local authorities have used this funding to set up specific local grant schemes or supported specific projects.  </p><p>The main source of funding for local community events and activities under the Creative Ireland Programme is <i>Creative Communities</i>.  In 2019, total funding of &euro;3m was allocated to all 31 local authorities (approximately &euro;96,000 each) to enable them to support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in the county.  Each local authority has established a Creative Ireland Co-coordinator and a local Culture Team to manage and allocate this funding in accordance with local needs and in line with their own, individual 5-year Culture and Creativity Strategy. Nearly 1,500 projects were funded nationwide in 2019 covering a broad range of topics including archaeology, architecture, biodiversity, crafts, heritage, drama, dance, literature, music, storytelling and the visual arts.</p></reply>

While it is unlawful to be in possession of, or to use, a detection device on any monument site protected under those Acts without Ministerial consent under section 2 of the 1987 National Monuments (Amendment) Act, such consent is only otherwise needed where the device is being used for the express purpose of searching for archaeological objects.  </p>  <p>  I do want to emphasise, however, that unregulated and inappropriate use of metal detectors causes serious and irreparable damage to Ireland&rsquo;s archaeological heritage.  Unsupervised recovery of archaeological objects can greatly diminish, and could entirely eliminate, any research value that might be gained from a particular discovery.  Archaeological objects must be excavated in a structured scientific manner, with careful recording of their association with other objects, structures, features and soil layers.</p>  <p>  I believe that the Deputy would support me in wanting to retain a system where important cultural heritage material is subject to an appropriate protection regime, that archaeological objects found in the State belong to the people and are not liable to fall into private ownership, and that he would back the current statutory safeguards rather than seeking to introduce changes that would be inappropriate to the circumstances as they exist in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I consider the present legislative framework, and the manner in which it is implemented, to be reasonable, proportionate and essential to preventing irreparable loss and damage to our national heritage. Therefore, I have no proposals at present to make any changes to the law as it applies to the use of metal detecting devices. However, my Department is in contact with the organisation referred to by the Deputy and will be responding to any proposals they have put forward.</p></reply>

Shorelines absorb and attenuate the energy entering the coastal zone, thereby acting as natural coastal defences. Material that is eroded from one section of the coast accumulates in another, such that the contours of the coastline are constantly in a state of change. Coastal habitats and species protected by special areas of conservation are adapted to survive and depend upon these unstable conditions.  </p>  <p>  Because coastal habitats and species are dependent on natural erosion and accretion, they can be damaged either directly or indirectly when coastal protection structures are put in place.  Furthermore, interference with natural, dynamic coastal processes (by trying to slow down or stop them) can sometimes invite further instability and increased rates of damage to land and property in the area concerned. The construction of physical barriers such as sea defences can interrupt longshore drift, leading to beach starvation and increased rates of erosion in adjacent areas.  Therefore, care must be taken to consider fully the effects of any response to erosional events. </p>  <p>  Implementation of coastal defences through engineering is not part of my Department&rsquo;s remit. Natural erosion rates can be increased by human impacts such as climate change and recreation, and these factors should be taken into account when considering an appropriate response. My Department will continue to provide advice to local authorities in this matter as appropriate.</p></reply>

The full financial and economic implications of the crisis are not yet known, as further information continues to come to hand and having regard to the fact that the impact on the sectors supported by the Department could extend well past the lifting of any COVID-19 restrictions.  </p><p>Since the advent of the crisis, officials from my Department have been actively engaging with the arts sector and have met and continue to meet with arts and cultural organisations under its aegis, as well a broad range of sectorial stakeholders including resource organisations, advocacy groups as well as individual artists and arts practices</p><p>In the context of the wider cultural sector, officials of my Department have met and continues to meet with the State Bodies under its aegis.  The  Department is continuing to work with the Arts Council and Screen Ireland as well as other parts of Government, to assess and measure the effects of COVID-19 on the cultural sector and continue to plan how best to manage through this crisis.  A number of measures have been taken to date to support this sector by the Department and its agencies.</p><p>My Department and the Arts Council are providing detailed advice for arts and arts organisations on their websites.  Priority is being given towards supporting the artists and arts workers.</p><p>The Arts Council responded quickly to the impact of COVID-19 on the arts sector. At the start of the COVID-19 emergency, the Council introduced a series of measures to help artists and arts organisations manage their businesses during the period of the COVID-19 crisis.  These can be accessed on its website at the following link: </p><p>These measures include honouring all existing funding commitments and asking regularly funded arts organisation to prioritise their own payments to artists in turn. Since March 12th the Arts Council has fast-tracked the payment of up to 90% of funding to organisations and individuals. </p><p>The Arts Council has announced that there will be no financial penalties for arts organisations and individuals unable to deliver programmed events and activities arising from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>The Arts Council is in daily contact with a broad range of artists and organisations to understand how COVID-19 is impacting the sector. The Council continues to operate fully throughout the COVID-19 crisis to support artists and arts organisations through this difficult time. Regular updates are being provided on its website and its social media channels.</p><p>The Council has also undertaken detailed surveys of arts organisations to get a deep understanding of how COVID-19 is impacting the arts sector. This is helping to identify the impact on audiences, employment and finances for March, April and May as well as a survey of artists seeking information of the economic impact on individuals. .</p><p>With regards to Culture Ireland, a new grant scheme was announced in early April, to support professional artists and enable the live presentation of their work on online platforms for an initial period of 4 weeks. Funding of &euro;100,000 has being made available on a match funded basis by FACEBOOK Ireland and Culture Ireland, a division of the Department. All successful artists have been awarded &euro;1,000. The scheme is being managed by Culture Ireland in conjunction with First Music Contact and Poetry Ireland.</p><p>Full details are available at <i>www.cultureireland.gov.ie</i>. </p><p>My Department will continue to engage with the agencies under its remit and other sectorial stakeholders to ensure that there is the greatest level of awareness of the supports that are available, and to ensure that optimal use is made of available resources to best support the sector at this challenging time.</p><p>During this emergency period the first phase of recovery has been the introduction of exceptional measures such as the pandemic payment and the wage subsidy schemes. My colleague Minister Doherty recently announced that over a million people across several sectors are now receiving some sort of state income support which is unprecedented in this nation&rsquo;s history. These are divided between the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUPs), those on the Live Register and workers who are benefiting from the Wage Subsidy Scheme.</p><p>I look forward to working with my colleagues across government on the type of measures that will be needed to allow the economy recover and to see sectors such as the arts and cultural sector play a full role in the recovery phase.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also represented on these groups and lead any criminal investigations.  The groups are convened by the Fire Services Department of the relevant Local Authority and the Chief Fire Officer for the Local Authority. Generally, the Chief Fire Officer for the Local Authority would chair the meetings and maintain records and the membership of such groups would include representation from stakeholders such as:</p><p>- Fire Services Department of the Local Authority</p><p>- Garda&iacute;</p><p>- Forest Service Section of the Department of Agriculture and Food</p><p>- NPWS</p><p>- Coillte</p><p>- Teagasc</p><p>The primary responsibility in terms of fire fighting lies with the Fire Service and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. </p><p>My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as appropriate, to investigate the causes of such fires on designated sites and in national parks and, where evidence is forthcoming, to pursue appropriate enforcement under the Wildlife Acts or other legislation.  The prosecution of those responsible is primarily a matter for the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Department, through its National Parks and Wildlife Service staff, cooperates fully with any Garda investigations and any other investigations that may be initiated by other statutory bodies.  Where appropriate, this Department pursues cross compliance with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>
