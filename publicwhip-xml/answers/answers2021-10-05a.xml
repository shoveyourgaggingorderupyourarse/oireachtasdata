    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-05a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100500055#WRA00600"><p>While the aviation sector is of critical importance in terms of the recovery of our tourism sector, the responsibility for aviation, including the temporary closure of Cork Airport,  falls to my colleague, the Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan.</p>  <p>  While I hope that 2022 will see a strong rebound in overall tourism, it seems likely that overseas visitor numbers will be significantly down on 2019 so maximising the domestic tourism market over the next few years is vital as we encourage tourism businesses to re-open, re-hire staff and rebuild their businesses.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s domestic marketing campaign, &lsquo;Keep Discovering&rsquo;, which promotes all parts of Ireland including Cork, is about encouraging people to discover our wonderful country again now that restrictions are lifted.  The economic importance of a domestic holiday cannot be overstated, particularly now at this point in our country&rsquo;s recovery, so it&rsquo;s about turning plans into bookings. </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to work to further develop tourism in Cork in both the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East regional brand areas, and is involved in a wide variety of activity in both of these regional brand areas. The agency also partners with Cork Airport to ensure that the sense of place in the airport is delivered to every passenger by driving awareness of the experience brands in the region.</p>  <p>  Cork also features on F&aacute;ilte Ireland's new look DiscoverIreland.ie website for domestic visitors.  The website has been redesigned as a one-stop shop for domestic visitors, showcasing the wealth of things to see and do across Ireland. </p>  <p>  Promoting the island of Ireland in the aftermath of COVID-19 requires a new tactical &lsquo;book now&rsquo; campaign delivered at scale across markets. I  travelled to America recently to help Tourism Ireland launch its new tourism promotional "Green Button" campaign to get Americans to visit Ireland sometime soon. The &lsquo;Green Button&rsquo; campaign will be deployed to encourage maximum visitor booking at the most opportune time and creating a commitment to travel .</p>  <p>  The campaign will be highly visible utilising multiple consumer channels such as TV and digital platforms. Iconic attractions from both the Republic and Northern Ireland will be front and centre and the ultimate goal will be for large numbers in our target markets to "press the green button" and travel to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  I also travelled to London recently to engage with key tourism industry stakeholders there and in particular the global inbound tour operators about opportunities to rebuild tourism business to Ireland.</p></reply>

I recognise the essential role that the local media plays and the particular value of local and regional newspapers and radio stations, including community radio, in sharing reliable and relevant local news and bringing communities together.</p>  <p>  The Future of Media Commission was tasked with bringing forward recommendations to put media on a sustainable footing over the next decade. It has engaged comprehensively with stakeholders, including local media.  The Taoiseach and I have received the Report and are currently considering its contents and the Report will be brought to Government for consideration in due course.  </p>  <p>  In terms of supports for the local print sector, I understand that at least &euro;4.4 million was spent by Government on regional and local print advertising from March 2020 to April 2021.  Recently, my Department's campaign for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g included a spend of &euro;187,000 on local print advertising.</p>  <p>  In relation to the local radio sector, I allocated &euro;4.9m in additional funding to the Sound and Vision Scheme administered by the BAI in December 2020.   This enabled a specific round of &euro;2.48m  for the independent and local radio sector which was distributed in April 2021.   This funding, which is Round 39 of the Sound and Vision 4 scheme, was in addition to a similar funding round of Sound and Vision that took place in 2020, together with a waiver of the broadcasting levy for the first half of the year, which was worth &euro;1m to the sector. </p>  <p>  Moreover, Government COVID-related advertising spend provided an additional &euro;1.8m to the sector in Q1 2021 and 17 radio stations availed of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) receiving a total of &euro;1.5m in Q1 of this year.  </p>  <p>  The BAI will continue to report to me on the financial status of the sector in the coming months.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-05a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100500055#WRA01400"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising the status of this vital piece of legislation. The enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is a Programme for Government commitment. It will establish a regulatory framework for online safety overseen by an Online Safety Commissioner as part of a wider multi-person Media Commission. The Bill will update the regulatory frameworks for television broadcasting and video on-demand services. It will also dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and transpose the European Union&rsquo;s revised &lsquo;Audiovisual Media Service Directive&rsquo; into Irish law.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill was approved by Government on the 9th January 2020. On the 8th December 2020, the Government approved the finalisation of the General Scheme through the addition of further provisions. On 18th May 2021, the Government approved the integration of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill into the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. </p>  <p>  Given the importance of this legislation, I asked the Government to approve the commencement of detailed drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Attorney General and the referral of the General Scheme the Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny simultaneously. This detailed drafting process is now nearing completion and will be finalised once the pre-legislative scrutiny report has been received and analysed. </p>  <p>  Pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media is on-going. It included oral hearings from May to July with contributions from regulators, industry, NGOS, and other affected stakeholders. I would like to acknowledge the extensive work of the Joint Oireachtas Committee in this regard and I await the publication of their pre-legislative scrutiny report. Once this has been received and there has been an assessment of its recommendations,  the Bill will be brought forward for publication and enactment.</p>  <p>  There is significant urgency attached to the enactment of the Bill, not least due to ongoing infringement proceedings against Ireland given the implementation deadline of 19 September 2020 for the revised Directive. These proceedings have recently moved to the &ldquo;reasoned opinion&rdquo; stage and the European Commission has noted the potential imposition of significant fines for continued non-transposition. </p>  <p>  This underlines the absolute necessity of progressing the Bill to enactment and providing for the establishment of the Media Commission, including an Online Safety Commissioner, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The purpose of this scheme is to assist in putting items from the National Collections on display to the public on a greater and wider basis. In particular the scheme facilitates the display of pieces and exhibitions from the National Collections with specific local and regional interest direct to those communities. </p><p>The Scheme is designed to fund the transport, cost of insurance and exhibiting costs for pieces from the National Collections to appropriate institutions around the country. </p><p>Some recent examples of activities supported by the scheme include:</p><p>- Waterford Museum of Treasures in the Viking Triangle took loan of an eight-branch chandelier dating to 1790 and originally made in Waterford. The loan was facilitated by the National Museum of Ireland.</p><p>- M&uacute;seam Chorca Dhuibhne has borrowed from the National Museum of Ireland and will be displaying a gold medieval ring brooch which was originally found locally near Dingle in 2015 </p><p>- The Hunt Museum held a substantial exhibition of 32 works borrowed from the Crawford Art Gallery's Great Southern Art Collection. The exhibition ran from June to September and was called Signals of Change 20th Century Irish Arts Great Southern Collection.</p><p>In addition to this scheme the National Cultural Institutions are committed to increasing access to the national collections through online exhibitions and by lending objects to local exhibitions.  While the NCIs under the aegis of my Department are independent in their management of day-to-day matters, the loaning and dissemination of items from the National Collection under their care is actively encouraged.</p><p>During the pandemic, the NCIs demonstrated great innovation by sharing the national collections online. For example the IMMA Online programme has made thousands of artworks available to audiences around the country through the digitisation of its collection. With &ldquo;Talking Art Online&rdquo;, the museum hosts regular talks on the collection with community groups. These are offered to Broadband Connection points in rural areas through the Department of Rural and Community Affairs and IMMA has delivered 7 sessions to date from Achill Island to Carlow.  </p><p>My Department will continue to encourage and provide support for the showcasing of objects from the national collections in rural communities. </p><p>">Table</p></reply>

There have been five phases of the Scheme to date, which ran from February to September this year. The various phases of the Scheme provided a direct financial contribution to support business continuity plans and contribute towards fixed costs. </p>  <p>  Phase One supported businesses that were ineligible to receive the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) such as outdoor tourism activity providers, tourism golf courses, hop-on hop-off tourism bus tour operators, cruise hire companies, tourism boat tour operators, visitor attractions, and caravan and camping and outdoor accommodation providers.  I am happy to confirm that more than &euro;7.6m was provided to 280 successful applicants in this phase.</p>  <p>  Phase Two supported the tourism transport sector as it was deemed a strategically important sector that enables visitors to access the geographically dispersed Irish tourism offering.  This Phase has seen grants amounting to over &euro;13.3m awarded to 201 applicants.</p>  <p>  Phase One Plus, which is the third Phase of the Scheme, is a continuation of the earlier Phase One.  This phase supported certain tourism businesses that were ineligible or not included in Phase One, or who had missed the deadline.  Under Phase One Plus &euro;1.6m has been provided to 43 applicants.</p>  <p>Phases 4 and 5 of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Tourism Business Continuity Scheme closed for applications on Friday, 24   September.  Phase 4 is to support attractions and activity tourism operators with Phase 5 supporting F&aacute;ilte Ireland-approved tourism accommodation providers.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has begun making payments to successful applicants under Phase 4 and expects to commence payments under Phase 5 by November.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked for a breakdown of the Scheme's allocations and recipients by county.  I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to provide this more detailed information to the Deputy within ten working days.</p></reply>

Throughout the pandemic, I have been actively working with and for the sectors within my remit to ensure that they are supported.  My focus for these engagements is both to find ways to support the sectors during the period of the pandemic as well as charting a path for their recovery after the crisis has passed.  In this regard, I established a number of fora and taskforces where sectoral stakeholders brought their experiences, ideas and policy proposals to my attention. These include:</p><p>- Tourism Recovery Oversight Group;</p><p>- The Hospitality and Tourism Forum which I co-chair with An T&aacute;naiste;</p><p>- The Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce;</p><p>- The Sports Monitoring Group and Expert Group on the Return to Sport;</p><p>- Live Entertainment Working Group;</p><p>- Night-time Economy Taskforce; </p><p>Many of the actions contained in the reports produced by the Tourism Recovery Oversight Group, Arts and Culture Recovery and the Night-Time Economy Taskforces&rsquo; are actively being implemented by my Department, in partnership with other Government stakeholders, and I consider these as essential inputs to our journey towards recovery.  </p><p>Regular meetings of the Sports Monitoring Group at which NGBs provide up-to-date assessments of the status of their operations and the progress being made in relation to the resumption of their particular sports allow Minister Chambers and I to keep up to date on the ongoing COVID-19 impacts to the sports sector. </p><p>My officials and I have also engaged with stakeholders in the media sector in relation to the impact of COVID-19. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is reporting to me quarterly on the impacts of COVID-19 on the independent radio sector.</p><p>I am continuing to work with colleagues across Government to ensure that the sectors within my remit were provided with a range of financial supports and pandemic recovery measures.  These include the horizontal measures of the PUP, EWSS and CRSS. </p><p>Within my own Department, tailored funding measures have been introduced to support all of the sectors under my remit, in specific response to the pandemic, as well as to reflect commitments in the Programme for Government and ongoing policy to support, empower and grow these sectors. </p><p>These measures include a range of funding streams for the live entertainment sector, an Adaptation Fund and a Business Continuity Scheme for the tourism sector delivered through F&aacute;ilte Ireland, a funding package for the sport sector, Gaeltacht supports and increased funding for the Arts Council.</p><p>The sectors under my remit are at the heart of our identity as a people and the pandemic has demonstrated very clearly the critical role they play in social and economic well-being. The resilience of these sectors, in the face of the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, has been remarkable, particularly as many were among the first sectors to close and are the last to return to full capacity. </p><p>Recognising that resilience and the hugely important role that these sectors play in Ireland's collective economic and social well-being, I will continue to work with the stakeholders to  monitor the evolving situation and to work with my Government colleagues to support these sectors and, with officials and Government colleagues, to support a strong and stable recovery as we emerge from the pandemic.</p></reply>

I understand the devastating impact that Covid-19 has had on all areas of the arts and I have endeavoured to make sure that the voices of those in this sector have been heard.  I have personally met with, and continue to meet with, a wide range of organisations and businesses. Officials in my Department are involved in ongoing and meaningful engagement with the numerous organisations and lobby groups in the sector.  This ensures that I have the most up-to-date information to ensure appropriate supports are delivered for the sector.</p><p>The Arts Council is the agency through which Government support for the arts sector is delivered.  In 2021, I allocated a record &euro;130m to the Arts Council to provide for the sector.  In addition, I have to date allocated &euro;61.5m for a suite of measures designed to sustain and support the commercial sector in 2021.  These measures incorporate:</p><p>- &euro;25m Live Performance Support Scheme</p><p>- &euro;14m Music and Entertainment Business Support Scheme</p><p>- &euro;11.5m Event Sector Covid Support Scheme </p><p>- &euro;5m for live performance delivered through the local authorities;</p><p>- &euro;5m Capital Support Scheme</p><p>- &euro;1m Patrick's Day Festival</p><p>I committed during August to securing a reopening plan for the sector through a clear roadmap for the sustainable reopening of activities in the live entertainment, culture and arts sectors.</p><p>At its meeting on 31 August, Government agreed on the return to outdoor and indoor events at the following capacity levels and with maximum available social distancing between groups:</p><p>-  Indoors &ndash; for vaccinated/recovered people and accompanying minors- 60% capacity </p><p>- Outdoors - for vaccinated/recovered people and accompanying minors- 75% capacity </p><p>- Outdoors - for mixed groups of vaccinated/recovered and unvaccinated people &ndash; 50% capacity.  </p><p>All restrictions on numbers attending events will be lifted on 22 October marking a dramatic and  significant positive step for the arts, music and entertainment sector.

The Policy acknowledges the need for action to ensure that more women take up leadership positions in sport including as Board members and CEOs of National Governing Bodies of Sport.  </p>  <p>  Action 32 of the Government&rsquo;s National Sports Policy 2018-2027 tasks National Governing Bodies with developing equality action plans and setting gender diversity targets. It commits to supporting dedicated leadership training programmes for women including governance-related and technical training. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland has put a range of supports in place to assist the sporting organisations. For example, a Gender Diversity on Boards Toolkit was developed and launched in January. It is a resource with practical steps and guidelines applicable to the sports sector in Ireland to work towards more gender diverse Boards. Sport Ireland will host a third webinar for the sports sector on November 25th to remind them of the toolkit and how it might be useful in achieving or maintaining gender diversity on their Board. </p>  <p>  Improving the gender balance on boards of sporting organisations is a priority for both myself and Minister Martin. </p>  <p>  In December 2020, Sport Ireland released a snapshot of board composition figures from across the NGB sector and progress made towards gender balance on boards. This snapshot highlighted that the number of females currently serving on the boards of NGBs has increased to 29%, up from 24% in March 2019. This is good progress but clearly there is work still to be done and Minister Martin and I will continue to engage proactively on this important agenda. </p></reply>

My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have been collaborating with industry and other Government Departments to ensure that there is a coordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages.</p>  <p>  Recently F&aacute;ilte Ireland has launched a new recruitment marketing and awareness campaign called  #BeThePulse to help attract new staff to the tourism industry. F&aacute;ilte Ireland also provided an information webinar on the Department of Social Protection Pathways to Work strategy. The webinar was aimed at ensuring that tourism employers are fully aware of this potential recruitment channel, while also working with employers to make it easier and beneficial to recruit workers and to encourage recruitment of jobseekers. F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Learning Hub also contains free high-quality self-directed learning courses to help upskill staff and build capability within business. </p>  <p>  To increase consideration of a career in tourism and hospitality, F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to promote opportunities and communicate the benefits of working in the industry via their content and social media strategy on tourismcareers.ie.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also chairs the Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group  which works closely with industry bodies, education providers and other Government bodies to support sustainable employment in the tourism sector with an immediate focus on recruitment and retention initiatives.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are engaging with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to explore possible options for the Work Permits regime. Recent submissions from the industry to allow work permits for managerial positions in certain tourism and hospitality businesses are currently being assessed. Officials have also met with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on the implementation of the Tourism Recovery Taskforce recommendations under &ldquo;Enhancing Sustainable Employment&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is currently carrying out research, both from an employer and employee perspective, to gain further understanding of the challenges facing employers and why workers are leaving or not returning to the sector.  This research will help when considering future actions required to address staffing and skill shortages for the sector.</p>  <p>  Informed by the recommendations in the latest report from the Recovery Oversight Group, and in the context of Budget 2022, I am working with officials and Government colleagues to establish what further supports can be put in place for the tourism sector.</p></reply>

The National Development Plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m for the Fund over the period to 2027. </p><p>The first call for proposals under the LSSIF closed in 2019 with applications confined to local authorities and National Governing Bodies (NGBs) of Sport. All applications were assessed in accordance with the published Evaluation Procedures and Guidelines and the first allocations were announced in January 2020. Thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals. These initial allocations include funding for 8 swimming pool projects as follows: </p><p>1. Laois: Portarlington Leisure Centre Swimming Pool</p><p>2. Sligo: Waterpoint Aqua Park </p><p>3. Kilkenny: The Watershed Development, </p><p>4. Limerick: Askeaton Pool and Leisure</p><p>5.

Dublin: Samuel Beckett Civic Campus Phase 2</p><p>The priority in the short term is to advance all LSSIF projects including these swimming pools to  construction stage. </p><p>In relation to future swimming pool funding, my Department is currently undertaking a review of progress on all existing LSSIF grants. As part of this review, my Department is also considering the timing of any new call for proposals and it is expected that the review will be completed in the coming months. In addition, the National Sports Policy commits to the development of a National Swimming Strategy. As part of this, there will be a review of swimming pool provision to identify where gaps exist and how these can be met. Furthermore, a Sports Action Plan, covering the period to end 2023 will be published shortly. It is envisaged that the development of a national swimming strategy will be significantly progressed as a priority action in that plan, with the aim of completing the strategy in early 2022. The outcome of these reviews will be fully considered when deciding on the future funding provision for swimming pools.</p></reply>

My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have been collaborating with industry and other Government Departments to ensure that there is a coordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages.</p>  <p>  Recently F&aacute;ilte Ireland has launched a new recruitment marketing and awareness campaign called #BeThePulse to help attract new staff to the tourism industry. F&aacute;ilte Ireland also provided an information webinar on the Department of Social Protection Pathways to Work strategy. The webinar was aimed at ensuring that tourism employers are fully aware of this potential recruitment channel, while also working with employers to make it easier and beneficial to recruit workers and to encourage recruitment of jobseekers. F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Learning Hub also contains free high-quality self-directed learning courses to help upskill staff and build capability within business. </p>  <p>  To increase appreciation of a career in tourism and hospitality, F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to promote opportunities and communicate the benefits of working in the industry via their content and social media strategy on tourismcareers.ie. F&aacute;ilte Ireland also chairs the Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group  which works closely with industry bodies, education providers and other Government bodies to support sustainable employment in the tourism sector with an immediate focus on recruitment and retention initiatives. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are engaging with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to explore possible options for the Work Permits regime. Recent submissions from the industry to allow work permits for managerial positions in certain tourism and hospitality businesses are currently being assessed. Officials have also met with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on the implementation of the Tourism Recovery Taskforce recommendations under &ldquo;Enhancing Sustainable Employment&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is currently carrying out research, both from an employer and employee perspective, to gain further understanding of the challenges facing employers and why workers are leaving or not returning to the sector.  This research will help when considering future actions required to address staffing and skill shortages for the sector.</p>  <p>  Informed by the recommendations in the latest report from the Recovery Oversight Group, and in the context of Budget 2022, I am working with officials and Government colleagues to establish what further supports can be put in place for the tourism sector.</p></reply>

Allied to the additional current expenditure of &euro;26.3 million already provided to Sport Ireland, this equates to a total of &euro;91.3 million in additional current funding to support the sport sector in 2021.</p>  <p>  Arrangements are currently being made by Sport Ireland for the invitation of applications from NGBs and sports clubs with the aim of distributing this special funding this year. This new package is additional to the &euro;88.5 million that was provided last year, which benefited all levels of the sport sector, including thousands of grassroots clubs and Community Groups across the country.  </p>  <p>  In addition to these financial supports, which benefit young and old alike, I consider that a public information campaign emphasising the benefits of sport can also contribute to a comprehensive resumption to sporting activity. Sport Ireland started such a campaign yesterday under the title of &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Get Back&rdquo;. The campaign will run for the next five weeks and is aimed at encouraging members of the public that are anxious or unsure about returning to sport and physical activity that it is possible to do so in a safe and secure manner.  The campaign will also collaborate with social media influencers and platforms to promote the message to the younger demographic.  The campaign is part of a wider winter initiative to get people back to sport, with activities planned throughout the sports sector, and provides National Governing Bodies with a perfect platform to launch its Autumn and Winter Programmes.</p>  <p>  While the pace and extent of the return to sport for all people, is significantly dependent on the capacity of the various sporting organisations and clubs at local level, I hope that these measures will help support organisations and clubs in bringing as many people, including young people, back to sporting activity as quickly as possible. </p></reply>

Allied to the additional current expenditure of &euro;26.3 million already provided to Sport Ireland, a total of &euro;91.3 million will have been allocated in additional current funding to support the sport sector in 2021.  </p>  <p>  This package is intended to support National Governing Bodies of Sport and sports clubs arising from the significant impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the sports sector. The package includes funding for a swimming pools/facilities fund to assist pools and facilities in reopening. The schemes are being run by Sport Ireland, who are engaging with the sector at present in relation to the application process.  </p>  <p>  In 2020, a total Covid-19 funding package of &euro;88.5 million in current funding was provided to support the sport sector. </p>  <p>  In relation to providing capital assistance for new sports facilities, my Department operates two grant schemes.</p>  <p>  The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country. The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1st March 2021. By the closing date, over 3,100 applications were submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding. This is the highest number of applications ever received.</p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were published earlier this year and all applications are being assessed accordingly. Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on the 6th August. The remaining applications for capital works are now being assessed with allocations expected before the end of this year. Once these allocations are finalised an announcement will made in relation to the opening of the next round of the Programme. </p>  <p>  The Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) is designed for projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals. The priority in the short term is to advance all of these projects. As it is now over 18 months since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review progress on all projects. My Department is engaging with all grantees in this regard. The timing of any new call for proposals is also being considered and it is expected that the Review will be completed in the coming months.</p></reply>

Last year, a Tourism Recovery Taskforce was put in place to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis.  This plan has assisted me and my cabinet colleagues in considering measures that can support the sector. The measures we have adopted to date have been critical for the survival of businesses and jobs in tourism.</p>  <p>  I appointed a Recovery Oversight Group to oversee the implementation of the Plan and they report to me on a regular basis with updates on implementation and the recovery of the sector. This group has recently submitted its third report to me. The report from the Recovery Oversight Group will provide invaluable input to policy as I continue to work, alongside my Government colleagues, to support the tourism sector in this most challenging period. </p>  <p>  The Covid-19 crisis has left our tourism sector in a very weakened state but it has also provided an opportunity now to address sustainable tourism development in a more meaningful way during the recovery and rebuilding phase following the crisis. In line with our Programme for Government commitments, officials within my Department are taking initial steps towards the development of a new national tourism policy which will mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will be informed by the Guiding Principles for Sustainable Tourism Development developed by the Sustainable Tourism Working Group and be consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments. </p>  <p>  It is clear that the traditional model of tourism is changing and the development of this new national tourism policy gives us an opportunity to set out what type of tourism sector we want to 2030 and beyond. Tourism has proven itself resilient before and I am confident that, with the support of Government, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again in a manner which is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.</p></reply>

The Report contained 36 practical recommendations in the area of regulation, licensing, planning, transport, safety and increasing the diversity of activities as part of the night-time offering.  The Report also suggests  practical solutions to help cities, towns and villages which have already faced multiple challenges, find and develop new opportunities including, for example, the pilot initiative to establish new "Night-Time Advisors" in six cities and towns to develop new Night-Time Economy opportunities.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing to implement the actions in the  Report and I was delighted to support a series of late night events across the country as part of Culture Night recently on foot of the Taskforce recommendation in this area. I will continue to work with colleagues across Government to implement the actions in this Report to help support and drive the sector forward.  </p>  <p>  The electronic music and night-club sector is an integral part of the Night-Time Economy and culture and has been one of the hardest hit during this pandemic.  I was delighted to support last week's pilot night-club event in The Button Factory in Temple Bar.   I hope that the learnings from this will help the sector as we head towards a full easing of restrictions in October, subject to ongoing public health advice.  A range of supports and measures from my Department and across other Departments have already been established for hard hit sectors including the arts and creative sectors and the tourism sectors and I will continue to engage with the night-club sector in this context.</p></reply>

In line with the Government's recently published plan, <i>COVID-19: Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting</i>, there was a further significant easing of restrictions on organised indoor sporting activities from the 20th of September.

This is set to include the lifting of remaining restrictions on indoor sporting activity.</p><p>I recently met representatives of the sports sector, including some indoor sports, at which it was apparent that there is a broad welcome to the Government's plan which has generated renewed and improved confidence within the sector and is facilitating a resurgence of interest and commitment amongst sporting organisations, their volunteers and their club memberships. The pace and extent of the return to both indoor and outdoor sports, within the prevailing permitted parameters, is ultimately a matter for each individual sport and is significantly dependent on the capacity of the various sporting organisations and clubs to decide at local level on how best to return.</p></reply>

In 2021, the Government allocated &euro;130m to the Arts Council which is an increase of 62% over the amount initially allocated for 2020. The Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003. The Arts Council announced details of its investment plans last February and this included a range of initiatives aimed at supporting artists and arts organisations. </p>  <p>  From the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, the Arts Council adopted a pro-active approach to supporting individual artists of all genres as well as arts and culture organisations.  One of the Council's first actions was its announcement to honour all existing funding commitments, pre-funding grantees up to 90% of funding to assist with commitments, especially to artists. Since then, the Arts Council have also introduced new and enhanced funding programmes. Further information of these investments can be accessed on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  In 2021, I allocated &euro;50 million for a suite of measures to assist the live performance sector aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.  Included in this package are the following measures:</p>  <p>  - Grants amounting to &euro;25m under the 2021 Live Performance Support Scheme, in addition to &euro;5m in 2020. </p>  <p>  - &euro;14m has  been made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  This Scheme is a demand led scheme a second round is opening shortly. </p>  <p>  - An allocation of &euro;5 million was provided to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.</p>  <p>  - Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff.</p>  <p>  - &euro;11.5m was provided for the entertainment industry, including festivals.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government's horizontal payments were available to the arts sector including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.</p></reply>

The scheme is designed for projects where the grant being sought is greater than the maximum grant available under the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP). The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals.</p>  <p>  An application was received from Wicklow County Council in respect of the project referred to by the Deputy but was not awarded a grant under the first set of allocations.  All applications under the LSSIF were assessed in accordance with the published scoring criteria. The total funding applied for under the scheme significantly exceeded the amount available to allocate and the project referred to by the Deputy did not score sufficiently highly to be awarded a grant under this first set of allocations.</p>  <p>  While the priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects, as it is now over 18 months since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants. My Department is engaging with all grantees in this regard. The scope for awarding new grants to projects which missed out under the first set of allocations is being considered as part of this review as is the timing of any new call for proposals. It is expected that the review will be completed in the coming months.</p>  <p>  With regard to a meeting to discuss the project, my officials are always available in the first instance to meet clubs and groups to discuss their proposals for sporting infrastructure.</p></reply>

The Future of Media Commission has considered the issue of diversity and equality in its deliberations and I am aware that submissions were made to the Commission by Women on Air, an advocacy group for the representation of women on broadcasting media, and by the Equality Expert Group, a collective of experts drawn from a variety of fields, public and private, seeking to support equality and diversity in Irish social, economic and cultural life.  </p><p>The work of the Future of Media Commission has now been completed. The Taoiseach and I have received the report and are considering its contents. The Report will be brought to Government for consideration in due course, and we will then decide on next steps, including in respect of gender equality. </p><p>The Broadcasting Act 2009 sets out the statutory framework for the regulation of sound broadcasting services. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) is the independent regulator for sound broadcasting content in the State. Commercial radio stations are subject to contractual obligations, including public service commitments with the BAI, which are agreed upon during the licensing process. Compliance with such obligations is monitored by the BAI.</p><p>My officials have proactively engaged with the BAI who have been involved in a number of positive actions in relation to gender balance:</p><p>- BAI are currently conducting a review of their Gender Action plan which will inform the development of a new Diversity and Inclusion Strategy. </p><p>- BAI are working with Learning Waves, the training body for the commercial radio sector, to survey all radio broadcasters to gather information regarding diversity/gender policies and processes for commercial radio broadcasters. This is an important step forward for building an evidence base against which future progress can be measured.</p><p>- The BAI has recently launched two reports on diversity and inclusion which were funded through the BAI Media Research Funding Scheme: Auditing Gender &amp;amp; Diversity Change in Irish Media Sectors; and RT&Eacute; &amp;amp; COVID-19 - Diversity and Inclusion and Meeting Public Needs. The reports demonstrate the appetite, among industry players, for increasing diversity and inclusion in the media workforce. </p><p>- Under the BAI&rsquo;s Sound &amp;amp; Vision Funding Scheme, the assessment of applications has included consideration of the number of women in key creative roles, as a measure to support greater gender equality in the industry. This information is then used as an assessment criterion as part of the BAI&rsquo;s assessment process.</p><p>- In addition, Media Literacy Ireland held a webinar on 19<sup>th</sup>July focusing on &lsquo;<i>media literacy and the representation of women in media&rsquo;</i>. This webinar looked at the role media literacy can play in bringing about better representation of women in media.</p><p>In my recent attendance at the AGM of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, I took the opportunity to encourage their members to play their part in ensuring that women are given a voice both on and off air, in their management structures, among presenters and in terms of those artists given airtime.</p><p>My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders in order to further explore appropriate approaches to support gender balance on our broadcasting services. </p></reply>

Our policy approach is aimed at ensuring that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity, regardless of age, social-economic status, disability, or membership of, for example, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community or other ethnic minorities. Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027.</p>  <p>  I will soon be launching a Sports Action Plan covering the period to end 2023, which will include a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. The plan's emphasis will be geared towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport. </p>  <p>  My Department is also funding a wide range of projects from the Dormant Accounts funds that are specifically aimed at increasing participation levels amongst disadvantaged communities and people with a disability. The total amount of funding being allocated for such projects this year is &euro;10M, twice the amount that prevailed a number of years ago.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would also like to emphasise the important contribution that Sport Ireland makes in this area. Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards. The Deputy will be interested to note that Sport Ireland is in the process of developing a specific Diversity and Inclusion policy which is expected to be launched by the end of this year. </p></reply>

I have personally met with numerous representative organisations and officials in my Department, including those mentioned by the Deputy, and have continued contact with these organisations and others on a regular basis throughout the pandemic.  </p><p>My priorities for the budget, beyond securing funding for a Basic Income Pilot Scheme for Artists and Arts Workers, is to secure funding to support the full recovery of the arts/culture and live entertainment sectors in 2022. The Government understands that the full return of live performance will not happen overnight. I am examining the supports in place for the sector to ensure that available resources are best deployed to meet the needs of the sector to ensure a full recovery is possible. </p><p>In relation to the Basic Income Guarantee pilot, the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce report <i>Life Worth Living</i>, was published in November 2020 and made ten recommendations for the sector. I believe the delivery of this pilot will be key to underpinning the recovery in the arts and culture sector and will provide much needed certainty to the artists and creatives who choose to avail of the pilot scheme.</p><p>I was delighted that as part of the National Economic Recovery Plan, I secured a commitment from Government to prioritise the development of a Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme for the arts and cultural sector.</p><p>I established an Oversight Group to appraise the recommendations in the <i>Life Worth Living </i>report and asked that they prioritise the examination of the Recommendation on a basic income guarantee pilot scheme for artists and arts workers. The Oversight Group has provided me with a preliminary report on the different options for a 3 year pilot scheme which I am currently considering.  I expect to be making a proposal for a Basic Income as part of the Budget 2022 discussions, after which further details should be available on how the pilot scheme will be progressed.</p><p>I envision that this pilot should launch in early 2022 and I believe it will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector, after the difficult circumstances they have endured over the last year and a half. </p><p>Further stakeholder engagement will take place between my Department and those in the Sector to ensure that this pilot meets the needs of the sector alongside the objectives agreed by the Oversight Group.</p></reply>

I understand the devastating impact that Covid-19 has had on all areas of the arts and I have endeavoured to make sure that the voices of those in this sector have been heard and that concrete measures are in place to support the sector.  I have personally met with, and continue to meet with, a wide range of organisations and businesses. Officials in my Department are involved in ongoing and meaningful engagement with the numerous organisations and lobby groups in the sector.  This ensures that I have the most up-to-date information to ensure appropriate supports were delivered for the sector.</p><p>In 2021, public investment in the arts through the Arts Council has reached a historically high level of &euro;130 million. Throughout the crisis, the Arts Council has been focused on protecting jobs and livelihoods of artists and arts workers, assisting arts organisations experiencing financial difficulties,  working to encourage audiences to re-engage with in-person events in a safe environment, and supporting and developing the sector more broadly. New foundations for sustainability were also  laid in 2020/2021 through the operation of the Arts Council's Sustainability Fund.  </p><p>A detailed report and analysis of the Arts Council&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis for the arts in 2020/2021 has been published by the Council and can be accessed at this link:  www.artscouncil.ie/uploadedFiles/wwwartscouncilie/Content/Publications/Research_reports/Our%20Covid%20Response%20(July%202021).pdf.  It also contains research on the pandemic&rsquo;s impacts on cultural organisations, artists and audiences.</p><p>In addition, my Department and the Arts Council have introduced a range of measures in response to the recommendations set out in <i>Life Worth Living</i>, the report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce.  <i></i></p><p>In the area of live performance, a combination of horizontal state supports in the form of the PUP and EWSS and sector specific supports offered by my Department provided enhanced stability for the sector.  My Department's supports included the MEBAS scheme, the Events Sector COVID Support Scheme and the Live Performance Support Scheme as well as supports local authority live events programming. </p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Bill is to amend the Official Languages Act 2003 with a view to increasing and improving the provision of public services through the Irish language. Central to these efforts will be a series of provisions which aim to increase the number of Irish speakers recruited to the public service.</p>  <p>  The increased and improved provision of public services though the Irish language will ensure that issues regarding the provision of State services through Irish to both Irish speakers and Gaeltacht communities will be addressed, along with challenges and opportunities regarding the recruitment of Irish speakers to public bodies. Among the measures to be introduced by the Bill is the introduction of  language standards to replace language schemes. </p>  <p>  The publication of the Official Languages Amendment Bill in 2019 was broadly welcomed at the time. However, a number of concerns were expressed on the need for target dates or a timetable for initiatives provided for in the Bill. In order to address these concerns, I will be bringing 32 amendments before the House at Report Stage. Key amendments include the following measures:</p>  <p>  - A requirement that 20% of new recruits to the public service be competent in the Irish language by 31st December 2030.</p>  <p>  - An obligation on the Minister to specify by Regulation - within 3 months of receipt of the National Plan for the Provision of Irish-Medium Public Services already provided for in the Bill - dates by which all public services will be provided in Irish in each of the 26 statutory Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas  and by which all public offices in these Language Planning Areas will operate through the medium of Irish. This provision will complement the provisions contained in the Gaeltacht Act 2012 relating to the development of language plans in Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, the full implementation of which will depend greatly on the provision of public services in the Irish language to these communities.</p>  <p>  - A requirement that each public body carry out at least 20% of its annual advertising in the Irish language and 5% in the Irish language media.</p>  <p>  - A requirement that the use of the s&iacute;neadh fada be accommodated in all ICT systems operated by public bodies.</p>  <p>  - A requirement for any commercial operator providing public services under contract to a public body to make provision for the use of the Irish language as part of those services.</p>  <p>  - The replacement of the Placenames Commission with a statutory Placenames Committee to advise the Minister with regard to the making of Placenames Orders.</p>  <p>  These amendments will further strengthen the Bill and thus the rights of Irish language speakers. </p></reply>

It set out a range of measures designed to enable the creative potential of every young person, both within the formal education system and in community settings. While the Creative Youth Plan aims to promote engagement in creative activities in the broadest sense, it embraces amongst other things the arts as a mechanism through which children and young people can experience creativity.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Plan is led by my Department in partnership with the Department of Education, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Arts Council.  Significant progress on the delivery of its objectives has been achieved to date, and details are available from the Creative Ireland Programme website.</p>  <p>  While Creative Youth is not specifically an Arts in Education strategy it does support a number of specific education-based initiatives which aim to provide greater opportunity to whole school communities to engage with all forms of creativity.  It is worth noting that the Plan proposes a broader long-term objective &ndash; to help promote a society in which knowledge and creativity are equal partners in the formation of our young people and where schools can support creativity and innovation in teaching and learning in an integrated way.</p>  <p>  Creative Schools, which is delivered by the Arts Council, supports schools to put arts and creativity at the heart of school life, supporting them to develop and implement their own creative plan, while strengthening the relationships between schools and the broader cultural and community infrastructure.  The Creative Clusters Programme, a programme delivered by my colleague Minister Foley, enables groups of up to five schools to collaborate on an innovative arts and creative projects to address a common issue or challenge.  Earlier this year Minister Foley also announced a new initiative, titled BLAST (Bringing Live Arts to Schools and Teachers), which will support up to 400 new artist residencies in schools each year.</p>  <p>  In addition to these programmes, Creative Youth also supports Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programmes for teachers at both primary and post-primary.  While the focus of this CPD is wider than arts, it encompasses the arts and endeavours to ensure that children and young people enjoy the benefits from participation and exposure to the arts and creative activities.</p>  <p>  While my Department continues to support the Creative Youth initiatives, primary responsibility for engagement with the arts as part of the school curriculum rests with my colleague, Minister Foley.</p></reply>

In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure their ongoing relevance to the State&rsquo;s human capital requirements, they undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews. The reviews are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public/stakeholder consultation.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by my Department and of the relevant policy Departments.</p>  <p>  A number of printer roles are currently included on the Ineligible Occupations List at present.  In order to add or remove an occupation from the lists, evidence is sought demonstrating that recruitment difficulties are solely due to genuine shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions. The review process invites stakeholders, through the public consultation, to provide data to substantiate claims of lack of skills or labour availability in a detailed evidence-based business case. Sectors are also advised to engage in a systematic and structured manner with the public employment service of the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  A review of the occupations lists for employment permits is currently well underway with submissions received under active consideration. The Economic Migration Policy Unit of my Department informs me that no submissions were received from the print industry. It is expected that the review will be finalised in the coming weeks and any changes necessary to deal with verified skills or labour shortages will be made at that time.  The next review will commence with a public consultation soon after, with commencement announced on the Department's website.  Contact details may also be forwarded to the Department for those who wish to receive email notification of the consultation phase.</p></reply>

The objective of the Strategy is to ensure remote work is a permanent feature of the Irish workplace in a way that maximises the economic, social and environmental benefits.</p>  <p>  The Strategy contains 15 actions to progress remote work into the future. Each action has been attributed actors for its delivery and a deadline of this year. Lead actors report progress on the actions to the Interdepartmental Group (IDG) on Remote Work. This IDG has met three times to date this year. At these meetings it was established that good progress is underway to achieving actions by their deadlines. </p>  <p>  A number of key achievements have been made to date in line with the Strategy such as the following:</p>  <p>  - My Department is currently developing new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024 in which there will be a focus on promoting remote working opportunities and investing in infrastructures across the nine regions. My Department also recently announced &euro;10 million in funding for a new Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme. This scheme is administered by Enterprise Ireland includes a &euro;500,000 Feasibility Study to assist enterprise development projects, including the development of remote working and enterprise infrastructure.</p>  <p>  - ConnectedHubs.ie- Ireland&rsquo;s first national digital hub network- was launched by the Department of Rural and Community Development at the end of May. ConnectedHubs.ie is an online platform which provides information about the facilities available at remote working hubs throughout Ireland, and enables users to book spaces, desks, offices and events in hubs for short- and long-term use. ConnectedHubs.ie will ultimately link over 400 hubs throughout the country. The Connected Hubs Call has awarded funding of &euro;8.8m to 117 remote working hub projects in July to upgrade Ireland&rsquo;s remote work infrastructure.</p>  <p>  - In April 2021, the Workplace Relations Commission published the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect which will help employees to strike a better work-life balance and to switch off from work outside of normal working hours. </p>  <p>  - In April/May 2021 a Public Consultation on the Right to Request Remote Work was held by my Department. The arising submissions were published in August 2021 and work is underway on the next steps required for this legislation.</p>  <p>  - Discussions are ongoing to find ways through which the rollout of the National Broadband Plan can be accelerated in order to improve connectivity in all parts of Ireland.</p>  <p>  - Remote Work promotion and skills training is underway by a range of agencies including EI, IDA Ireland, WDC, Skillnet Ireland and the ETBs.</p>  <p>  - In June 2021, the Government launched the &lsquo;Making Remote Work&rsquo; campaign across broadcast, print and social media to promote the Guidance for Working Remotely webpage. This webpage acts as a central access point for employers and employees and brings together the existing State guidance, legislation and advice on remote work into one place. The webpage includes an Employer Checklist to provide employers with a quick way to successfully navigate the adoption of remote working arrangements. The Government is encouraging workers and employers to discuss the kinds of remote working arrangements that may be suitable for their organisations.</p></reply>

As an advisory committee the Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee itself is not funded directly. Costs associated with the work of the Committee are contained within the overall budget of the HSA. </p><p>At the beginning of the year, the HSA has estimated an expenditure of approximately &euro;500,000 on specific agricultural sector initiatives throughout the year.</p><p>The Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee was established to involve all industry stakeholders in improving occupational safety and health in the Agricultural sector. The Committee is a consultative and advisory forum on the determination of the HSA&rsquo;s priorities and work programme for the Agricultural Sector. It develops and agrees a national action plan, coordinating the actions of working groups and representative organisations, and, also, identifies, prioritises and progresses the key actions related to improving safety and health standards in the Agriculture Sector.</p><p>The Farm Safety Partnership Advisory Committee, and its working groups, are made up of representatives and experts from various relevant agricultural organisations including the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association, Macra na Feirme, Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors in Ireland, Farm Relief Service, Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA) and Teagasc.</p><p>The work of the Committee is set out in Farm Safety Action Plans. In August 2021, the Health and Safety Authority published the current Farm Safety Action Plan 2021 &ndash; 2024. The aim of the new Farm Safety Action Plan is to reduce fatalities, serious injuries and ill health in the agriculture sector. Five critical areas for have been identified for attention: </p><p>- Behaviour, Education and Training</p><p>- Health and Vulnerable Persons </p><p>- Tractor, High Risk Machinery </p><p>- Livestock Handling  </p><p>- Buildings, Work at Height  </p><p>The HSA, through its Agricultural Policy Unit, provides practical assistance and support to achieve the goals and objectives contained within the Farm Safety Action Plan.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is also delivering initiatives to promote farm safety, particularly through the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS II). A wide range of farm safety related investments are available which are grant-aided under the suite of seven TAMS measures. Grant aid of approximately &euro;6.0 million has been spent on specific farm safety investments in TAMS II since the scheme opened in 2015. </p></reply>

The Scheme was superseded as part of Budget 2021 by the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) operated by Revenue.</p>  <p>  As announced in June this year by the Minister for Finance, a new additional support for businesses impacted by Covid-19 is now available. The Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), operated by Revenue, is open for registration via the e-Registration facility in ROS. Once registered, eligible businesses can make a claim at any time up to 30 November 2021 for the single payment support via the eRepayments facility in ROS.</p>  <p>  The BRSS is a targeted support for companies, self-employed individuals, partnerships as well as certain charities and sporting bodies that carry on a trade that was significantly impacted by Covid-19 public health restrictions, including where the impact has continued after the easing of the restrictions. The scheme is available to businesses that were actively trading on 1 September 2021 and intend to continue doing so. </p>  <p>  A qualifying person may make a claim under BRSS for a single payment which will be equal to three times the average weekly turnover of the relevant business activity for the applicable reference period as follows:  10% of average weekly turnover up to &euro;20,000, 5% of average weekly turnover above &euro;20,000, and subject to a maximum payment of &euro;15,000. Further details are available from Revenue at www.revenue.ie/en/self-assessment-and-self-employment/brss/index.aspx.</p>  <p>  The range of measures taken by government, such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme, the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), the BRSS, and sector-specific measures such as business continuity grants and the lower VAT rate, have all been critical in supporting businesses and jobs.  Details of the wide range of supports available are noted on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.enterprise.gov.ie/en/Publications/Supports-for-businesses-COVID-19.html.</p>  <p>  The Government will carefully consider any additional measures required to ensure that Budget 2022 addresses key priorities for business survival and recovery such as continued business continuity and employee supports.</p></reply>

I also engaged with representatives from multinational companies at a private roundtable hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce, and gave a public address at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Ireland's Ambassador to the United States, Ambassador Mulhall, hosted a dinner at this Official Residence on the evening of 27th at which I was able to engage with a number of prominent Irish American Senators and Members of Congress, officials from the White House and the current Biden/Harris Administration, as well as members of the business and economic communities.

There are a number of these schemes operating in Ireland and they have proved very successful in enabling us meet domestic and EU recycling targets. The EPR scheme for farm plastics has been in place since 1998 and has grown significantly since then. The existing arrangements are functioning very effectively and the targets in place are being achieved, with a recycling rate for 2020 reaching 80% significantly exceeding the target of 70%.</p>  <p>  The regulations allow for any organisation to apply to the Minister for approval to operate a scheme. Any application will be assessed and evaluated by the Department. There is currently one approved body operating a farm plastic scheme, Irish Farm Film Plastics Group (IFFPG). Their approval was renewed earlier this year following a lengthy process and the renewal will last for a five year period, subject to periodic reviews. </p>  <p>  The current funding mechanisms used by IFFPG for farm plastic collection is in line with the polluter pays principle and EU requirements, with producers funding 70% of the necessary costs of the scheme and farmers contributing the remaining  30% of the costs. The fees collected are used by the operator to fund the operational costs of the scheme which is run on a not for profit basis. </p>  <p>  Local authorities have a key role in ensuring compliance with the farm plastics regulations and broader waste legislation obligations. The Department supports local authorities taking appropriate enforcement action against individuals or corporate entities through the appropriate channels. The Department is also aware that the National Trans Frontier Shipment Office (NTFSO) are liaising with a number of local authorities to ascertain the extent of the storage of farm plastics and the implications for waste shipments abroad.  An effective system of waste management compliance is critical to the welfare of the environment and society in general. </p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to lower income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme leaving them better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. During the first 6 months of 2021, the approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was &euro;17,100.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 7,000 homeowners on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme who have never received any upgrade works under the scheme. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in the first half of 2021, the average time from application to completion was almost 26 months. The SEAI has advised me that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.</p>  <p>  Revisits under this scheme are currently not available. This enables the work programme to prioritise eligible homes that have not previously received free upgrades under the scheme. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will be finalised and published shortly. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emission reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer.</p></reply>

To date, over 143,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme.  In the first six months of 2021, the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was approximately &euro;17,100.</p>  <p>  There are currently just over 7,000 homeowners on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. Data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicates that for homes completed in the first half of 2021, the longest time waiting for a survey from application date was approximately 23 months countrywide and the average time from application to completion was approximately 26 months countrywide. The SEAI has advised me that wait times vary, based on the demand for the scheme at the time of application as well as other factors including the scale of works to be completed, access to the property, availability of materials and the weather.  The average wait times have increased significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity in place between January and mid-April when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Wait times have also been negatively impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead times for materials. </p>  <p>  Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased significantly to over &euro;109 million in 2021, with &euro;100 million allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme. This is an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty.  The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. I have also secured additional resources this year to expand the capacity of the SEAI to deliver the scheme. In addition, delivery capacity in the supply chain has increased due to a new, broader contractor panel that commenced at the end of 2020.  Every effort is being made to maximise output now that construction activity in the residential sector has recommenced.</p></reply>

These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. </p>  <p>  In line with the Programme for Government, NBI and my Department are also engaged in a review of potential measures that can be taken to accelerate the network rollout in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19. My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. As part of that work NBI is engaging with current build partners (eir and enet) to bring forward build activities and is also actively reviewing other possible build partners where such options could also speed up the build process. However, the primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that NBI's build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list. </p></reply>

Since 2007, Atlantic salmon in Ireland are managed on an individual catchment basis, and strictly in line with annual scientific advice, in more than 140 rivers each of which has a generically unique population.</p><p>IFI advise that independent scientific assessment is carried out every year based on fish counters, salmon rod and commercial catches to determine if rivers are meeting conservation limits, established for each river stock. These annual assessments support IFI&rsquo;s annual management advice. </p><p>The status of Irish rivers stocks over the last five years is summarised in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Irish Salmon River Status</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No. of Rivers Open</td>       <td>44</td>       <td>41</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>39</td>       <td>48</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No. of Rivers Catch and Release</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>36</td>       <td>40</td>       <td>42</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No. of Rivers Closed</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>66</td>       <td>63</td>       <td>63</td>       <td>64</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Salmon in its migratory stage at sea are a substantial mix of stocks from Irish and other European rivers, many of which are below safe biological limits. It is not possible to disaggregate these stocks during the marine stage of their life cycle and IFI&rsquo;s focus is on assessment and protection of native river stocks. </p><p>Full details on the status of Irish salmon stocks for 2020 is available via the <i>Report of the Technical Expert Group on Salmon to the North-South Standing Scientific Committee for Inland Fisheries </i>which can be sourced at the Inland Fisheries Ireland Website &ndash; www.fisheriesireland.ie</p><p>IFI also publishes an annual Wild Salmon and Sea Trout Statistics report also available on its website. </p></reply>

A summary report of the submissions received has been published on my Department's website.</p><p>While the primary aim of a micro-generation scheme is to allow electricity users to meet their own electricity needs, it is intended that a suitable payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewables self-consumers later this year, subject to regulatory arrangements, and in line with transposition of Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED II). </p><p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has published a draft framework outlining the details, including eligibility criteria and timescales for introduction, of a Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff for exported renewable electricity. Details can be found on the CRU website: www.cru.ie. When enacted, this framework will introduce an obligation on electricity suppliers to offer remuneration to their customers, by way of a CEG payment, for excess renewable electricity exported to the grid by eligible micro- and small-scale generators. I understand that the CRU consultation will last four weeks, with a decision expected to be published in November.</p><p>The legal basis for the enabling framework is dependent on the transposition of the relevant articles of RED II and Directive (EU) 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market for electricity (IMED), which establish the renewables self-consumer model of electricity generation. My Department is engaging with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on transposing these Articles into Irish law and it is intended that this will be achieved before the end of this year. </p></reply>

Any such transfer is subject to agreement between the parties, completion of the required due diligence and provision of the applicable consents of the Ministers for Transport and Public Expenditure and Reform and the agreement of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Before any possible transfer is executed, it remains the responsibility of Shannon Group to operate and manage the Shannon Heritage business in line with its commercial mandate, fiduciary best practice and with awareness of the Group&rsquo;s accountability for the proper management of the Company.  </p>  <p>  In compliance with State aid rules, funding on an exceptional basis was provided to Shannon Heritage at the end of December to cover the incremental costs incurred when the sites were open during the winter of 2020.  The funding provided is in addition to the economy-wide supports Government has put in place including the TWSS/EWSS, rates waiver and COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), all of which have been availed of by Shannon Heritage.</p>  <p>  The position in relation to the opening of Shannon Heritage sites is a matter for Shannon Group.  In this regard, Shannon Group has advised my Department that given the impacts of COVID-19 (lack of international traffic, low level of domestic visitors) and the resultant significant losses, it is not viable to keep the heritage sites open in line with its pre-COVID-19 operating model.  In this regard, Government has been informed that, in order to mitigate the losses incurred, Shannon Heritage has made a decision to operate on a seasonal basis.</p>  <p>  With regard to the transfer of the sites to local authorities and issues in relation to staffing, industrial relations matters are in the first instance a matter for the Group, staff and relevant staff representatives. I understand that Shannon Group are engaging with the staff of Shannon Heritage with regard to the transfer of the sites.  This engagement has included an onsite briefing by the CEO and management, Group briefings and also regular Union meetings as well as continued engagement on a day-to-day basis.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the matter of lease holders and engagement with Shannon Group, this is a matter for the Group as part of its normal business activities.  On the Deputy&rsquo;s behalf, I have however requested further information from Shannon Group on this issue and have been informed that Shannon Group has communicated with all lease holders advising them that Shannon Heritage will continue to operate Bunratty Castle &amp;amp; Folk Park and that there will be no change to the leaseholders relationship with Shannon Heritage with the exception that Clare County Council will own Shannon Heritage once the transfer has been completed.  </p></reply>

The purpose of the Study is to identify transport demand drivers in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway, and to assess the impact and suitability of an array of different demand management measures for each city. The Study focuses on addressing four main challenges facing our cities: decarbonisation, air quality, congestion, and, ban environment. The Study is evidence-based using insight from an extensive international best practice review, national and local stakeholder engagement and supported by detailed qualitative (Phase 1) and quantitative (Phase 2) appraisal. </p><p>The Phase 1 Report was published in April 2021 (available from: </p><p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/63517-publication-of-five-cities-demand-management-study-phase-1-report-and-toolkits/ </p><p>The Phase 2 Report is anticipated in late 2021.</p><p>In recognition of the new <i>Climate Act</i>, which legislates for carbon neutrality by 2050 and 51% emissions reduction by 2030, my Department has engaged in analysis in recent months to reach our 2030 emission reduction target, which will be outlined in the <i>Climate Action Plan 2021, </i>which the Government will publish shortly. Alongside a reduction in overall travel demand and a shift to sustainable mobility, a general reduction in conventional, fossil-fuelled kilometres will be required to reduce emissions in line with this target. The <i>Five Cities Demand Management Study </i>will set out a range of measures that can be used to achieve this goal.<i></i>While this will require a fundamental change in our approach to travel and transport, it is vital to ensure a sustainable, emission-free transport system for the future.</p></reply>

I have therefore referred this part of the question to the Authority for direct reply.  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.  </p><p>Due to the suspension of driver testing services in the initial pandemic response, along with the health protocols required since the resumption of services, services are operating well below normal capacity and a significant backlog has developed. </p><p>In line with the gradual reopening of services this Summer, driving tests for all those who are eligible to take the test and have been waiting longest have now recommenced. Critical frontline workers continue to be the priority for the driver testing service.  </p><p>My Department is liaising with the RSA on an ongoing basis to meet the growing demand for tests.An additional 40 temporary driver testers have been authorised along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020. These testers have been recruited and trained and commenced testing in July. </p><p>In addition, sanction was granted at the end of June to add a further 40 testers to the cohort.</p><p>As of the 27th of September, the RSA has increased the number of tests from 6 to 7 per tester per day. Extended operating hours and expanded facilities at existing centres or new centres where appropriate include other measures being taken. </p><p>The number of tests scheduled is increasing on a gradual basis. However, it should be noted that approximately 5% of all tests scheduled are not conducted or are abandoned on the day for a number of reasons (e.g. no NCT, insurance not valid etc). In addition, it is very disappointing to note that a number of people do not turn up on the day for their scheduled test. The RSA has been working hard to reduce this &ldquo;no show&rdquo; rate, which was 10% and the volume of &ldquo;no shows&rdquo; has now dropped to an average of 2.18%.</p><p>The health of both the public and the testers themselves must take priority, and as a result it is important to recognise that it will take time to get driver testing waiting times back to normal pre-Covid levels. </p></reply>

Article 12 of this regulation requires that where mobility equipment or assistive devices are lost or damaged whilst being handled at the airport or transported on board aircraft, the passenger to whom the equipment belongs shall be compensated, in accordance with the rules of international, EU and national law. The rules that apply in that case are those of the Montreal Convention, which calculates compensation for damaged equipment by weight rather than value.</p>  <p>  The final report of the Steer consultation, commissioned by the European Commission and published in 2020, recognised that this is a significant issue for disability rights, as compensation for damaged equipment may be limited to around &euro;1,400, when the price of some mobility equipment may be much higher. I believe that a number of airlines have waived the compensation limit in the case of loss or damage to mobility equipment. </p>  <p>  Any proposals regarding changes to the classification of mobility equipment during air travel is best considered in an EU-wide context. Regulation 1107/2006 is under review at EU level along with Regulation 261/2004 on air passenger rights. The progress this review has, however, been impacted by the international travel crisis precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

NTA figures also show a steady increase in the proportion of taxi drivers working over the last few months: from 36% of all drivers working in January 2021 to 62% working in June 2021. I expect these trends to continue as restrictions are lifted in line with public health advice.</p><p>I understand that at the height of the pandemic as many as 70% of SPSV drivers availed of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) which, as the Deputy will be aware, has been extended to February 2022. Self-employed SPSV operators in receipt of the PUP can continue to claim it and earn up to &euro;960 in a given 8-week period, net of expenses. As society continues to reopen and passenger demand for taxis increases, this will become an increasingly important support for drivers as they return to work. Drivers coming off the PUP can avail of the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Grant, worth up to &euro;1,000 to meet the costs associated with returning to work, and which will remain in place for the rest of the year for self-employed people who close their PUP claim.</p><p>In relation to standard licence renewal fees for SPSV, these were waived in 2021 and I can confirm that they will be waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million. </p><p>Many of the major costs associated with operating a taxi, such as insurance and dispatch operator fees, can be deferred or cancelled during a period of inactivity. My Department has funded additional measures targeted at the statutory costs faced by SPSV operators which cannot be deferred. I have allocated &euro;3.5 million towards the refund of NCT test fees and Motor Tax for SPSV operators for a 12-month period. The schemes are administered by the NTA and commenced on 1 September 2021, running until 30 August 2022.</p><p>The replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator. The NTA extended age limits several times since the start of the pandemic, with standard age limits for taxis and hackneys now waived through to the end of 2022, thereby ensuring no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle. </p><p>I nevertheless remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles. That is why I increased the funding available to the Electric SPSV (eSPSV) grant scheme for 2021 to &euro;15 million, up from &euro;1 million the previous year. I also doubled the amount payable under the scheme to &euro;20,000 for operators who scrap older vehicles and make the switch to full electric models. The take up rate for this scheme has been exceptionally high and the scheme recently closed to new applications following the exhaustion of this year's allocation for the scheme. I expect to announce a further eSPSV scheme for 2022 as part of the forthcoming budget. </p></reply>

My Department, in cooperation with the National Transport Authority (NTA), An Taisce and Cycling Ireland, has carried out significant work in this space this year, and will continue to do so into 2022. </p><p>I was delighted to launch the Safe Routes to School Programme earlier this year. This Programme aims to create safer walking and cycling routes within communities, alleviate congestion at the school gates and increase the number of students who walk or cycle to school by providing new or improved walking and cycling facilities. The Programme is funded directly to local authorities as part of the Department of Transport&rsquo;s 2021 allocation to the NTA and is supported by the Department of Education and coordinated by An Taisce&rsquo;s Green Schools team.</p><p>By the deadline of 16<sup>th</sup>April 2021, 932 applications had been received from schools in every county in Ireland. 170 schools have been included in the first round of the Programme. The schools selected were assessed against a range of criteria including school type, location and the school&rsquo;s commitment to sustainable travel. The remaining schools that applied this year will not be required to reapply as they will come into the Programme on a rolling basis.</p><p>The Safe Routes to School Programme has eight stages, from Stage 1: <i>Dissemination of Information</i>to Stage 8: <i>Delivery</i>. The six-person Infrastructure Officer team in An Taisce Green Schools has already completed Stages 1 to 3 (<i>Dissemination</i>, <i>Expression of Interest</i>and <i>Selection of Schools</i>) and have engaged with all Local Authorities as part of Stage 4, <i>Communication and Liaison</i>. Stage 4 and 5 (<i>Production of outline delivery plans</i>) will continue during 2021.</p><p>Stage 8 (<i>Delivery</i>) is dependent on the types of interventions proposed and exact timelines are not yet available. Some simple individual projects, for example pedestrian crossings, may be completed by year end. Bigger interventions such as footpaths or cycle tracks or those that may require planning permission will take longer to deliver. </p><p>Separately, cycle parking is already actively being delivered as part of the STRS Programme. 251 schools will receive cycle parking in 2021 and approximately 380+ schools will receive cycle parking in 2022.</p><p>Additionally, Cycle Right cycle training continues to be carried out by Cycling Ireland in primary schools across the country, funded by my Department. The number of students who received training in 2021 was lower than other years due to school closures as a result of COVID-19 restrictions; however as we emerge from these restrictions Cycling Ireland aims to build on pre-COVID figures by approximately 5,000 students per annum from 2022 onwards.</p><p>In terms of Green Schools Travel, administered by An Taisce, the Department continues to fund this programme through the NTA. Noting the NTA&rsquo;s role in the oversight of the Green Schools Travel programme, I have referred this PQ to the NTA for direct reply in relation to its 2021 achievements and targets for 2022 and beyond. If the Deputy does not receive a response within 10 working days, please contact my private office.</p></reply>

However, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.   Irish Rail has developed a 5-year programme, involving upgrades, renewals and improved maintenance strategies for its lifts and escalators which will provide direct benefits to customers through improved reliability and availability of lifts and escalator assets.  Subject to funding, lifts in 52 stations across the rail network are earmarked for investment up to 2024. The intent of this programme is to renew and replace life-expired lifts and lifts in poor condition, to ensure the reliability and availability of lift access. </p>  <p>  In 2020 the National Transport Authority (NTA) established a rail lift refurbishment/replacement programme, under the Capital Programme, with a &euro;3.3m ring fenced allocation. A major part of the programme in 2020 was the upgrading of lifts at 12 stations in the Dublin Suburban area. For 2021, &euro;3.84m was originally ring-fenced by the NTA from the Capital Programme to the Lift and Escalator Renewal Programme. An additional &euro;2m was allocated to the Programme in November 2020, as part of Budget 2021, bringing the total allocated to the Lifts and Escalator Renewal Programme to &euro;5.84m this year. The additional allocation will enable the acceleration of the delivery of the 5-year programme.</p>  <p>  I have also referred the Deputy's question to Irish Rail for direct reply in relation to the specific stations mentioned.

The preparation of the necessary legislative proposals in regard to the regulation of horse-drawn carriages in Dublin is a complex issue requiring engagement by my Department with several stakeholders, including Dublin City Council. </p>  <p>  Work on this issue unfortunately did not progress as planned in 2020 due to the need to prioritise work in other areas in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this work is once again progressing and officials from my Department are working with Dublin City Council to consider how best to safely repeal the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55, which vests the power to regulate horse-drawn carriages in Dublin with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, to whom An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the successor. </p>  <p>  The development of legislation of this nature, which involves the repeal of legislation which pre-dates the foundation of the State, is complex and technical and so I am unable to provide a definitive timeline for the completion of this work. However, once the current process of stakeholder engagement has been satisfactorily completed, I plan to seek approval from Government to publish the finalised General Scheme without delay. Naturally, once the General Scheme has been published I will be in touch with the Chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications in relation to pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></reply>

Critical frontline workers continue to be the priority for the driver testing service.</p>  <p>  My Department is liaising with the RSA on an ongoing basis to meet the growing demand for tests.  An additional 40 temporary driver testers have been authorised along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020. These testers have been recruited and trained and commenced testing in July. </p>  <p>  In addition, sanction was granted at the end of June to add a further 40 testers to the cohort.  </p>  <p>  As of the 27th of September, the RSA has increased its operating capacity from 6 to 7 tests per tester per day. Extended operating hours and expanded facilities at existing centres or new centres where appropriate include other measures being taken. </p>  <p>  These resources will enable the RSA, which is funded through the fees it receives for the services it provides, under the Road Safety Authority Act, to address the backlogs.  The question of providing additional financial resources does not therefore arise.</p>  <p>  The number of tests scheduled is increasing on a gradual basis. However, it should be noted that approximately 5% of all tests scheduled are not conducted or are abandoned on the day for a number of reasons (e.g. no NCT, insurance not valid etc). In addition, it is very disappointing to note that a number of people do not turn up on the day for their scheduled test. The RSA has been working hard to reduce this &ldquo;no show&rdquo; rate, which was 10% and the volume of &ldquo;no shows&rdquo; has now dropped to an average of 2.18%.</p>  <p>  The health of both the public and the testers themselves must take priority, and as a result it is important to recognise that it will take time to get driver testing waiting times back to normal pre-Covid levels.</p></reply>

However, as the Deputy will be aware, neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor do we have the power to direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific businesses or individuals. This position is reinforced by the EU Solvency II Directive framework. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, the Government firmly understands these issues and is working to address them through the Action Plan for Insurance Reform.  This whole-of-Government approach sets out 66 actions that aim to improve both the cost and supply of this key financial service, particularly for businesses and voluntary organisations &ndash; including those involved in the arts. An Implementation Report of the Action Plan was published in July and shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions now completed. </p><p>One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines which was realised several months ahead of schedule. They should help to bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such reinforce the benefits of using the PIAB to settle claims. This in turn should further reduce the costs of claims, particularly legal fees. I have previously set out my view that these costs, rather than the profit component, tend to represent a bigger factor in the cost of insurance premiums. As such, it is important that they are lowered.  </p><p>As Minister for Finance, my expectation is that insurers should reflect the savings from reduced award levels to customers. In meetings between Minister of State Fleming and CEOs of the main Irish insurers they indicated they will begin lowering premiums in response to the Guidelines. Government will hold them to account on this commitment.</p><p>In addition, work being led by the Minister of Justice to review the law on Occupiers&rsquo; Liability and the Duty of Care should also contribute to easing the insurance difficulties facing artists and arts organisations. I understand that legislative proposals to reform the law in this area are at an advanced stage and are expected to be brought to Government for approval shortly.</p><p>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that work remains ongoing across Government to deliver further elements of the <i>Action Plan</i>, including measures to reform the PIAB and reduce fraud. It is my hope that the implementation of these key actions in particular should go some way to improving the availability and affordability of insurance for all, including artists and arts organisations.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation.

However, the position is that the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is an economy wide support. The objective of EWSS is to support all employment and to maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The scheme is open to all businesses, provided the business meets the requisite conditions of the scheme. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment. </p>  <p>  The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;4.9 billion and PRSI credit of almost &euro;784 million have been granted to 51,500 employers in respect of over 664,700 workers. </p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made in June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021. For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. </p>  <p>Further, as announced Tuesday 28th September, the Government has agreed that there will be no change to the EWSS for the month of October 2021, which means that the scheme will continue to operate in its current form as per the arrangements for Q3 2021. Issues around the configuration of the EWSS beyond October are currently being considered and full details will be announced on Budget Day, 12 October 2021. </p>  <p>  I would also note that the Government have put in place a range of measures to support people and businesses most affected by the financial shock of the pandemic, including the arts and cultural sector. The Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) and Tourism Business Continuity scheme have also been established in order to support those businesses most at risk. Other schemes which have been established include the Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) and the Music Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS), both of which are targeted at supporting the commercial live performance sector. Details of the supports are available on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s website at the following link: enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time. </p></reply>

EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll.  To date, &euro;4.9bn has been paid out under the scheme to 51,500 employers in respect of 664,700 employees and Employers&rsquo; PRSI of &euro;784m has been foregone.</p><p>For every qualifying employee paid a weekly gross amount between:</p><p>- &euro;151.50 and &euro;202.99, the subsidy is &euro;203,</p><p>- &euro;203 and &euro;299.99, the subsidy is &euro;250,</p><p>- &euro;300 and &euro;399.99, the subsidy is &euro;300, or</p><p>- &euro;400 and &euro;1,462, the subsidy is &euro;350. </p><p>No subsidy is available for employees paid a weekly gross amount less than &euro;151.50 or more than &euro;1,462. The scheme also provides for a reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI. </p><p>The Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021, signed into law on 19 July, provided for the extension of EWSS to 31 December 2021, ensuring that the scheme continues to provide ongoing and necessary employment support for eligible businesses as the economy returns to a full re-opening. The legislation also provided that for employers to be eligible for the EWSS, they must be able to demonstrate that their business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders for the calendar year 2021 compared to the calendar year 2019 and that this disruption to normal business is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>The EWSS legislation requires that immediately at the end of each month, from the introduction of the scheme in August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.</p><p>To assist employers in conducting a monthly review of its continuing eligibility for the scheme, Revenue is providing an <i>EWSS Eligibility Review Form</i>through its Revenue Online Service (ROS). From 21 July 2021, completing and submitting an <i>EWSS Eligibility Review Form</i>to Revenue is necessary to avail of EWSS supports, with details of an employer&rsquo;s monthly eligibility review check to be submitted by the 15<sup>th</sup>of the following month.  For example, the eligibility review undertaken on the last day of September will need to be completed and submitted to Revenue by 15 October. </p><p>In addition, employers must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance for the duration of the scheme. </p><p>I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS.  As I outlined in my recent announcement on 28 September, the Government has agreed that there will be no change to the EWSS for the month of October 2021, which means that it will continue to operate in its current form as per the arrangements for Q3 2021.

The scheme, which has to date provided &euro;2.6 billion in liquidity to approximately 95,000 businesses, applies to VAT debts, PAYE (Employer) debts, certain self-assessed income tax debts and overpayments of both the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Access to the scheme is automatic for SMEs managed by Revenue&rsquo;s Business and Personal Divisions and by agreement with larger businesses managed by Revenue&rsquo;s Large Cases and Medium Enterprise Divisions. To qualify for debt warehousing, businesses must continue to file all tax returns, even though the liability cannot be paid. </p>  <p>  For eligible businesses, Period 1, the period during which tax debts may be warehoused, has been extended to 31st December 2021, and tax debts can then be &lsquo;parked&rsquo; interest-free until 31st December 2022.  At that point the warehoused debt may be paid in full without incurring an interest charge or can be paid through a tailored phased payment arrangement starting in 2023 at a significantly reduced interest rate of 3% per annum. This compares to the standard rate of 8% or 10% per annum that would otherwise apply to such debts. Any tailored phased payment arrangement will take account of the taxpayer&rsquo;s particular financial circumstances and can be extended over a longer timeframe as required provided current liabilities continue to be paid as they fall due.</p>  <p>  I am aware that Revenue maintains regular contact with taxpayers and businesses availing of debt warehousing to ensure they appreciate the importance of continuing to file returns, to clarify any queries they may have about their obligations to repay the liabilities in due course and of the importance of paying current taxes. Revenue has assured me that it will continue to engage in this manner and that a flexible approach will be adopted to the repayment of warehoused debts on a case by case basis. Further information on the Debt Warehousing Scheme is available on the Revenue website which may be of assistance to the Deputy.</p></reply>

To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. A business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the relevant business activity during the period of restrictions will be no more than 25% of the average weekly turnover of the business in a reference period, which in most cases is 2019.</p>  <p>  With the easing of Covid restrictions in recent months many businesses are no longer significantly restricted from operating and therefore are no longer eligible for the CRSS. However, eligible businesses have been able to claim enhanced restart week payments to assist them with the costs of reopening.</p>  <p>  Where, under current public health restrictions, a business is restricted from operating, for example a nightclub, the business can, where it meets the relevant criteria, continue to claim under the CRSS until such time as it ceases to be restricted. At which time, the business can, where it meets the relevant criteria, claim an enhanced restart week payment computed at double the normal weekly CRSS rate, for three weeks, subject to a maximum weekly amount payable of &euro;5,000.</p>  <p>  Businesses that have ceased to qualify for CRSS, as well as businesses that were not eligible for CRSS, may be eligible to claim another support introduced by the Government, the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS). The BRSS is a targeted support for companies, self-employed individuals, partnerships as well as certain charities and sporting bodies that carry on a trade that was significantly impacted by Covid-19 public health restrictions, including where the impact continued after the easing of the restrictions. </p>  <p>  To qualify for the BRSS, a business must be able to demonstrate that the turnover from its trade in the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 is no more than 25% of a &lsquo;reference turnover amount&rsquo;, which is based on when the business commenced. A qualifying person may, since early September, make a claim under BRSS for a single payment which will be equal to three times the average weekly turnover of the relevant business activity in a reference period, subject to a maximum payment under the scheme of &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  Detailed operational guidelines on CRSS and BRSS are available on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that, on 15 September, the D&aacute;il approved the draft Statutory Instrument to extend the CRSS to 31 December 2021. I can confirm that I have since signed the S.I. and the CRSS will run to 31 December 2021.</p></reply>

The scheme ended on 30 April.  </p>  <p>  Since 1 October 2020, a total of 67,982 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 29 September 2021. The related expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;11,359,603, and the potential tax cost is &euro;2,271,921, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme. </p>  <p>  The scheme was developed at a time last year when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted. Unfortunately, this turned out not to be the case and, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.</p>  <p>  I do not have any plans to re-introduce the scheme.</p>  <p>  However, in recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9% from 1 November 2020. This was originally to apply until 31 December 2021. However, the reduced rate was extended to 31 August 2022. The extension until the end of the 2022 summer season allows for a longer period of recovery for the sector. It should be noted that this VAT rate reduction came after the introduction of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit and reflects the fact that the latter was not intended to be the sole sector-specific support for hospitality.</p></reply>

These include properties purchased as a home during 2013, properties in unfinished housing estates, unsold properties held by builders or developers and new or unused properties purchased from a builder or developer. The current exemption in respect of pyrite damaged properties is being phased out and will not apply after 21 July 2023. However, any properties that qualify for the exemption up to that date will benefit for the full six-year period from the next valuation date (i.e. from the following 1 November). </p><p>While the current &lsquo;pyrite exemption&rsquo; is being phased out, the legislation provides for an exemption from LPT for a period of six years for homes whose owners are eligible for the defective concrete blocks scheme.  Also, owners of properties that are unoccupied due to extended periods of illness can apply for an exemption for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; if their property is occupied by a person who is not a joint owner, such as a tenant, relative or friend. The full list of exemptions that apply for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; are listed on the Revenue website.</p><p>Finally, the option to defer LPT liabilities remains in place for the new &lsquo;valuation period&rsquo; where certain conditions are met. The rate of interest applicable to deferrals has been reduced from 4% per annum to 3% per annum from 1 January 2022, while the qualifying income thresholds are increased to &euro;18,000 (from &euro;15,000) for a single owner and &euro;30,000 for a couple (from &euro;25,000).

In the Finance Act 2016 the Levy was extended until 2021. That extension had been subject to a review being undertaken of the methodology used to calculate the levy, which included a public consultation with stakeholders in June 2016. That stakeholder exercise was inconclusive in terms of getting external agreement on a possible replacement to the DIRT-based methodology. </p>  <p>  Ultimately the DIRT-based formula was retained but the then Minister for Finance took into account the suggestion that arose from the Public Consultation that the base year for calculating Levy liability should not be static, and announced in Budget 2017 the introduction of a rolling two-year series of base years. </p>  <p>  In order to protect the annual &euro;150 million yield based on the financial institutions' DIRT liability, the rate payable has increased from 35% in 2014 to 308% for 2021.</p>  <p>  The Bank Levy is due to cease in 2021. I am currently considering whether to extend the levy beyond 2021, and if so the format it will take. In making my decision on this matter, the Deputy should note that I will be giving consideration to the significant changes taking place in the Irish banking sector, including the planned withdrawal of two retail banks from the market.</p>  <p>   Finally you should note that the Levy applies to certain financial institutions operating in the State that are liable to pay DIRT. The names of those financial institutions, however, and the amounts paid by each one, is confidential taxpayer information in accordance with section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. </p></reply>

There is no separate taxation regime specifically for ETFs.  Being collective investment funds, they generally come within the regimes set out in the TCA 1997 for such funds. </p>  <p>  The normal tax treatment afforded to Irish collective investment funds is that the funds invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund.  The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice. Most OECD countries have a tax system that provides for neutrality between direct investments and investments through a Collective Investment Vehicle/Fund.</p>  <p>  Funds are obliged to operate an exit tax regime and remit the tax deducted in this manner to Revenue.  This ensures that appropriate tax is collected from Irish investors. This charge to tax does not apply in the case of unit holders who are non-resident. In the case of non-resident investors&rsquo;, liability to tax on gains from the fund will be determined in their home jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  There is a charge to tax on Irish residents on the happening of a &ldquo;chargeable event&rdquo;. In order to prevent the indefinite deferral of a chargeable event (and therefore an exit charge), a deemed disposal occurs 8 years following inception of a policy of life assurance or acquisition of a fund and then every 8 years thereafter.</p>  <p>  Any gain on the investment which arises from the date of inception or acquisition to the date of the deemed disposal is subject to tax. This ensures that income isn&rsquo;t rolled up indefinitely in funds or life assurance policies without being subject to tax. On the ultimate disposal of the investment, any tax paid which arose as a result of a deemed disposal is allowed as a credit against any final tax liability on disposal.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to conduct a review the 8 year deemed disposal rule.</p></reply>

Farmers may elect to register for VAT or be treated as flat-rate farmers for VAT purposes. Farmers that are registered for VAT have an entitlement to reclaim VAT charged on costs incurred in relation to the farm business, including VAT borne on the purchase of agricultural equipment and non-oral animal medicines. Farmers that are not registered for VAT are compensated for the VAT incurred on goods and services used in the course of their farming business, through the flat rate addition they receive on payments for their supplies of agricultural produce and services.  </p>  <p>  In accordance with Irish VAT legislation, slurry-spreading equipment is liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%, and there is no discretion, under the Directive, to reduce this VAT rate as suggested by the Deputy. The supply of non-oral animal medicines is subject to the standard rate of VAT, currently 23%, but it is not possible, under the Directive, to exempt the supply of these goods as suggested by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that the information provided on tax returns does not require the VAT charged or paid on individual products or activities to be separately identified. Therefore, the amount of VAT paid (or refunded) in relation to any specific product or activity, or the cost of exempting specific products or activities from VAT is not separately available. Furthermore, the measure to allow for accelerated capital allowances for the purchase of farm safety equipment was only introduced in 2021 for which income tax returns are not due until late 2022.</p>  <p>  Revenue inform me that the number of live VAT registrations in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector is 12,700. This does not include taxpayers involved in the farming sector who may be classified under a different sector due to engaging in other activities in addition to farming.  As set out in Revenue&rsquo;s farming statistics reports, available at  www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/research/farming-profile-2020.pdf, these VAT registered cases form a small proportion of the total of some 148,000 farmers registered with Revenue for tax purposes.  </p></reply>

It is legislated for in Section 81AA on the Stamp Duties Consolidation Acts 1999 (SDCA 1999), titled &ldquo;Transfers to young trained farmers&rdquo;,</p><p>As with all such reliefs, it is subject to a number of terms and conditions. Section 81AA was introduced in Finance Act 2000, has since been extended on a number of occasions, and is currently due to expire on 31 December 2021. </p><p>The primary domestic and EU policy objective of this relief is to encourage the inter-generational transfers of agricultural land, with a secondary purpose being to increase the level and rate of adoption of new more productive and more environmentally friendly farming practices.</p><p>I expect to announce my plans for the future of this relief as part of Budget 2022, which I will be presenting on October 12th this year.</p><p>In respect of age limits, I am assuming the Deputy is again referring to the young trained farmer stamp duty relief.  Section 81AA SDCA 1999) states in subsection (1) a &ldquo;<i>youngtrained farmer</i>&rdquo; is defined (in part) as being a &ldquo;<i>person who has not attained the age of 35 years on the date onwhich the instrument, in respect of which the relief is being claimedunder this section, was executed...</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>It is the view of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that the age limit of 35 is appropriate, and should be retained. I support this view. This view is taken on the basis that, in order to seek to address the problems with the age profile of Irish farmers,  35 years of age as the cut-off point for availing of tax reliefs rather than a later age,  is more likely to  boost the incentive to, and benefit from age capped reliefs such as this one. Any increase in the age limit for this relief would only serve to reduce its intended effectiveness in this regard. </p><p>In regards to the state aid limit, Sections 21 and 48 of the Finance Act 2018 articulate the EU state aid related &euro;70,000 lifetime limit that any one farmer can receive cumulatively under three farming related tax reliefs:</p><p>- the Young Trained Farmer stamp duty relief, </p><p>- the stock relief for young trained farmers and </p><p>- the succession farm partnerships tax credit. </p><p>This is in accordance with Article 18 of EU Regulation 702/2014.  The reason that this limit was put in the Finance Act in 2018 was to provide clarity on these rules, which had existed since 2014.  </p><p>As this limit is linked to an EU regulation, it is not possible to change it unilaterally. I do however understand that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Mr. Charlie McConalogue T.D. has been seeking to have this issue addressed as part of the ongoing renegotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p><p>To conclude, one of the conditions for availing of the Young Trained Farmer stamp duty relief is that an applicant must submit a business plan to Teagasc.</p><p>The submission of a business plan is a requirement under the EU state aid rules, and the Young Trained Farmer relief would not qualify as a permitted state aid under the ABER (Agricultural Block Exemption Regulation) without such a plan being required .</p><p>The IFA have proposed that it should be permissible for a business plan to be submitted up to 12 months after the relief is claimed. Allowing the submission of a business plan after an applicant had enjoyed the benefits of the relief, even with the introduction of the potential for a Revenue clawback in circumstances where a business plan was not supplied, is likely to  weaken the relief&rsquo;s case for being deemed a permissible state aid, and to be administratively burdensome. </p><p>I therefore have no plans to make a change of the type sought by the IFA. </p></reply>

As a result a technical note was prepared and sent to the  Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 23 December 2020. This note provides a good overview of the issue. </p>  <p>  For the purpose of this response you should note that Sections 598 and 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provide relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of a qualifying business or farming assets where the person disposing of the asset(s) is aged 55 or over and both owned and used the assets for the ten years prior to the disposal. For the purposes of the relief, qualifying assets include land and other assets used for farming purposes. </p>  <p>  In relation to farming assets, the legislation requires that, in order to qualify for the relief, the individual must own and use the assets for the purposes of farming in the ten-year period ending on the disposal.  If the individual does not meet the ten-year requirement as set out in the legislation, both in respect of their ownership of, and use of, these assets, the relief from capital gains tax under section 598 and/or section 599 is not available to that individual.  </p>  <p>  As explained in the technical note to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach,  I am of the view that there is no basis for changing the existing position as such an amendment could effectively double the relief available to a couple even in cases where one spouse had never used the asset (e.g. worked on the farm), thus undermining the integrity of the relief.  Consequently,  I could not support such a change. </p></reply>

The standard rate of stamp duty applying to the transfer of agricultural land is 7.5%.<b></b></p><p>In line with Government policy, it is intended to both encourage and facilitate intergenerational farm transfers.  </p><p>The consanguinity stamp duty relief (as set out in Schedule 1 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999) was last extended in section 53 of Finance Act 2020. It is next due to expire at the end of 2023. </p><p>It is my view that extending such tax reliefs in three year increments provides an appropriate balance between delivering a degree of medium-term certainty in respect of the availability of a relief for those planning to avail of it, as well as for those operating it, and the need for the relief to be reviewed regularly by my Department (with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine). These regular reviews help ensure that the reliefs remain fit-for-purpose, reflect current government policy, continue to be consistent with EU state aid policy, and to allow for other considerations. </p><p>On that basis, a decision of the further extension of the consanguinity relief is expected to be taken in advance of Budget 2024/Finance Bill 2023. </p></reply>

The beneficiary must also be an active farmer or lease the land to one. Agricultural Relief has been available for gift and inheritance tax since the introduction of Capital Acquisitions Tax in 1976. </p>  <p>  I believe Agricultural Relief is a vital measure to ensure the ongoing viability of family farms that pass from one generation to another and any reduction in scale of relief could have a negative impact on the development and growth of farming businesses. I also believe it is a fair and valuable relief to the beneficiaries. I have no plans to adjust Agricultural Relief at this time.</p></reply>

This means that they are entitled to the Group A tax-free threshold of &euro;335,000.</p>  <p>  The aim of this relief is to target a nephew/niece who worked for the aunt/uncle over a 5-year period prior to inheritance for a minimum number of hours per week, putting their labour and expertise at the disposal of the aunt/uncle and making a sustained contribution to the business before inheritance.</p>  <p>  When combined with CAT Agricultural Relief, this relief is intended to support the intergenerational transfer of a family farm and is particularly important in circumstances where a farmer may not have had a direct descendant (e.g. child) to whom they may bequeath the family farm.</p>  <p>  I believe that extending the relief to allow for the nomination of a &lsquo;Favourite Successor Relief&rsquo; would represent a significant departure from the current CAT regime, as well as a departure from the policy rationale of the Favourite Nephew/Niece Relief.</p>  <p>  This would most likely be followed by pressure to extend this to other reliefs (e.g. business), or more broadly for disponers to seek to nominate a &lsquo;Favourite Successor&rsquo; for their estate.</p>  <p>  Such a fundamental departure from the current CAT regime would lead to an erosion of the revenue base.

To qualify for the relief, the person taking the gift or inheritance (the &ldquo;beneficiary&rdquo;) of the agricultural property must first qualify as a &ldquo;farmer&rdquo;, as defined in section 89 CATCA 2003.  </p><p>The definition of farmer in the legislation requires that at least 80% of the gross market value of the property to which a person is beneficially entitled in possession consists of agricultural property.  In addition, following an amendment made to section 89 by Finance Act 2014, the beneficiary (or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land) must actively farm the agricultural land on a commercial basis for at least half of his or her normal working time for a period of at least 6 years after receiving the gift or inheritance. Failure to actively farm all (or part) of the agricultural land during the 6-year qualifying period will result in a full (or partial) clawback of the relief.  </p><p>The &lsquo;active farmer&rsquo; requirement was introduced in 2014 to ensure that agricultural relief was, and is, more effectively targeted at individuals that inherit or are gifted agricultural property and actively farm it themselves on a commercial basis (or lease it on a long-term basis to active farmers), thereby ensuring the productive use of agricultural property.  The requirement to actively farm the land is, therefore, already a fundamental requirement to qualify for, and to retain, agricultural relief. </p><p>As with most taxes, capital acquisitions tax operates on a self-assessment basis, subject to Revenue compliance checks and audit. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, where Revenue identifies arrangements that are not in accordance with the relevant legislative requirements to qualify for a relief, it takes appropriate corrective action. </p><p>Revenue has published on its website detailed guidance on the operation of agricultural relief, which is available at:<i></i>www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/capital-acquisitions-tax/cat-part11.pdf</p></reply>

The use of a partnership model, rather than an upfront outright sale, allows for the transfer of knowledge from the older farmer to the younger farmer in advance of the transfer of ownership of the land. </p><p>The primary participant in a registered farm partnership should apply to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter the partnership on the register of succession farm partnerships.  To be entered on the register of succession farm partnerships, a registered farm partnership must comply with certain conditions.  </p><p>Firstly, in relation to the estimated cost of extending the succession tax credit to off-farm income, I am advised by Revenue that this tax credit may already be offset against a taxpayer&rsquo;s overall tax liability.  </p><p>Further, I am advised by Revenue that the annual costs of the tax credit for succession farm partnerships are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/tax-expenditures/costs-tax-expenditures.pdf. The tax credit came into operation in 2017 and the latest year for which data are available is 2018.</p><p>The following table sets out the numbers of participants and the associated Exchequer cost for 2018 and 2017: <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2017</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No. of   participants</td>       <td>290</td>       <td>175</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cost (&euro;m)</td>       <td>0.6</td>       <td>0.4</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Finally, one of the conditions of the scheme is that the farmer must enter into an agreement to transfer at least 80% of the farm assets to which the farm partnership applies to the successor (or successors) at some point in the period beginning 3 years after and ending 10 years from the date on which the application to enter the partnership on the register is made.  The terms of the agreement must include the farm assets of the farm partnership on the day the application is made, the year in which the proposed transfer will take place, any conditions to which the transfer or sale will be subject, and any other terms agreed between the farmer and the successor (or successors). </p><p>For the year of assessment in which the partnership is registered as a succession farm partnership and the four years of assessment immediately following that, each partner will be entitled to a succession tax credit of the lesser amount of:  </p><p>- &euro;5,000 per year of assessment divided between the partners in accordance with their profit-sharing ratio, and </p><p>- the assessable profits arising to the partner from the succession farm partnership. </p></reply>

The Directive aims at ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market and, at the same time, seeks to promote a high level of health protection and to fight against tax fraud, tax evasion and illegal cross border shopping.</p>  <p>  The upcoming review of the EU Directive is set to include a revision of EU minima taxation rates, the introduction of harmonised taxation rates, legislation on cross-border purchasing and product regulation, among other issues. The Department has so far engaged with preliminary work undertaken on behalf of the European Commission, regarding minimum rates and harmonised tax regimes for novel products. It is likely that work on updating the EU Directive will begin in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Domestically, the Programme for Government outlined plans to introduce a targeted taxation regime to specifically discourage &lsquo;vaping&rsquo; and e-cigarettes. The Healthy Ireland Strategic Plan 2021-2025 also cites the exploration of taxation regimes in relation to novel tobacco products and electronic cigarettes as part of the revision of the EU Tobacco Products Directive as an implementation action. Both the Department of Finance and the Department of Health are of the view that tax policy in relation to novel products such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products may be best addressed in the context of the revision to the Tobacco Products Tax EU Directive.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-05a.575.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100500064#WRK00700"><p>I am assured by Revenue that combating the threat which illegal cross&ndash;border trade and smuggling of all kinds, including that in fuel products, poses to legitimate businesses, consumers and the Exchequer continues to be a priority. Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against illegal cross-border trade, and also cooperate with their counterparts in Northern Ireland under the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force.</p>  <p>  Steps taken by Revenue to combat the illegal mineral oils trade, including home heating oils, include the introduction of stringent supply chain controls and reporting requirements, a rigorous programme of risk focused enforcement action and the application of robust legislation. In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation in April 2015. The industry view is that the actions taken have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud. </p>  <p>  Solid Fuel Carbon Tax (SFCT) is an excise duty that applies to coal and peat when first supplied in the State for use as a fuel. Neither the movement of solid fuel into the State nor the physical presence of solid fuel in the State generate a liability to SFCT. Therefore, there is no smuggling offence, in terms of evasion of SFCT, attaching to coal coming into the State from Northern Ireland. Solid fuel carbon tax is collected by Revenue on a self-assessment basis and compliance with the law is enforced using the full range of compliance interventions and enforcement provisions for self-assessed taxes. </p>  <p>  Currently, there is no carbon tax on solid fuel in Northern Ireland. This factor, combined with that jurisdiction's lower VAT rate on solid fuel, lower environmental standards and currency fluctuations, can give rise to significant price differentials which incentivises the sourcing of solid fuel from Northern Ireland. EU Single Market constraints, which still apply in Northern Ireland, preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of SFCT. This means that solid fuel coming into the State from Northern Ireland is not subject to cross-border movement controls typical of harmonised excises on mineral oils, tobacco and alcohol. I am advised that Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of solid fuel. Similarly, Revenue has no authority to challenge transportation or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland as such transportation or possession are not, in themselves, Revenue offences. Even if controls were possible, a person transporting solid fuel from Northern Ireland could legitimately claim that SFCT will be accounted for on relevant supplies made in the State. An SFCT return does not have to be made until one month after the end of the two-month accounting period in which the supply is made.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy refers to enforcement proceedings for years 2018 to 2021 to date which I presume are in relation to the enforcement of environmental standards on solid fuel; and also refers to new regulations which I presume are the regulations restricting the use of smoky fuel.  I am advised that Revenue does not have a role in relation to these matters. They come, instead, under the ambit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and are enforced through the local authorities.  The Deputy may wish to refer this aspect of his query to my colleague the Minster for the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></reply>

In this context, Officials in my Department have been working with, and continue to work with employers across the Civil and Public Service to develop a Blended Working Policy Framework for the Civil Service. This Framework focuses on the longer-term approach to remote working in the sector and can assist in providing a consistent approach across the wider public sector.  The primary Principle set out in the Framework is that blended working must support the business needs of the Organisation.  Blended working presents an opportunity to meet business needs in a new way of working; to enhance service delivery; underpin business continuity; and improve the performance of organisations, provided the role being performed is suitable to be carried out remotely.  </p>  <p>  The Framework will be finalised over the coming weeks, following engagement with employee representatives which is currently underway. When this engagement has concluded and the Framework is agreed, it will be rolled out to all civil service organisations. The Framework will provide consistency on certain issues and inform the development of organisational blended working policies which will be tailored to meet the specific requirements of each Department/Office.</p></reply>

The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1st March 2021. By the closing date, over 3,100 applications were submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding. This is the highest number of applications ever received. </p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were published earlier this year and all applications are being assessed accordingly. Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on the 6th August. The remaining applications for capital works are now being assessed with allocations expected to be announced before the end of this year. Every effort will be made to fund as many worthwhile projects as possible while providing a sufficient level of grant to ensure the projects are viable.</p>  <p>  As to whether previously awarded grants could be increased, it is important to note that grants awarded under the SCEP are intended to be a contribution towards the overall cost of a project, rather than the full cost of the project, and it is a requirement that all grantees have sufficient of their own resources to complete a project. If there is a difficulty with completing a project, my Department is always available to engage with grantees who wish to scale back a project or to facilitate a "change of purpose" for an older grant. Consideration can also be given to completing projects on a phased basis whereby subsequent parts of an overall development project can be the subject of future grant applications. Any grantees who wish to pursue such an option should contact the Sports Capital Division of my Department in the first instance.</p></reply>

I recognise the essential role that local media organisations play in this regard and in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.</p>  <p>  The local media sector faces a fall in revenue arising from the pandemic, but also longer term challenges as a result of changing patterns of media consumption, technology and shifts in advertising revenue. I fully recognise the essential role that the local media plays and the particular value of local and regional newspapers, as well as local, regional and community radio stations, in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.</p>  <p>  Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have met key stakeholders including NewsBrands, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).  In relation to the local radio sector, I have received quarterly reports from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, analysing how COVID-19 has affected Independent Radio.  My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders in order to explore the issues arising and build an understanding of the range of challenges facing the sector.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local media organisations, such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.  Moreover, I understand that at least &euro;4.4 million was expended on regional and local print advertising from March 2020 to April 2021, and Government and HSE COVID-related advertising spend also produced a source of revenue for radio stations which amounted to &euro;1.8m in Q1 2021. </p>  <p>  I also secured additional funding for the Sound and Vision scheme alongside the allocation of 7% of net licence fee receipts which normally supports the fund.  I allocated an additional &euro;4.9m to the BAI in December 2020, and in May 2021, the BAI announced the allocation of &euro;7.2m in supports which will facilitate the production of 104 projects. A further round of &euro;2.58m was awarded on 29 April to support all 32 radio stations in the independent radio sector. Further Sound and Vision funding rounds will follow later in year and the BAI, will announce these as they arise.</p>  <p>  In recognition of these longer term challenges facing the sector, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion.  The Future of Media Commission conducted a public consultation, that resulted in over 800 written submissions from stakeholder groups, including local media.  In addition, the Commission conducted a number of online dialogues with stakeholders and experts CRAOL, IBI, the NUJ, Local Ireland, and NewsBrands. </p>  <p>  The work of the Future of Media Commission has now been completed. The Taoiseach and I have received the report and are considering its contents and the Report will be brought to Government for consideration in due course.</p></reply>

Its core proposition is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement. The Programme seeks to support each citizen - whether individually or collectively, in our personal lives or in our institutions - to realise our full creative potential, by encouraging, facilitating and supporting collaboration. </p><p>To this end, and under the guiding principles of creativity, collaboration and transformation, the Programme has sought to:</p><p>- promote understanding and appreciation of the value of creativity in all its forms; </p><p>- engage and influence decision-makers to embed creativity across public policy; and </p><p>- support and enable participation in creative industries.</p><p>The Programme is based around five pillars</p><p>I. Enabling the Creative Potential of Every Child</p><p>II. Enabling Creativity in every Community</p><p>III. Investing in our Creative and Cultural Infrastructure</p><p>IV. Ireland as a Centre of Excellence in Audiovisual Production </p><p>V. Unifying our Global Reputation.</p><p>Through the Creative Ireland Programme, my Department has worked in partnership with various Departments and agencies to deliver significant progress in each individual pillar. Investments have focused on supporting both direct engagement with creativity &ndash; such as in schools, local communities, industry &ndash; as well as deploying creativity as a way of engaging with broader societal issues &ndash; such as health and wellbeing, social marginalisation, isolation, intercultural dialogue, climate action and biodiversity loss.</p><p>My Department has been actively engaging with officials across a number of Government Departments as it reflects on the Programme's strategic direction, potential opportunities to deepen collaboration, and possible future priorities.  Acknowledging the all-of-Government nature of the Programme, it is my intention to bring proposals to Government shortly which will set out the progress of the Programme to date and include a consideration of the Programme's future beyond 2022.</p></reply>

Sport Ireland will shortly arrange for the invitation of applications from NGBs and sports clubs with the aim of distributing this funding.   In addition to these financial supports, which benefit young and old alike, I consider that a public information campaign emphasising the benefits of sport can also contribute to a comprehensive resumption to sporting activity. Sport Ireland started such a campaign yesterday under the title of &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Get Back&rdquo;. The campaign will run for the next five weeks and is aimed at encouraging members of the public that are anxious or unsure about returning to sport and physical activity that it is possible to do so in a safe and secure manner.  The campaign will also collaborate with social media influencers and platforms to promote the message to the younger demographic.  </p>  <p>  The campaign will form the opening part of a wider winter initiative to get people back to sport and increase participation, with activities planned throughout the sports sector up to March 2022. The campaign will provide National Governing Bodies with a perfect platform to launch their Autumn and Winter Programmes. </p>  <p>  While the pace and extent of the return to sport for all people, is significantly dependent on the capacity of the various sporting organisations and clubs at local level, I hope that these measures will help support organisations and clubs in bringing as many people, including young people, back to sporting activity as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

I have personally met with numerous representative organisations and officials in my Department have continued contact with these organisations and others on a regular basis throughout the pandemic, to confirm that I had the most up-to-date information to ensure appropriate supports were delivered for the sector. This includes stakeholder forums in August and September where I spoke directly to a wide range of stakeholders and heard their concerns. </p><p>In relation to the Basic Income Guarantee pilot, the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce report <i>Life Worth Living</i>, was published in November 2020 and made ten recommendations for the sector. These recommendations included a proposal to pilot a basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audio-visual and live performance and events sectors. I believe the delivery of this pilot will be key to underpinning the recovery in the arts and culture sector and will provide much needed certainty to the artists and creatives who choose to avail of the pilot scheme.</p><p>The <i>Life Worth Living</i>report describes a basic income as an unconditional state payment that each citizen receives, in this instance, for the arts and cultural sector. The introduction of such a basic income pilot would create a more stable social protection mechanism to allow artists and workers to sustain themselves during the pandemic. It should keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits: social and economic, local and national. </p><p>I fully agree that the arts sector represents a very appropriate area for a Basic Income Guarantee scheme for many reasons, including that:</p><p>- it is often characterised by low and precarious income; </p><p>- it includes a broad mix of employment types and;</p><p>- it has been chosen for Basic Income pilots in other jurisdictions allowing for international comparisons to be drawn e.g. Finland, Germany, Canada and France.</p><p>I was delighted that as part of the <i>National Economic Recovery Plan</i>, I secured a commitment from Government to prioritise the development of a Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme for the arts and cultural sector. As Minister with responsibility for Arts and Culture, I am conscious of the value that this sector brings to all Irish citizens, which was particularly evident during the pandemic. The importance of Irish culture, Irish art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be understated in terms of its impact both internationally and at home. The Government recognises that bold steps are necessary for our much treasured arts, events and cultural community to come back stronger than ever before. </p><p>I established an Oversight Group in June of this year to appraise the recommendations in the <i>Life Worth Living </i>report. Although the remit of the Oversight Group included the examination of all recommendations in the report, I asked that they prioritise the consideration of the Recommendation on a basic income guarantee pilot scheme for artists and arts workers as a priority. The Oversight Group is chaired by my Department and joined by representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members alongside a representative of the County and City Managers Association.</p><p>The Oversight Group has met 8 times over the last 4 months to discuss the Basic Income recommendation alongside the other 9 recommendations. To assist in these discussions, the Oversight Group established a subcommittee to focus solely on the progression of the recommendation for the basic income Pilot Scheme. This sub-committee met 9 times over the summer months to develop a number of options that could fulfil the requirements of a pilot scheme as set out in the <i>Life Worth Living</i>report.  The Oversight Group, with the research carried out by this sub-committee, has provided me with a preliminary report on the different options for a 3 year pilot scheme which I am currently considering.  </p><p>A number of organisations have given presentations to the Oversight Committee in order to inform their considerations these include:</p><p>- the NCFA (the National Campaign for the Arts)</p><p>- Social Justice Ireland</p><p>- Praxis &ndash; the Artists Union</p><p>- Dr Stephen Kinsella &ndash; Economist in University Limerick and Niamh NicGhabhann &amp;amp; Annmarie Ryan who had done research in the area of artist basic income</p><p>In addition, Equity the actors union are due to present to the group next week.</p><p>The objectives of the pilot scheme will include:</p><p>- To minimise the ongoing loss of skills in the arts sector, both artists and arts workers;</p><p>- Contributing to the sectors recovery post-pandemic, with ongoing benefits: social and economic, local and national;</p><p>- Enabling artists to focus on their practice without having to enter into employment in other sectors to sustain themselves;</p><p>I believe it is particularly important for this pilot scheme to also address the wellbeing of those in the arts and cultural sector, and to stimulate the arts sector&rsquo;s recovery post-pandemic.</p><p>I will be providing further detail on how this pilot scheme will operate in the near future as part of the discussions around Budget 2022. Significant stakeholder engagement will take place in the coming weeks between my Department and those in the Sector to ensure that this pilot meets the needs of the sector alongside the objectives agreed by the Oversight Group. </p><p>I envision that this pilot should launch in early 2022 and I believe it will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector, after the difficult circumstances they have endured over the last year and a half. </p></reply>

The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1st March 2021. By the closing date, over 3,100 applications were submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding. This is the highest number of applications ever received.  </p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were published earlier this year and all applications are being assessed accordingly. Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on the 6th August. </p>  <p>  The remaining 2,000 approx. applications for capital works are now being assessed. Given the large number of applications received, this work is likely to take a number of months to   complete with allocations expected to be announced before the end of this year. A decision on the total allocation amount will not be made until all applications have been assessed.</p>  <p>  It is not possible at this stage to state what this level of funding will be as factors such as the level of invalid applications will be relevant. Furthermore, the level of carry-over from this year into 2022 will be dependent on the level of drawdown demands received in the Department before the end of this year.  Every effort will be made to fund as many worthwhile projects as possible while providing a sufficient level of grant to ensure the projects are viable.</p></reply>

Last year a Tourism Recovery Taskforce was put in place to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish Tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis.  The Taskforce, in drawing up its plan, undertook a comprehensive analysis of what was required to help the sector to survive and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. This plan has been more than useful for both my cabinet colleagues and myself in considering measures that can assist the sector. </p><p>Measures taken by Government, such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme, together with the sector-specific measures for tourism that I have introduced such as business continuity grants and the lower VAT rate have all been critical in supporting businesses and jobs over the past 18 months.</p><p>Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism and hospitality sector, with up to two-thirds of businesses reporting reduced capacity due to staff shortages. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been collaborating with industry to help address this issue and have launched <i>#BeThePulse</i>, a new recruitment marketing and awareness campaign to help attract new staff to the industry. F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to promote opportunities and communicate the benefits of working in the industry via their content and social media strategy on tourismcareers.ie.</p><p>I appointed a Recovery Oversight Group to oversee the implementation of the Tourism Recovery Plan and they report to me on a regular basis with updates on implementation and the recovery of the sector. This group has recently submitted its third report to me. I will use the report from the Recovery Oversight Group as an important policy consideration as I continue to work, alongside my Government colleagues, to support the tourism sector over the coming year and beyond. I will consider further initiatives to support tourism in the context of Budget 2022.</p><p>The global health crisis has had a devastating impact on our tourism sector but it has also provided an opportunity now to address sustainable tourism development in a more meaningful way during the recovery and rebuilding phase following this crisis. In line with our Programme for Government commitments, officials within my Department are taking initial steps towards the development of a new national tourism policy which will mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will be informed by the Guiding Principles for Sustainable Tourism Development developed by the Sustainable Tourism Working Group and will be consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments. </p><p>It is clear that the traditional model of tourism is changing and the development of this new national tourism policy gives us an opportunity to set out what type of tourism sector we want to 2030 and beyond. Tourism has proven itself resilient before and I am confident that, with the support of Government, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again in a manner which is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.</p></reply>

The scheme is designed for projects where the grant being sought is greater than the maximum grant available under the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP). The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and thus far, approximately &euro;86.4m has been awarded to 33 different proposals.</p>  <p>  All applications under the LSSIF were assessed in accordance with the published scoring criteria. The total funding applied for under the scheme significantly exceeded the amount available to allocate and so it was not possible to make provisional allocations to many worthwhile projects.</p>  <p>  While the priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects, as it is now over 18 months since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants. My Department is engaging with all grantees in this regard. The scope for awarding new grants to projects which missed out under the first set of allocations is being considered as part of this review as is the timing of any new call for proposals. It is expected that the review will be completed in the coming months.</p></reply>

Ireland's strong global reputation for creativity brings many benefits to our country including the encouraging of visitors for tourism, education and business, providing compelling reasons to visit Ireland and experience Irish creativity first hand. </p>  <p>  Culture Ireland has the primary responsibility for the promotion of Irish arts and artists globally.  Through its Grants Programme and Annual Funding Programme, Culture Ireland works to bring Irish artists to audiences worldwide. While much of this activity was online over the past 18 moths, I am delighted to be able to approve support for Irish artists to travel globally again. Representatives of Tourism Ireland, The Arts Council, Screen Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs sit on the Expert Advisory Committee of Culture Ireland and this cross agency representation ensures that there is a joined up approach to achieve the aims of Global Ireland 2025 through the promotion of Irish artists globally.</p>  <p>  While I have recently returned from visits to Britain and the US promoting the "Green Button" campaign which aims to highlight all of the benefits Ireland has to offer to visitors whether for culture, leisure or business purpose, the tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, have operational responsibility for tourism promotion. I have asked both tourism agencies to respond directly to the Deputy with further information on how they leverage Irish culture for tourism promotional purposes &ndash; domestically in the case of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and overseas in the case of Tourism Ireland.

As part of the framework, the Commissioner will devise binding online safety codes that will set out how regulated online services, including certain social media services, are expected to deal with certain defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms. The defined categories of harmful online content include criminal material, serious cyber-bullying material and material promoting self-harm, suicide and eating disorders.</p>  <p>  Under the measures proposed in the Bill, in the event of a failure to comply with a relevant online safety code, and subject to Court approval, the Media Commission will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services, including through financial sanctions of up to &euro;20m or 10% of turnover.</p>  <p>  Given the importance of this legislation, in December 2020 I asked the Government to approve the commencement of detailed drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Attorney General and the referral of the General Scheme the Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny simultaneously.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-05a.733.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100500066#WRM01500"><p>As I have previously outlined to the House, I am aware of the potential disruption to the livelihood of the Fisheries sector as a result of Off-Shore Renewal Energy (ORE) developments and the designation of Marine Protected Areas. Specifically in relation to ORE, the issue of diverse levels and standards of communications between the fisheries and ORE industries was first raised by members of the fisheries community at a National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) public consultation meeting in Arklow held on 10/02/2020, which was one of a number of NMPF public consultation events held by my Department officials in the Marine Planning Policy and Legislation team across 2019 and early 2020.</p><p>Directly in response to those concerns, and also with the wider aim of promoting constructive engagement and consultation between the fisheries community and the ORE industry, I then instructed my Department officials to commence the formation of a Seafood/ORE working group, with the initial aim of agreeing a communications protocol between these two strategically important Marine sectors. During the last months of 2020, and at regular intervals throughout this year, constructive discussions and consultations on the draft terms of reference have been held between my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and other relevant public sector bodies. Advice on International best practice has also been sought from, and consulted on, with neighbouring Maritime jurisdictions with experience in Fisheries/ORE Industry liaison.  As a critical part of these engagements, officials from all three Departments participated in a Seafood sector information session, held online on July 22nd, in order to inform the Seafood sector of the intentions of the three Departments with regard to the Seafood/ORE working group. This information session was attended by the majority of the Irish Seafood sector organisations.</p><p>I acknowledge that the commencement of the Seafood/ORE working group has been delayed due to a number of factors, including Covid-related restrictions, the prioritisation of the finalisation process of the NMPF, and progression of the Maritime Area Planning Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas, among other issues. My Department, working with the other two Departments involved in this group, are currently engaged in the process of identifying and appointing a Chairperson for the working group, and I will make an announcement on that in due course once that process is completed. </p><p>With regard to the issue of compensation, or a compensatory body, I wish to make clear that the initial focus of the working group will be on the aforementioned communications protocol. However, it is the intention of my Department that the Seafood/ORE group will, in time, address other issues affecting the Fisheries community, such as dislocation, co-existence, the impact of developments (including exploration of development sites), Safety at Sea.</p><p>The issue of compensation was something noted by my Department during the public consultation on the NMPF, as this was raised in submissions by several fisheries organisations. My Department has not yet formulated a definitive position, but is giving further consideration to the points raised in those public submissions as the NMPF moves toward the Implementation stages. Given their functional remit over fisheries and offshore renewables policy respectively, I intend to further consult with my colleagues the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications on this issue. </p><p>In recent correspondence to my Department, the National Inshore Fisheries Association and the National Inshore Fisheries Organisation jointly suggested the potential appointment of an independent arbitrator to address potential compensation issues. In this regard, my Department, and the other Departments involved, will be informed by the reports and suggested outcomes of the Seafood/ORE working group, and will consider this, and any other compensation-related proposal in further detail should the group propose similar. However, I do not wish to pre-empt the outcomes of any discussions that may take place within the confines of the working group. </p><p>Notwithstanding the commencement of the aforementioned group, and any formal consultation or engagement guidelines that may be subsequently developed by that group, my Department has worked across Government and with marine stakeholders to ensure the interests and rights of the fisheries community are clearly stated and represented in the Fisheries policy approach of the NMPF, in a way that complements other areas of fisheries management. In that regard, NMPF Fisheries Policy 1 states that;</p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Proposals that may have significant adverse impacts on access for existing fishing activities, must demonstrate that they will, in order of preference: a) avoid, b) minimise, or c) mitigate such impacts. If it is not possible to mitigate significant adverse impacts on fishing activity, the public benefits for proceeding with the proposal that outweigh the significant adverse impacts on existing activities must be demonstrated.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p><p>While Fisheries Policy 2 states;  </p><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Where significant impact upon fishing activity arising from any proposal is identified, a Fisheries Management and Mitigation Strategy (FMMS) should be prepared by the proposer of development or other maritime area use, in consultation with local fishing interests and other interests as appropriate. All efforts should be made to agree the FMMS with those interests. Those interests should also undertake to engage with the proposer and provide best available, transparent and accurate information and data in a timely manner to help complete the FMMS. The FMMS should be drawn up as part of readying a proposal prior to submission, with measures identified to be considered in finalising conditions of any authorisations granted. Development of the strategy should be coordinated with other relevant assessments such as EIA where possible. The content of the Fisheries Management and Mitigation Strategy (FMMS) should be relevant to the particular circumstances and could include:</p><p>- An assessment of the potential impact of all stages of the development or other suggested use on the affected fishery or fisheries, both in socio-economic terms and in relation to environmental sustainability. This assessment should include consideration of any impact upon cultural identity within fishing communities, as well as identifying indirect/in-combination matters.</p><p>- A recognition that the disruption to existing fishing opportunities/activity should be minimised as far as possible.</p><p>- Demonstration of the public benefit(s) that outweigh the significant impacts identified.</p><p>- Reasonable measures to mitigate any constraints which the proposed development or use may place on existing or proposed fishing activity.</p><p>- Reasonable measures to mitigate any potential impacts on sustainability of fish stocks (e.g. impacts on spawning grounds or areas of fish or shellfish abundance) and any socio-economic impacts.</p><p>Where it does not prove possible to agree the FMMS with all interests:</p><p>- Divergent views and the reasons for any divergence of views between the parties should be fully explained in the FMMS, and dissenting views should be given a platform within the said FMMS to make their case.</p><p>- Where divergent views are identified, relevant public authorities should be engaged to identify informal and formal steps designed to enable proposal(s) to progress.&rsquo;&rsquo; (Pgs. 137, 138)</p><p>It should also be noted that Fisheries groups were represented on the Marine Spatial Planning Advisory group, who oversaw and informed the development of the policies referred to. These policies came into effect on the adoption of the NMPF in May 2021, and clearly indicate that developers cannot proceed with operations without due consideration for the impact of their activities on other marine users, with particular regard to the Fisheries community. The way in which Fisheries Policy 2 will be implemented will be a subject for consideration at the Seafood/ORE working group.</p><p>With regard to the designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPA), the final report of the MPA Advisory Group was published in Irish and English language versions on 26 January 2021 and is available via this link: <i>Expanding Ireland&rsquo;s Marine Protected Area Network</i>.</p><p>In tandem with my Department&rsquo;s detailed consideration of the expert group&rsquo;s findings, a public consultation phase centred around the report and the wider MPA process began in mid-February 2021 and extended over more than five months to the end of July 2021.</p><p>This consultation and associated communications encouraged all stakeholders and the wider public to get involved by sharing their views on the process by which Ireland&rsquo;s network of MPAs will be expanded into the future. In response to the open call to participate, in total more than 2,200 individual submissions were received by my Department from members of the public and other stakeholders.</p><p>An independent review and analysis of all responses to the public consultation is currently being carried out. The findings and conclusions from this study will be published in the form of a detailed report that presents key data and other information gathered through the public consultation process in an accessible manner. Informed by these important steps and the resulting information, my Department will begin developing legislation on the identification, designation and management of MPAs by November 2021. This work is expected to continue into 2022.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-05a.746.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100500066#WRM02800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 277 and 278 together.</p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended (the Act), all development, unless specifically exempted under the Act or associated Regulations, requires planning permission.  Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.</p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational/community/religious buildings. </p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. Project scoping feedback has been received from interested parties through the draft Request for Tender process and has been considered by my Department in the development of the final Request for Tender documentation. My Department intends to publish the call for tender shortly.  </p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department has advanced interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. It is anticipated that the SEA process will commence, with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the completion of the screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit. The SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside a draft of the interim regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to commence in November. A copy of the draft interim regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before finalisation of the draft interim regulations. This part of the SEA process is expected to be completed by mid-December 2021. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in early 2022. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in Q2 2022. The final supplementary set of regulations - delineating the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply - will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner. </p></reply>

Housing for All details how the Government is approaching this challenge, and includes a commitment to develop a Youth Homelessness Strategy within Quarter 1 of 2022.  Preparing this strategy will involve co-operation and co-ordination between myself and my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Key operational elements in the provision of supports to young people experiencing homelessness, or at risk of homelessness, fall within the responsibility of a range of agencies and stakeholder bodies.</p>  <p>  Upon my appointment as Minister, I established a High Level Homelessness Taskforce, to provide a forum for engagement with key organisations working to address homelessness. The Taskforce is also inputting on the implementation of the commitments on homelessness in the Programme for Government.  The membership of the Taskforce consists of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, Crosscare, Depaul, Focus Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, Dublin Simon Community, Threshold and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</p>  <p>  At its recent meetings I have discussed the preparation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy and sought the views of members of the Taskforce. I expect that work on the Strategy will continue through 2021 and into 2022, with broader stakeholder engagement.</p></reply>

Building on the successful model of social housing PPPs, Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland commits to increasing their use to deliver social housing. Securing value for money (VfM) is an overarching consideration throughout the PPP procurement process and the Central PPP Unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) provides guidance in relation to PPP projects to achieve this objective.  </p>  <p>  The Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) is an essential part of any PPP project. It contains commercially sensitive information in relation to the methodology used for costing public sector projects and for the pricing of risks by public sector bodies. In accordance with the DPER guidelines (Guidelines for the use of Public Private Partnerships), the final PSB, or any elements thereof, is not made public during the tendering process nor where it is intended to procure further similar projects in the near future (e.g. subsequent project bundles as part of an ongoing PPP programme).</p>  <p>  Construction on Bundle 1 of the social housing PPP programme is now complete and the remaining homes in Bundle 2 will be delivered later this year. My Department and the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) are currently working with the relevant Local Authorities including Dublin City Council as Lead Authority to progress the third bundle of sites in this PPP programme. Design development for the project is underway and the statutory consent process is expected to commence in Q4 2021 while tenders will be invited from PPP consortia towards the end of this year.</p>  <p>  As Bundle 3 will follow the same structure as Bundles 1 and 2 and given the potential impact on value for money for the State, it is not appropriate to release the PSB for Bundle 1 at this time. However, and in accordance with the DPER guidelines, once an appropriate period of time has elapsed and the commercial sensitivity of the information on the project is no longer an issue (having regard also to any other similar PPP projects which may be in pre-procurement), the PSB should be made public. My Department will follow these guidelines in relation to the social housing PPP programme.</p></reply>

Currently, 80% of LPT is retained in the area it is collected, with the other 20% supporting equalisation for local authorities with LPT bases lower than their funding baseline.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future', commits to bringing forward LPT reforms including providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 gives effect to a package of measures in line with the commitments in the aforementioned Programme for Government to address the future of the LPT. The Government has signalled its intention that the move to 100% local retention of LPT will be introduced over the 2023 and 2024 budgetary cycles. Any changes to the allocation process may be considered in that context.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, LPT allocations for 2022 will provisionally be based on updated information regarding the 2021 yield, on a no change basis i.e. the 80:20 model. All other elements will also be based on 2021 figures, including the LPT baselines, the equalisation contribution and self-funding of housing and roads from surplus LPT. It is recognised that the yield will change following the revaluation and the matter will be revisited at that point.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, local authorities have had the power to vary the rates of LPT in their areas by up to 15%. The power to vary LPT rates locally enables local authority elected members to directly influence the level of LPT income they have to meet their expenditure requirements. </p>  <p>  When an authority decides to vary the LPT basic rate upwards (by up to 15%) it retains 100% of the resultant additional income collected in the local authority area. Likewise, when the rate is reduced, the authority forgoes the full amount of the reduced LPT income collected.</p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 does not change the extent to which local authorities can vary the local adjustment factor. My Department will publish details on the allocation, including the impact of variation decisions, in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Automatic eligibility is extended to hospitality including hotels, pubs and restaurants, leisure and entertainment, personal services such as hairdressers and barbers, and various other sectors.

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. As set out in "Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland", the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

These limits were agreed in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In reviewing the rent limits, my Department worked closely with DSP and monitored data gathered from the Residential Tenancies Board and the HAP Shared Services Centre.  The HAP rent limits were increased significantly, in the order of 60% in some cases. </p><p>Maximum rent limits for the HAP scheme are set out for each housing authority area by the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2017.  The current maximum HAP rent limits are available on the Irish Statute Book website at the following link:</p><p><i>www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2017/si/56/made/en/print?q=housing&amp;amp;years=2017</i>. </p><p>Local authorities also have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine whether the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.  </p><p>In considering this issue, I am conscious that increasing the current HAP rent limits could have negative inflationary impacts, leading to a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support. </p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review and closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while we increase the supply of social housing. Under Housing for All, my Department will undertake an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of discretion available to Local Authorities under HAP is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support.</p></reply>

These tenancy protections also apply during the 10 days directly following the period specified by the Minister for Health in the aforementioned Regulations. The most recent tenancy protections that applied on foot of a 5km travel restriction covered the period from 31 December 2020 to 22 April 2021. If the Minister for Health makes regulations restricting movement outside a 5 km radius of one's place of residence in the future, the moratorium on evictions taking effect will automatically apply in the relevant area during the relevant period.  </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 introduced permanent protections to provide new procedures to be followed in the context of rent arrears warnings and associated tenancy terminations.</p>  <p>  Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears must be copied to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and will be invalid if it is not so copied. A notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can only be served by a landlord on the condition that a written rent arrears warning was given to both the tenant and the RTB and that the arrears were not paid within 28 days (doubled from 14 days since 1 August 2020) following receipt of the warning by the tenant or by the RTB, whichever occurs later. </p>  <p>  Where a tenancy is to be terminated on grounds of rent arrears on foot of Covid-19, enhanced protections and procedures apply for tenants and landlords under Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (the PDRTA).  The PDRTA provides for temporary modifications to the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, subject to certain conditions, that during the period from 11 January 2021 to 12 January 2022 a 90 day (rather than the usual 28 days) termination notice period applies, where a tenant is in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and is at risk of losing their tenancy. The earliest termination date allowed in such circumstances is 13 January 2022. Rent increases are also prohibited for relevant tenancies until 13 January 2022.</p>  <p>  The targeted ban on rent increases under the PDRTA is due to expire on 12 January 2022. The Government will consider in due course what measures, if any, are required after this date to support tenants in financial difficulty due to Covid-19. The operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 are kept under constant review and any necessary legislation will be introduced. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) displays comprehensive information on its website - www.rtb.ie - including guidance and frequently asked questions documents relating to rent reviews and terminating tenancies during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  A number of targeted measures and initiatives are currently being developed to provide better security of tenure and greater rent certainty for tenants, as well as enhancing the supports and services available to both tenants and landlords through the RTB particularly, to facilitate the development of a more vibrant and sustainable rental sector.  </p>  <p>  - the recent extension of Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ) protections to the end of 2024 and the prohibition on rent increases exceeding any general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which will be re-examined in the light of prevailing inflation rate;</p>  <p>  - the bringing forward of legislation to address long- term security of tenure including by providing for tenancies of indefinite duration, subject to legal advice;</p>  <p>  - to enhance tenancy protections for those living in dwellings that are affected by a receivership situation;</p>  <p>  - amending the Residential Tenancies Acts to provide for default conciliation as the first step in the RTB&rsquo;s dispute resolution process;</p>  <p>  - increasing enforcement of registration of tenancies by RTB;</p>  <p>  - the development and publication of a standard tenancy agreement by the RTB; and</p>  <p>  - reviewing the recommendations of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Landlords, which was chaired by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  The necessary legislative change will be progressed through the Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill 2021, which I intend to bring forward before the end of this D&aacute;il term with a view to early commencement. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to better protect tenants with affordability challenges by extending the operation of RPZs until the end of 2024 and prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). This measure significantly reduced the level of permissible rent increases for the estimated 74% of all tenancies which are in RPZs. The linkage with HICP aims to safeguard continued investment in the sector by existing and new landlords to deliver the much needed supply of high-quality rental accommodation while protecting against a significant increase in rental inflation in the coming years.</p>  <p>  When introducing these measures, I was very clear on the need to carefully monitor inflation. At that time, HICP inflation averaged 0.73% p.a. over the previous 3 years but had risen to 1.6% p.a. in the year ending June 2021. I needed to revise the RPZ rent control relatively quickly in July, on a basis that could be independently verified. The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 also provides that an index, other than HICP, may be prescribed for the purposes of restricting rent increases in RPZs. Given the continuing rise in HICP inflation, up to 3% p.a. in August, I will consider all the legal options available to me to ensure that effective rent controls are legally in force in RPZs to cap the rate of any rent increase where the general inflation rate is too high.  Any necessary provision relating to rent control in RPZs will be considered in the context of the impending Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill 2021. My Department is currently examining this matter and the advices of the Office of the Attorney General will inform any changes in this area. </p></reply>

The plenary working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August), in addition to subgroup meetings. The group&rsquo;s terms of reference were adopted in May 2021 and include:</p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>- Identification and description of defect, </p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected, </p><p>- Type of dwelling affected, </p><p>- Location of dwellings affected. </p><p>3. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated. </p><p>4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action. </p><p>- In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management. </p><p>5. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including: </p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings, </p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work, </p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.  </p><p>6. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options. </p><p>7. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance. </p><p>8. To report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the group will seek to engage with a range of interested parties, including homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals and industry stakeholders, among others to examine the issue of defects in housing and report to me on the matter. Consultation with the relevant parties has commenced and further arrangements in this regard are currently being put in place by the working group.</p><p>I am satisfied that the group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter and I look forward to a report in due course following completion of their deliberation. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents. </p><p>Any further speculation or discussion on the output of the working group, including speculation with regard to the scale of the issue, type of dwelling affected, or the potential cost, is premature at this stage.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020, the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. Fire services may inspect buildings, other than a dwelling house occupied as a single dwelling, in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with those who have control over premises and hold responsibility for fire safety, to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and a plan put in place for works to bring buildings into compliance. They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis.  Local authorities are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p></reply>

The authorisation process provides for the EPA to place stringent conditions on the operation of such discharges to ensure that potential effects on the receiving water bodies are strictly limited and controlled.</p>  <p>  The EPA is the statutory body for the enforcement, both directly and through oversight of Irish Water and local authorities, of environmental legislation in Ireland, including compliance in relation to licensed urban waste water discharges. </p>  <p>  The EPA&rsquo;s report on the performance of urban waste water treatment in 2019 shows that, while many challenges remain, Irish Water is continuing to make progress and is improving our waste water systems.

The Committees also contribute to and participate in the working groups established under each of the five pillars.</p><p>Officials from my Department participate throughout this structure at Board level, working group level and committee level. </p><p>In relation to the legal framework and rules for concrete blocks, these are established in the first place at European level. Since 2013, the Construction Products Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 (CPR) sets out rules for the marketing of construction products in the EU. Where a construction product covered by a harmonised standard is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.</p><p>The manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) and in particular for the Declaration of Performance/CE marking of the construction product he/she is placing on the market, having full knowledge of the raw material (as is legally required by the CPR via the relevant harmonised European Standards) and having regard to the end product&rsquo;s suitability for use in construction works in accordance with the relevant Standard Recommendations published by the NSAI. For example:  </p><p><i>- &lsquo;I.S. EN 771-3:2011+A1:2015&rsquo;</i>deals with aggregate concrete masonry units. NSAI has published additional guidance in the form of &lsquo;<i>S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018/AC:2019 Recommendations for the design of masonry structures in Ireland to Eurocode 6&rsquo; which </i>provides, inter alia, guidance on the choice of masonry units and mortar classes most appropriate for particular situations as regards durability for finished work in Ireland. S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018/AC: 2019 recommends the use of Category 1 aggregate concrete blocks, which requires independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body (a designated body that carries out third-party tasks).</p><p>- In respect of aggregates for concrete, a constituent of concrete masonry units, NSAI has also published <i>&lsquo;S.R. 16:2016 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 12620:2002+A1:2008 - Aggregates for concrete&rsquo; </i>which<i></i>outlines the precautions to be taken in the quarry to reduce the risk of harmful impurities in aggregate production, including the requirement for independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body.</p><p>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No.225 of 2013), each of the building control authorities (local authorities) have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. </p><p>In addition, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 (Construction Products &ndash; Market Surveillance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 682 of 2020) appointed Dublin City Council as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions under the  European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 for all related construction products on a nationwide basis. </p><p>Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO) Market Surveillance Unit has been established for this purpose. DCC-NBCO may be contacted at: support@nbco.gov.ie.  Building control authorities will liaise with DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise. </p><p>It is important to note that the service delivered by DCC-NBCO is complementary to the existing role of the 31 Building Control Authorities who are also Market Surveillance Authorities.  Building control authorities and DCC-NBCO are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers.</p><p>The National market surveillance programme 2021 provides specific details on the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by DCC-NBCO, which has recently commenced, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR.</p><p>In 2020, my Department provided a budget allocation of &euro;500,000 to support the development of this Market Surveillance Unit in DCC-NBCO.  &euro;147,000 of the budget was expended as the project was at the early development set up phase.  In 2021, my Department has provided a budget allocation of &euro;564,000 to continue to support the development, and resourcing of the Market Surveillance Unit in DCC-NBCO.</p></reply>

This will allow each Local Authority to determine the affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment. </p>  <p>  The Housing for All Strategy delivers on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system.  It is the largest State-led building programme in our history, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4bn per annum.</p>  <p>  At a national level, over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. These homes will be provided by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency (LDA), as well as through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.</p>  <p>  Specifically regarding affordability-constrained households wishing to buy homes, the Housing for All strategy contains a multi-pronged approach to improving affordability.</p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Homes scheme and the First Home scheme are primarily focused on supporting first-time buyers purchasing newly built homes. Both of these schemes will be targeted at households constrained by the maximum mortgage and deposit available to them. The gap between the market value and what the household can afford (including with the assistance of the &lsquo;Help to Buy&rsquo; incentive) will be bridged via the provision of equity support. The equity support can subsequently be redeemed at any time at the home-owners discretion, or remain outstanding until the home is sold or passed on.</p>  <p>  In addition to these distinct shared equity schemes, the Housing for All strategy also provides for the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021.  The Local Authority Home Loan is a successor to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan Scheme, and will include an increase in the income ceiling for single applicants, thus increasing the number of people eligible. From 10 September 2021, I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the forthcoming Local Authority Home Loan.  The Help to Buy scheme is also currently available to help purchasers in accessing homes.</p>  <p>  Further to the above, the Housing for All strategy also provides for the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe initiative intended to service sites and refurbish existing vacant properties in regional towns and villages.</p>  <p>  Collectively, these measures will improve affordability for all families or individuals wishing to purchase a home.</p></reply>

Supporting individuals and families facing homelessness is a key Government priority.  Housing for All details how the Government will approach this challenge and includes a commitment to develop a National Youth Homelessness Strategy within Quarter 1 of 2022.  Preparing this strategy will involve co-operation and co-ordination between myself and my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Key operational elements in the provision of supports to young people experiencing homelessness, or at risk of homelessness, fall within the responsibility of a range of agencies and stakeholder bodies.  Their views will also form part of the process in developing the Strategy.</p>  <p>  Maximum rent limits for the HAP scheme are set out for each housing authority area by the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2017.

It should be noted that it is a matter for the local authority to determine whether the application of the flexibility is warranted on a case by case basis and also the level of additional discretion applied in each case.   </p>  <p>  My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review and closely monitors the level of discretion being used by local authorities, taking into account other sources of data, including Residential Tenancies Board rent data published on a quarterly basis. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that HAP levels are adequate to support vulnerable households, while we increase the supply of social housing.  Under Housing for All, my Department will, by end 2021, undertake an exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of discretion available to Local Authorities under HAP is required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for Rent Supplement falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

The initial timeframes submitted by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) were based on all efforts being made to deliver the homes as soon as possible. As AHBs sought to use CREL funding to allow developers to construct homes that may otherwise not have been delivered, the commencement of construction on these specific units was in most instances not possible until the lifting of relevant COVID restrictions. </p>  <p>  Based on updated delivery timeframes from the relevant AHBs, the estimated additional Cost Rental homes that will be purchased and made available for tenanting by the end of the first quarter of 2022 will be c.170. These homes will be in addition to the first CREL-financed homes which have been delivered by the Cl&uacute;id AHB at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan, and the 50 Cost Rental apartments due for completion shortly at Enniskerry Road, for which tenancy applications have already been accepted. The remaining homes will come on stream during 2022.</p>  <p>  The necessary financial and commercial arrangements in relation to these CREL-financed projects are being completed by the AHBs concerned. When these arrangements are concluded, details of the other projects, including specific locations, housing typologies, and cost-covering rents, will be made public.</p>  <p>  Just one year after coming in to office, this Government has introduced what is a brand new form of tenure in Cost Rental.  It has placed Cost Rental on a statutory basis through the provisions of the Affordable Housing Act 2021, the first ever stand-alone affordable housing legislation in the State.  It has established administrative provisions and provided the funds which has seen the first tenants already in long term and secure homes at up to 50% of the comparable market cost.</p>  <p>  The Government recently confirmed plans to drastically increase delivery and its Housing for All Strategy is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of the State, backed up by an unprecedented financial commitment in excess of &euro;4bn per annum. Over the period 2021 to 2030, it is intended that approximately 18,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and the Land Development Agency. In building to this scale and an average of 2,000 Cost Rental Units per year, the State will provide certain focused funding supports to help delivery partners provide rental homes that target affordable rents at levels in the order of 25% below market rents.</p></reply>

Ireland has repeatedly emphasised that the rights of children to education without fear of violence or attack must be upheld at all times. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on these issues is, and will continue to be, based on international law, including Israel&rsquo;s obligations as the occupying Power under the Fourth Geneva Convention. I remain deeply troubled by the lack of accountability for violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory, including in relation to attacks on education. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to be active on these issues in the United Nations Security Council. At the Council meeting on the situation in the Middle East on 29 September, Ireland expressed concern about the recent increase in violence in the occupied Palestinian territory. Referring to the incidence of settler violence on 28 September in the South Hebron Hills in which a young child was seriously injured, Ireland called on the Israeli authorities to hold those responsible accountable and to end the culture of impunity around all such incidents of violence.</p>  <p>  I have also raised these matters with my counterparts at EU level. At an informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 27 May, I called on EU colleagues to address the root causes of violence, including settlement expansion, in a more robust way. I raised similar points at the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 June. It is vital that the international community does all it can to seek to address the root causes of violence and tension.</p></reply>

The Government's support for a D&aacute;il motion earlier this year, declaring that Israel&rsquo;s settlement policy in occupied Palestinian territory amounts to unlawful de facto annexation, reflected our grave concern about the scale and character of settlements and their negative impact.</p>  <p>  I have conveyed in the strongest terms my concerns about settlement announcements to the Israeli Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid. Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Tel Aviv has also raised the issue directly with the Israeli authorities. Ireland's Representative Office in Ramallah has made a number of visits along with EU colleagues to sensitive sites of concern in the West Bank.</p>  <p>  We will continue to proactively raise our concerns about settlements at national and EU level, in statements at the UN Human Rights Council, the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council, and in our bilateral contacts. </p>  <p>  The human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territory more generally remains a matter of serious concern. The promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. </p>  <p>  In February, Ireland made a statement in the interactive dialogue with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, where we stressed the importance of accountability for all violations of international law committed in the occupied Palestinian territory. </p>  <p>  In March, at the Human Rights Council session, Ireland co-sponsored Resolutions on Human Rights and Accountability, Self-Determination and Settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory. We also made a national statement under Item 7 during the General Debate, which urged Israel to halt settlement expansion and demolitions and allow for legal construction for Palestinian communities.  </p>  <p>  In May, Ireland supported a special session of the Human Rights Council on the escalation of violence. The Human Rights Council voted to establish a Commission of Inquiry on the oPt at that session. In keeping with our principled position on Commissions of Inquiry established by the HRC, Ireland supports the work of the Commission of Inquiry.</p>  <p>  Ireland regularly raises these issues also at the Security Council, including on 29 September, when Ireland chaired the Council&rsquo;s monthly meeting on the situation in the Middle East.</p>  <p>  Ireland also provides financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs working on human rights issues.</p></reply>

However, regardless of how a state may name and define itself - be it socialist, democratic, united, Islamic, Arab or Jewish - full respect for the equal rights of all citizens &ndash; irrespective of ethnicity, religion, or other similar factors &ndash; is strictly required under international human rights law.  </p>  <p>  It is imperative that the rights of non-Jewish citizens of Israel are not infringed and that there is respect and tolerance for the diversity of its population. I am fully committed to raising such issues of equality with Israel. Where Ireland has concerns in relation to laws and practices which undermine equality among citizens and disregard the rights of minorities, particularly the Palestinian minority, we make our views known to Israel. We have, for example, expressed our concern about the Nation State Law where we had concerns that it might enable discriminatory practice against non-Jewish citizens. </p>  <p>  All States, including Ireland and Israel, have obligations under international law, including international human rights law. In respect of the occupied Palestinian territory, we are clear on Israel&rsquo;s responsibility under international humanitarian law to respect the rights of the civilian population living under its occupation, who have the status of protected persons under the Fourth Geneva Convention, for as long as the occupation continues. </p>  <p>  I have raised these issues consistently and vocally, both publicly and in conversations with Israeli government interlocutors.  I will continue to do so.</p></reply>

The Government remains committed to returning to, and maintaining the agreed strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel and significant work continues in order to restore the PDF to its full capacity.  </p><p>Personnel leave the Permanent Defence Force for a number of reasons including on age grounds, at the end of contract and voluntary discharges.  More than 50% of those who leave the Defence Forces do so with some form of pension. This can make taking up a position in the private sector very attractive where a full-time position, even at the same rates as those in the Defence Forces, could lead to an increase in an individual&rsquo;s earnings. </p><p>In that context, I have fully acknowledged the retention issues affecting both officers and enlisted personnel.  A range of actions have been taken to address these issues which includes the 15 projects undertaken to facilitate the implementation of the PSPC Report on Recruitment and Retention. Most of these projects have been completed with others being considered in the context of wider public sector pay arrangements. </p><p>Other measures undertaken, aimed at retaining capacity, include two Commitment Schemes, one in the Air Corps which has had a stabilising effect on pilot numbers and one in the Naval Service to incentivise sea going duties. A sea going naval personnel tax credit has been extended for the 2021 tax year and has been increased to &euro;1,500. </p><p>Recruitment in 2021 has resulted in 406 inductions as at 27th September.  The current recruitment initiatives, complementing the above retention measures in countering current staffing challenges, include:</p><p>- Traditional recruitment is ongoing and further inductions are expected.  This includes:</p><p>- Continuing General Service recruitment which, in October 2021, will result in 95 further recruits commencing training. </p><p>- The 2021 Cadet offers process,  expected to conclude on 22<sup>nd</sup>October.</p><p>- The scope of ongoing direct entry competitions remains under consideration and expanded in 2021 which, along with reviews of direct entry terms and conditions, will further improve intakes. </p><p>- The re-entry campaign for former members of the PDF continues and resulted in 1 re-commissioning officer and 28 re-enlisting personnel in 2021. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that as part of the terms of reference of the Independent Commission on the Defence Forces, the Commission is considering appropriate recruitment and retention approaches, having regard to work undertaken to date and international best practice, to deliver the capabilities required of a modern military force.  I look forward to receiving the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations. </p></reply>

The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p><p>The Defence Forces have received pay increases in line with the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the most recent of which was a 2% increase on annualised salaries from 1<sup>st</sup>October 2020. </p><p>The restoration of the 5% cut in allowances imposed under the Financial Emergency in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation, was also restored from 1<sup>st</sup>October 2020. </p><p>In addition to the general round of pay increases awarded to public servants, members of the Permanent Defence Force have also benefitted from the implementation of increases in Defence Force allowances as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission. These included: </p><p>- a 10% increase in military service allowance, </p><p>- the restoration of a 10% cut applied to a number of Defence Forces allowances under the Haddington Road Pay Agreement </p><p>- the restoration of premium rates for weekend security duty allowances. </p><p>- the restoration of a service commitment scheme for pilots. </p><p>The introduction of a new sea-going service commitment scheme for Naval Service personnel, which came into effect from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2021, is aimed at retaining highly trained and experienced personnel, while also incentivising sea going duties.</p><p>Furthermore, a sea going naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270 was applied in 2020 for members of the Naval Service who served 80 days or more at sea in 2019. This tax credit has been extended for a further year and is increased to &euro;1,500 for the 2021 tax year. </p><p>Negotiations on a new public service agreement were held in late 2020 with public service trade unions and representative associations. A new agreement &lsquo;<i>Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo;, </i>has subsequently been ratified by the overwhelming majority of public sector unions. Following a ballot of their members the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, namely RACO and PDFORRA, formally notified the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) of  their intention to comply with this agreement. </p><p>In return for ongoing reform and productivity measures the agreement provides for further increases in pay to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces. This agreement includes the following increases:</p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on 1<sup>st </sup>October 2021. </p><p>- The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1<sup>st </sup>February 2022. </p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater on, 1<sup>st</sup>October 2022.</p><p>Notably, all Defence Force personnel also receive three additional public holidays over and above the public sector norms. These additional holidays are specific only to members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p><p>The Government remains fully committed to addressing pay and conditions in the Defence Forces and this is reflected in the Programme for Government. This provided for the establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces, which was established on the 15<sup>th</sup>December 2020 and completion of the Commissions work, I will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body for the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

Of this some 603 personnel or 7% were female, broken down as follows:</p>  <p>  - Army: 492 Female Personnel </p>  <p>  - Air Corps: 39 Female Personnel </p>  <p>  - Naval Service: 72 Female Personnel </p>  <p>  In line with current policies and commitments a number of initiatives have been implemented to increase the level of female participation in the Permanent Defence Force. For example:</p>  <p>  - Special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment within the general recruitment framework.   </p>  <p>  - A Gender, Equality and Diversity Officer has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. The Defence Forces are committed to gender equality and employ a gender perspective in the planning and execution of operations both at home and overseas and in all policies and regulations. Gender Advisors are available to all Brigades and Services and trained Gender Focal Points are deployed with all overseas units and ships in order to promote a gender perspective in operations. </p>  <p>  - A Defence Forces Women's Network was established with the aim of increasing the participation of female personnel at all levels of the organisation. </p>  <p>  Over the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence, a number of projects will be progressed to encourage more women to apply for the Defence Forces and to increase female participation at all ranks.</p>  <p>  In addition, 15 projects, undertaken to facilitate the implementation of the Public Service Pay Commission Report on Recruitment and Retention, are mostly completed. </p>  <p>  I listened with concern to the women who recounted their experiences on the Women of Honour programme on RT&Eacute; Radio on the 11 September 2021. </p>  <p>  Last week, I met with participants from the Women of Honour group and with a group of serving female members of the Defence Forces, where I had the opportunity to listen carefully to their experiences, in what were very informative meetings.  I would like to express my deep appreciation to the women, both former and serving members, for highlighting this serious matter and for taking the time to meet with me.  Participants from the Women of Honour group met with the Secretary General and a senior official from my Department recently and I understand this was also a productive meeting.</p>  <p>  It is clear to me, the Chief of Staff, and the Secretary General that there are very strong views that the culture that is pervading, and the application of the current policies, systems and procedures in place for dealing with bullying, harassment, discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual assault have not, and are not, serving all Defence Forces personnel well.  I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to anyone who has suffered during their time in the Defence Forces and to assure them that the State will carry out an Independent Review, which will be undertaken by external and entirely independent and unbiased experts in this field.  This Review will examine the effectiveness of these policies, systems and procedures.  </p>  <p>  The terms of the Review, which are in the process of being finalised, are being reviewed in light of  recent meetings with the Women of Honour group and with serving female personnel.  Further engagement with the Women of Honour Group on the Terms of the Review is proposed.

The settlements mainly covered historical liabilities for certain accommodation and medical arrangements in relation to the Permanent Defence Force (PDF). Many of the arrangements in question were in place since the foundation of the State. The Finance Act 2018 exempted the medical and accommodation issues in question from benefit in kind (BIK) for members of the PDF with effect from 1 January 2018. The settlement in 2020 relates to BIK in relation to statutory hospital charges for the dependants of enlisted members of the PDF in 2019.</p><p>I note from the details supplied and your further clarification that issues arose in the case referred to with regard to overpayments.  In this regard, I have set out below the details of overpayments in the Defence Organisation over the last 5 years: </p><p><b>Overpayments breakdown 2016-2020:</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2016</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals</td>       <td>&euro;175,210</td>       <td>&euro;196,132</td>       <td>&euro;162,198</td>       <td>&euro;90,623</td>       <td>&euro;51,117</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The above figures include Defence Forces' personnel, civil servants and civilian employees. In some of these instances, overpayments are unavoidable (i.e. an inherent overpayment) as the relevant information may not be received by the Department prior to the payroll closedown date, which is in advance of the date of payment.  As a result, it is unavoidable that a number of overpayments occur on the payroll.  There are processes and procedures in place to minimise overpayments, to identify and recoup those that do occur and to manage those overpayments.</p><p>The amount of overpayments written off in the same 5 year period is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th><b>2020</b></th>       <th><b>2019</b></th>       <th><b>2018</b></th>       <th><b>2017</b></th>       <th><b>2016</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;9,481</td>       <td>&euro;556</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>&euro;10,578</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The only State body under the aegis of my Department is the Army Pensions Board.  The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act 1927 to provide for the payment of pensions, allowances and gratuities in certain circumstances to members of the Defence Forces.No overpayments arose in respect of the Army Pensions Board over this period. </p></reply>

Parental preferences in relation to patronage and language of instruction (Irish or English) from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity of provision in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of such processes. </p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p><font color="#001A26">- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">  - As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA). </p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s request for information regarding NEPS service to a list of Meath schools, I wish to advise that each of these schools has access to NEPS for Critical Incident Support, the NEPS Regional Support and Development Service and for responses to queries arising.  Twenty-two of the schools have an assigned NEPS psychologist for a casework service and thirty-four of the schools, while awaiting the appointment of NEPS psychologists, have access to the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA) for a casework service.  </p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>-  Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>-  No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>-  SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>-  Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be  processed in order of date received.</p><p>-  As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website <i>ncse.ie/for-schools</i>.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020  are available on the Departments website.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

Nevertheless, my Department will continue to work to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the area to meet school place demand and will keep the requirements in Killester_Raheny_Clontarf, as with all other school planning areas, under review.</p>  <p>  Should it be decided in the future, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required, a patronage process would be conducted to determine the patronage of the school. Parental preferences in relation to patronage and language of instruction (Irish or English) from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity of provision in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of such processes. </p></reply>

The Steering Group is leading on the identification of issues, the development of a programme of actions on teacher supply and overseeing its implementation. It is supported by an Implementation Group and a number of working groups which are considering specific areas of policy. </p><p>The Teacher Supply Action Plan, published in November 2018, includes a range of actions under four policy headings: data/research to support teacher supply planning; higher education; policies and arrangements impacting on teacher supply; and communications / promotion of the teaching profession.</p><p>A number of measures have been out in place to match available teachers with vacancies </p><p>Following a successful pilot in 2019/ 2020 there are now 132 primary school supply panels in operation, providing cover for substitute vacancies in 80% of primary schools (approximately 2,550 schools) and employing 377 teachers.</p><p><i>Sub Seeker</i>, a central portal for short term substitute vacancies, jointly developed by the Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network (IPPN) and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD), has operated since late 2019 and matches available teachers with short-term substitute vacancies in primary and post-primary schools.</p><p>In addition, <i>Turasabhaile</i>, a service developed by the post-primary school management bodies and NAPD, matches registered teachers resident abroad with post-primary vacancies. The IPPN is also developing a new central portal for the recruitment of teachers to long-term positions in primary and post-primary schools. It is anticipated that this portal will be available to schools and teachers in the coming months.</p><p>A number of measures have also been put in place to increase the supply of teachers at post primary level, particularly in subjects where difficulties in recruitment have been reported.</p><p>Following engagement with the Higher Education Authority (HEA), higher education institutions (HEIs) put in place new post-primary initial teacher education (ITE) undergraduate programmes in 2019, 2020 and 2021, in priority subject areas, including mathematics, modern foreign languages and Irish.</p><p>The HEA, on behalf of my Department, issued a call to ITE providers for proposals for programmes to upskill already registered teachers in targeted post-primary subjects (Spanish, mathematics and physics).  The programmes, which commenced in January 2021, will run over two years on a part-time, flexible basis.  There is no fee charge for participating teachers.</p><p>Earlier this year I, along with my colleague Minister Harris, announced an additional programme to upskill teachers in Irish, to begin in 2022. My Department is currently engaging with the HEA in regard to a call to ITE providers for the provision of this programme.</p><p>These measures are underpinned by the <i>Teaching Transforms</i>campaign, which promotes the teaching profession and encourages students to follow a career in teaching. The campaign uses digital, radio and video media, and is supported by a dedicated webpage, <i>www.gov.ie/teachingtransforms</i>.</p><p>My Department will continue, with the cooperation of the education partners, to develop and implement measures to support the supply of teachers to our schools.</p></reply>

In the 2020/2021 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time for the 2021/22 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  This year I have extended measures to ensure that all post-primary pupils who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and who have applied and paid on time will be accommodated on school transport services. This arrangement is in place for current school year pending completion of the full review of the School Transport Scheme.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that to date 104,324 pupils, including 54,728 post primary eligible pupils and 14,735 post primary concessionary pupils have been issued tickets for the School Transport Scheme. This number is changing as tickets continue to be allocated to pupils. In the region of 98% of all valid and paid on time applicants have been issued with a ticket. </p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and are offered seats where capacity exists after all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  My Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme,  its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately.</p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review the Steering Group recently presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme will take place in the next phase of the review which is now underway. The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses, with a view to presenting a final report with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme.</p></reply>

This brings the total number of special classes nationally to 2,118. The new classes provide 1,600 additional places, spread right throughout the country.</p><p>Two new special schools are also opening this year, one in Dublin and one in Cork.</p><p>Despite this unprecedented increase, I am very aware of the need for further specialist education places in a small number of areas, mainly concentrated in Dublin.</p><p>Currently, there are 38 special classes for students with autism attached to mainstream primary schools in South - Western Cork, five of which were newly established for the 2021/2022 school year.  This also includes 4 Early Intervention classes, providing placements for students in the area. <b></b>In Cork City and County as a whole, there are 228 primary school special classes providing placements for students with autism.</p><p>I acknowledge that any delay in securing a suitable school placement can cause much anguish for parents and families involved.</p><p>Delays can happen for a variety of reasons including, for example, assessment reports for children becoming available over the summer period while schools were closed. In other cases, parents may change their preference for a class placement and request that their child move from a mainstream class to a special class. </p><p>My Department and the NCSE have therefore put in place new planning structures and procedures to ensure sufficient places become available to meet local need. As new need emerges, there is a cohesive response available to ensure places become available in a timely and targeted way. </p><p>I am aware that the NCSE is currently engaging with four primary schools in the area referenced by the Deputy regarding the establishment of additional special classes for 2022/23 and beyond.</p><p>The willingness of school communities to open special classes is central to ensuring that every child can obtain a suitable placement.  My Department and the NCSE can provide the necessary funding, teaching and SNA resources, professional supports and training so that the required special class places can be provided as soon as possible.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) continue to be available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. </p><p>Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: ncse.ie/regional-servic.</p></reply>

Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; </p><p>-  an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs.</p><p>-  consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>-  the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>-  an independent appeals process.</p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress the EPSEN Act.  </p><p>It should be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. </p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  </p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is to carry out a review of the EPSEN Act. </p><p>This review will take into account the range of reforms and increased investment in supports which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on the outcome of an assessment.  The requirement for a diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category so account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.</p><p>Policy advice has been requested from the NCSE on the implications of the UNCRPD and this is expected in the coming months.</p></reply>

In common with a number of job-role based allowances, sanction for payment to new beneficiaries of the Gaeltacht allowance was withdrawn from 1<sup>st</sup>February 2012 under the terms of the Circular.  Furthermore, if a teacher was eligible for receipt of the allowance prior to 1<sup>st</sup>February 2012 and subsequently left that job role on or after 1<sup>st</sup>February 2012 on a voluntary basis, their entitlement to the allowance ceases from the date of the move and they cannot re-gain entitlement. </p><p>Additional amendments to Teacher Terms and Conditions, including pay and allowances, can only be achieved through engagement and collective bargaining agreements between the Government and the public service unions.

Any review of the eligibility criteria for qualification allowances can occur only under that process and any such proposals would need to be considered in detail by the Department should the relevant unions seek to engage on this. </p></reply>

In addition, all post-primary pupils who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and who have applied and paid on time will be accommodated on school transport services. This arrangement is in place for current school year pending completion of the full review of the School Transport Scheme.   </p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and are offered seats where capacity exists after all eligible children have been catered for. </p>  <p>  Late applicants and/or families who pay late are not guaranteed a seat and will only be allocated a seat if capacity is available once seats are allocated to those families who applied and paid on time for transport services for the 2021/2022 school year. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is attending their second closest school.  However Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that an application for transport was first received for this pupil on 20/08/2021 for the 2021/22 school and was therefore a late application year and that no payment for transport has been received to date for this pupil.</p>  <p>  The existing school transport service is currently operating to capacity and there are no seats available at present. </p></reply>

For the 2021/22 school year the staffing schedule is on the basis of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils.  </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio shows an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 14.5:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2020/21 school year.  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 23.3 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule which now stands at a new historical low will help ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.  </p>  <p>  As part of the supports provided under The Roadmap for the Full Return to School in 2020, specific funding was provided to support Principals who undertake teaching duties in primary schools.  This funding provided each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week.  Schools have been advised that, in the context of COVID-19, the additional allocation of Principal Release Days outlined in Circular 45/2020, "COVID-19 Operational Supports for the Full Return to School" will remain in place for the 2021/22 school year and each school with a teaching principal will have 37 Principal Release Days. </p>  <p>  In total 1700 additional leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools since the lifting of the moratorium on posts of responsibility in 2017, which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  The Department has committed to annually revising the allocation of Posts of Responsibility to take into account retirements during the school year which ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibility are maintained in the school system. The most recent update for the current school year is available on the Department's website (Circular 0025/2021). This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p>  <p>  The Substitute Teacher Supply Panel was expanded last year, from a pilot scheme consisting of 6 base schools to 132 Substitute Teacher Supply Panels nationwide, with almost 380 newly appointed Supply Panel teachers employed, providing substitute cover to over 2,500 schools across the country.  Primary schools have been informed that the Supply Panel Scheme will continue for the 2021/22 school year.</p>  <p>  I understand the need for improved capitation funding and I am pleased that Budget 2020 has been able to provide for a further 2.5% increase in standard capitation funding for primary schools that applied from the start of the 2020/21 school year. This builds on the 5% increase in capitation announced in Budget 2019.</p>  <p>  The combined increases given in 2019 and 2020 mean that circa 40% restoration will be achieved. </p>  <p>  All schools have received the benefit of the capitation increases awarded to date. It is my intention to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets.</p></reply>

While the Department is aware that some schools are operating some classes in purchased prefabs around the country (funded by the Department and/or by the school authority), accurate information in respect of purchased prefabs is not readily available across the entire school estate and these are, therefore, excluded from this response. </p>  <p>  While it is the policy of my Department to ensure a high standard of permanent accommodation for all schools, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population over the last decade or more it is sometimes necessary to make use of temporary accommodation to meet the accommodation needs of schools. Furthermore, it may also be necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation when an immediate or short term need arises. For example, a school may require a temporary building in circumstances where a major school construction project is planned. Such temporary accommodation is removed when the major project concerned is completed. The length of time it is necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation will vary from project to project.  </p>  <p>  I can, however, confirm that my Department is taking an integrated approach to prefab replacement through the replacement of prefabs as part of all large-scale projects. In addition, since mid-2018 all schools approved for additional accommodation under my Department&rsquo;s Additional Accommodation Scheme are having their necessary prefabs replaced as part of their additional accommodation project. This integrated approach helps to streamline the delivery of projects for schools</p>  <p>  There are approximately 1,200 school building projects within the current pipeline across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction - most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period 2021 to 2025.  The progression and completion of these projects will make further inroads on the replacement of temporary prefabricated accommodation with knock-on savings on the rental budget.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is currently undertaking a case by case assessment of the long-term accommodation requirements of all schools that have rented prefabricated accommodation, informed by my Department&rsquo;s most recent national demographic analysis.  Many of these schools are already part of the pipeline of projects under the school building programme and their prefab accommodation will be addressed as part of these projects.  Maximising the opportunities to achieve value for money involves matching, as best as possible, the accommodation requirement with the appropriate accommodation solution. This is relevant for all accommodation projects progressed by the Department.</p>  <p>  The changing landscape in relation to enrolments means that accommodation requirements can vary regionally and between short, medium and long-term and this is a relevant factor considered by the Department in determining the type of accommodation solution to be put in place. </p></reply>

However, the position is that the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is an economy wide support. The objective of EWSS is to support all employment and to maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The scheme is open to all businesses, provided the business meets the requisite conditions of the scheme. It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment. </p>  <p>  The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;4.9 billion and PRSI credit of almost &euro;784 million have been granted to 51,500 employers in respect of over 664,700 workers. </p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made in June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021. For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. </p>  <p>  Further, as announced Tuesday 28th September, the Government has agreed that there will be no change to the EWSS for the month of October 2021, which means that the scheme will continue to operate in its current form as per the arrangements for Q3 2021. Issues around the configuration of the EWSS beyond October are currently being considered and full details will be announced on Budget Day, 12 October 2021. </p>  <p>  I would also note that the Government have put in place a range of measures to support people and businesses most affected by the financial shock of the pandemic, including the arts and cultural sector. The Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) and Tourism Business Continuity scheme have also been established in order to support those businesses most at risk. Other schemes which have been established include the Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS) and the Music Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS), both of which are targeted at supporting the commercial live performance sector. Details of the supports are available on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s website at the following link - enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/ .</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time. </p></reply>

Entitlement to these supports is not contingent on the nature of the illness/disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  My Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department operates the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme which is a group of benefits for people injured or incapacitated by an accident at work or while travelling directly to or from work. The scheme also covers people who have contracted a disease as a result of the type of work they do. There are a number of benefits available and there are different conditions attached to each benefit. The benefits include: Injury Benefit, Disablement Benefit, Incapacity Supplement, Constant Attendance Allowance and the Medical Care Scheme.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 does not constitute a prescribed disease or illness as set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as it does not meet the criteria laid down in the Act.  Section 87 (2) of the Act states that a disease or injury shall be prescribed for the purposes of this section in relation to any insured persons, where the Minister is satisfied that&mdash;</p>  <p>  (a) it ought to be treated, having regard to its causes and any other relevant considerations, as a risk of their occu­pations and not as a risk common to all persons, and</p>  <p>  (b) it is such that, in the absence of special circumstances, the attribution of particular cases to the nature of the employment can be established or presumed with reason­able certainty.</p>  <p>  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.  It is payable for up to two years, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  An enhanced Illness Benefit is payable for up to ten weeks for people diagnosed with Covid-19, subject to ongoing medical certification.  In a case where a person continues to be ill with Covid-19 beyond ten weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.</p>  <p>  Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are &ldquo;permanently incapable of work&rdquo; because of illness or disability.  It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and medical condition and is not means tested. </p>  <p>  Disability Allowance (DA) is a means-tested payment for people with a specified disability who are aged between 16 and 66.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.</p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means-tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for other schemes.  The Department may also make an Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.   </p>  <p>  The Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.  As set out above, a comprehensive set of income support payments is in place for those experiencing illness and disability, based on a person&rsquo;s medical condition and either their social insurance contributions or means testing.  It is generally the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work rather than the nature of the illness or disability that is taken into account when eligibility is being assessed.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Support for longer duration training or courses of study provided by Solas, Education Training Boards or other agencies should be applied for under the Back to Education or Part-Time Education Option schemes.</p>  <p>  The TSG can be provided where an immediate skills gap is identified that represents an obstacle to taking up a job offer or accessing other opportunities.  The grant can be used for training up to level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications or training such as safe pass, driving licenses, HACCP or security industry permits as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Under the 2020 July Stimulus, funding available through this grant was doubled from &euro;500 to &euro;1,000 and there is a provision of &euro;11.3m for this support for 2021.

WPEP is a key policy initiative under the Government's new national employment services strategy; Pathways to Work 2021-2025.  This sets out the national framework for activation and employment supports to assist persons, whose employment has been adversely affected by COVID, back to work, while continuing to support those who were unemployed pre-pandemic to find jobs.</p>  <p>  WPEP is a funded work placement scheme to provide work experience for 10,000 jobseekers that have been unemployed for more than six months, including time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP). Participation on WPEP is entirely voluntary.   WPEP provides quality and valuable work experience to unemployed persons. Work placements are recognised internationally as being effective in assisting jobseekers find new jobs by breaking the cycle of &lsquo;no experience&rsquo; &lsquo;no job&rsquo;  - where the lack of work experience limits jobseekers opportunities when seeking employment.   This is one of the measures recommended by the Labour Market Advisory Council for inclusion in the new Pathways Strategy.   </p>  <p>  Payments to participants will be &euro;306 per week plus increases for qualified adults and children.  Underlying entitlement to secondary benefits (such as fuel allowance, Christmas bonus) are not affected by participation The WPEP rate of payment per hour equates to &euro;10.20 per hour, which is equivalent to the national minimum wage for 30 hour(s) a week placement.  This rate, plus personal allowances, is paid to all participants, regardless of age. All placements will provide training opportunities and in particular, participants will be provided with opportunities to undertake accredited training as part of the programme. Options include a new QQI accredited work placement award which will be delivered by the Education and Training Boards at levels 3, 4 and 5.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated the WPEP will run for two years from 2021 and will therefore continue throughout 2022. Full details regarding WPEP terms and conditions can be found in the operational guidelines located on the government website at gov.ie - Operational Guidelines: Work Placement Experience Programme (www.gov.ie). </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;65.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2021.</p>  <p>  The programme provides funding towards food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes: the urban school meals scheme and the school meals (local projects) scheme.  The Urban School Meals Scheme for primary schools is operated and administered by local authorities and is part-financed by my Department.  </p>  <p>  In recent years, entry to the School Meals Scheme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the School Meals Programme.  </p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools and organisations that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, which included Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme.  These schools and organisations have continued to remain in the scheme since the introduction of DEIS in 2005 but their level of funding has been capped at the same rate year on that year to allow for the concentration of the scheme on DEIS schools.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education is in the final stages of refinement of the new DEIS identification model, based on school enrolment data and the latest data available from Census 2016 using the HP Deprivation Index. A detailed quality analysis of the data has been carried out by members of the DEIS Technical Group which contains officials from their Department and the Educational Research Centre. The work of this group is at an advanced stage and a consultation process with education stakeholder representatives on the technical aspect of this model has commenced. It is envisaged that this will then provide the basis for development of a DEIS resource allocation system to match resources to identified need. </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy was one of 175 non-DEIS schools that were identified by the Department of Education as requiring additional supports and were invited to apply for a breakfast club following the publication of the DEIS Action Plan 2017. They have operated a breakfast club since the 2017/2018 academic year. As this is a non-DEIS school, the level of funding provided is capped. Schools are advised of their allocation at the beginning of the academic year and are asked to manage their expenditure for the year ahead accordingly.</p>  <p>  I intend to commission an independent evaluation of the school meals programme to inform future policy decisions in relation to the scheme. Current Departmental policy in relation to non-DEIS schools will be examined as part of this evaluation.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Membership includes relevant Government Departments (including Children, Equality, Disability, Integration &amp;amp; Youth; Education; Health and Social Protection) and representatives from Crosscare, the Society of St Vincent de Paul and the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.

Recipients retain the advantages of the Jobseeker's Allowance scheme, such as the retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2021 Further Revised Estimate provides for expenditure of &euro;61.7 million on Farm Assist. </p>  <p>  The means test for Farm Assist takes account of all income sources and farm outgoings.  There are annual disregards for dependent children; &euro;254 for each of the first two children and &euro;381 for the third and other children. Remaining farm income and income from off-farm self-employment is then assessed at 70%. In line with other means tested social welfare schemes, the first &euro;20,000 of capital is not assessed.</p>  <p>  At present, specified income disregards apply to income received under the following agri-environmental grant schemes: the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS), the Agri-Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS), the National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme (NPWS) and the Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS). A disregard of &euro;2,540 applies to the total payments through these schemes with 50% of the balance assessed as means.</p>  <p>  The Forestry Premium Payments Scheme applies to farmers and others who have land under afforestation. Premiums paid under this scheme are assessed in line with the normal farm income, at 70%. On the basis that 10% of recipients are in receipt of the forestry premium payments, the additional cost of including them under the existing disregard applied to the agri-environmental grant schemes would be over &euro;1 million in a full year. This does not take account of any future inflows to the scheme if Forestry Premium Payments were included. </p>  <p>  In the case of capital assets, such as farm machinery and equipment, the capital cost is not allowed as an expense.  An allowance is made for the depreciation of these assets instead.  Where farm machinery or equipment is purchased outright, an allowance for depreciation relative to their usage is made.  There would be a cost to increase the depreciation to a standard rate of 10% which could only be considered in a budgetary context and would require a detailed analysis to provide an accurate costing.  Such a costing is not readily available.</p>  <p>  The annual Farm Assist Review is a necessary part of the normal review process. Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances to ensure that the assessment reflects the current situation accurately.  </p>  <p>  The Government made a commitment in the Programme for Government and in the Our Rural Future Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, to review the means assessment disregards for the Farm Assist scheme.  This technical review is underway and the report will be submitted to me shortly for consideration.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position at this time.</p></reply>

There were three measures under which organisations could apply: </p>  <p>  - Measure 1: Access to employment, self-employment and training/education supports for family carers </p>  <p>  - Measure 2: Initiatives to support and develop young carers</p>  <p>  - Measure 3:  Access to employment and self-employment for people with a disability</p>  <p>  Pobal is managing the process on behalf of my Department. A comprehensive appraisal process was undertaken by Pobal to review the eligibility and quality of applications received as well as financial management and governance. Applications were evaluated based on the measure specific guidelines determined by my Department and the general criteria applicable to Dormant Accounts Disbursements. </p>  <p>  In December 2020, I was pleased to announce a funding package in excess of &euro;2.3 million for the total of 17 projects who made an application under this measure. The delivery period for the successful applicants is from 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2022. </p>  <p>  The nature of the process and timing of this process can result in a variance between the expenditure outturn versus the original estimate. There is no way of predicting with any degree of accuracy the number of applications that will be received in relation to a call for proposals. As part of the competitive process organised by Pobal each of the applications is evaluated against a number of preset criteria, and successful organisations do not always receive the amount of funding sought in their application.</p>  <p>  The grantees are funded according to an agreed payment schedule. Pobal issue an initial payment on receipt of a signed grant agreement, with 90% initial funding provided for grants of less than &euro;50,000 and 60% for grants of more than &euro;50,000.  To date, a total of 58% or over &euro;1.38 million has been paid to grantees. </p>  <p>  As outlined above, the Dormant Accounts Fund 2020 Plan provided funding for two measures that focused on Family Carers and Young Carers. For the first measure, there were just four applicants and funding of &euro;378,075 was provided. A further single application was received as a joint application for both Measure 1 &amp;amp; 2 and funding of &euro;199,815 was requested and provided. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that additional funding requests amounting to &euro;380,153 were received by Pobal from two family carer representative organisations in 2021, both of which are currently in receipt of funding under the Dormant Accounts Fund 2020 Plan. A decision on the outcome of these applications will communicated to the organisations by Pobal shortly. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Those who are substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment arising from a medical condition may be eligible for the means-tested Disability Allowance, subject to meeting the relevant medical criteria. Recipients of both of these payments are eligible for the Christmas Bonus and, subject to satisfying all qualifying conditions, for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for Fuel Allowance or the Christmas Bonus to include people in receipt of Illness Benefit would have to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost, including exceptional heating costs, which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources.

The Strategy represents a whole of Government approach to bring about meaningful change and progress for the Traveller and Roma community in Ireland.  It brings Government Departments and Agencies together along with representatives of both Traveller and Roma communities to bring a focus to the issues which affect them most in a structured way.  </p><p>The NTRIS contains 149 actions, grouped under ten themes including Cultural Identity; Education; Employment; Health and Accommodation and aim to improve the lives of the Traveller and Roma Communities.  Progress on these actions is monitored by a Steering Committee which includes both Traveller and Roma representatives and Civil Society organisations. </p><p>The<b></b>Deputy will appreciate that while my Department has responsibility for coordinating the monitoring of the Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, each relevant Department has its own budget and is responsible for the implementation of its own commitments including cultural issues. </p><p>In 2021, my Department is providing &euro;4.925 million in funding to support Traveller and Roma inclusion.  This funding is being used to continue existing supports and to support new activities designed to counteract the impact of COVID-19 on the Traveller and Roma communities. In relation to DCEDIY cultural actions the position is as follows:</p><p><i>Review of Traveller Pride (TPW)</i></p><p>A Review of Traveller Pride Week and Traveller Pride Awards was completed in May of this year.  As a follow on from that review and stemming from recommendations therein, my Department agreed to provide further resources for this year&rsquo;s Traveller Pride events.  This is also in line with the commitment under Action 1 of NTRIS to expand Traveller Pride Week.  With that in mind, my Department provided a &euro;100,000 to support these national and local events. </p><p>Traveller Pride Week national events began on 20 September and local events took place in the week commencing 27 September, 2021. These events provides the Traveller and Roma Communities with an opportunity to promote Traveller and Roma culture, achievements and talents at both local and national level and celebrate that culture with the whole of Irish society as one community. The theme of this year&rsquo;s pride week was &lsquo;Stronger Together&rsquo;.  In light of COVID-19 restrictions, a number of live events and celebrations went ahead online, including panel discussions, a video series which showcased 3 past Traveller Pride Award recipients, music and traditional storytelling. </p><p><i>Additional funding for cultural initiatives</i></p><p>I was delighted to be able to support the production of an audio book, Dr Rosaleen McDonagh's collection of essays &quot;Unsettled&quot; which was funded to the amount of &euro;7,400.</p><p>Funds to the amount of &euro;30,563 is being provided to run a workshop with Traveller writers and to put in place fully paid fellowships for two Traveller writers on the &ldquo;Play It Forward Fellowship Programme&rdquo;. This fellowship offers the emerging writers 18-month of support to develop, showcase and publish their work.

One of TMS and TCS unique attributes is employing Travellers as mediators and counsellors which supports the increasing numbers of self-referrals coming from Travellers as Travellers feel those mediators and counsellors have a better understanding of the history or the underlying problems that non-Travellers might not consider relevant.  This is especially relevant in the case of trained female Traveller mediators helping female Travellers in the community as they have a unique connection.</p><p>International Roma Day falls on 8 April each year marking the day of the first World Roma Congress in 1971.

As this process is ongoing, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment at this stage. </p>  <p>  In recent years, funding for the provision of youth services has increased on an annual basis. Between the years 2016 and 2021 the annual current youth funding available to my Department has increased from &euro;51.9 million to &euro;66.79 million.</p>  <p>  It is now more critical than ever that our young people are supported as they experience the social, economic, physical and mental health impacts of the pandemic. In recognition of the vital role played by youthwork services in providing such support to young people, funding levels have been maintained throughout the current challenging period.  This has enabled the youth sector to continue to provide supports to young people, particularly to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.  </p>  <p>  As we begin to move beyond the pandemic I am committed to supporting this important sector, which has enormous value to the many young people involved and from a broader social and economic viewpoint. </p></reply>

The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy.</p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early learning and childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. My Department has, however, over a number of years provided a range of supports to service providers to enable them to improve wages and working conditions.</p>  <p>  I am committed to doing what is in my power to improve wages and working conditions. That is why last December I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC). In agreement with IBEC/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, I appointed Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, to be the independent chair of this process.</p>  <p>  On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector.</p>  <p>  In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, the Labour Court recommended establishment of a JLC, and Minister English accepted the Labour Court&rsquo;s recommendations. The Establishment Order came into effect at the beginning of July. The JLC will provide an opportunity for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine wages and working conditions for ELC and SAC. In addition, work on a Workforce Development Plan for ELC and SAC continues, with a final report expected by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Specifically on the question of sick pay, I believe, after a number of discussions with representative bodies in the sector, that sick pay for ELC and SAC practitioners should be addressed in the wider context of sick pay for all workers. On June 9th this year, the T&aacute;naiste announced details of the Government&rsquo;s plan to introduce legislation to give all workers the right to paid sick leave, initially starting with three days per year in 2022, rising to five days payable in 2023 and seven days payable in 2024. </p></reply>

It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years education and care in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios.</p>  <p>  Prior to September 2018 there were three entry points to ECCE.  This lead to a situation where there was variation in the number of ECCE weeks a child could qualify for, ranging from between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child. The introduction of a single entry point a aligned to the start of the primary school year ensured that all children could receive 2 full years of ECCE, or 76 weeks. This also ensures that all children can experience the full pre-school curriculum.</p>  <p>  A single entry point has also streamlined the administration process for providers, making it easier for them to operate and budget for the programme year. In addition it has made it easier parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children. </p></reply>

It will abolish the wards of court system for adults by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  Adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements on a phased basis over 3 years from the date of commencement.</p><p>The Government made a commitment in the Programme for Government to commencing the 2015 Act, recognising the importance of the much needed reform it represents.  We are working towards a date of June 2022 for full commencement of all remaining sections of the 2015 Act and establishment of the Decision Support Service immediately thereafter.  An inter-departmental steering group is meeting regularly to prepare for commencement of the Act.</p><p>The delays in commencement of the 2015 Act arise from two principal factors.  The Decision Support Service (DSS), which is the organisation that will operate the progressive provisions of the 2015 Act, has to become fully operational and be able to respond to the complex decision-making needs of people with capacity difficulties.  The DSS has made considerable progress in putting in place the administrative and IT systems needed to operate the 2015 Act.  To this end a budget of &euro;5.8 million was secured for the DSS for 2021, a significant increase on its &euro;3.5 million 2020 budget. </p><p>Amendments are also required to the 2015 Act before full commencement can take place.  Work is actively taking place on an Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which will address a number of issues required to streamline processes and improve safeguards for those who will rely on the provisions of the Act.  I expect to be in a position to publish a Bill by year-end, and to see it enacted next year.</p><p>The current status of the 2015 Act, outlining the sections already commenced and those that will be commenced in June 2022 following the passage of the required amending legislation, are summarised in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Section</th>       <th>Commencement status</th>       <th>Commencement Date</th>       <th>Relevant instrument</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1-2</td>       <td>Commenced</td>       <td>17 Oct 2016</td>       <td>S.I.

In addition, the Employment Equality Acts 1998 - 2015, prohibit discrimination on the grounds of disability in employment, including vocational training and work experience. The National Disability Inclusion Strategy provides a comprehensive framework for action to address the barriers faced by people with disabilities, including the importance of challenging attitudes to disability.  The Strategy is monitored by a Strategy Committee which includes representatives of disability organisations and of a wide range of Government Departments and key public bodies such as the HSE.</p>  <p>  In light of the existing statutory position and the wider work of my Department in addressing the barriers and challenges faced by people with disabilities, I have no plans to establish a commission or working group on the lines suggested by the Deputy. </p></reply>

Under the plan, the female craft apprentice bursary will be extended to all apprenticeship programmes with greater than 80% representation of a single gender during 2022.

It has the largest ever housing budget in the history of the State to transform our housing system, with in excess of &euro;20bn in funding through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency over the next five years to support these actions. The student accommodation sector is a subset of the broader housing market, and as such is impacted by many of the same factors affecting other parts of the housing market.  </p>  <p>  The National Student Accommodation Strategy is designed to ensure that there is an increased level of supply of purpose built student accommodation to reduce the demand for accommodation in the private rental sector by both domestic and international students attending our Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Several of the actions in this strategy centre around ensuring that HEIs have access to low-cost financing in order to support their building of student accommodation.</p>  <p>  One of these actions involved the introduction of legislation to empower the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to lend directly to HEIs for the development of student accommodation. This legislation was commenced in 2017, and so far three universities - TCD, UCC and UCD have had a total of &euro;157 million in loans approved by the HFA, which will provide more than 1,400 new student bed spaces.</p>  <p>  In June I, along with my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, announced that &euro;75 million of financing had been successfully sourced for the Council of Europe Bank for the building of student accommodation in universities.</p>  <p>  Housing For All contains a commitment to support technological universities to develop purpose-built student accommodation where such a requirement exists, through access to appropriate financing, and a specific action in relation to legislating to allow for Technological Universities to borrow from the Housing Finance Agency. My officials and I will continue to work with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to advance this.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is also engaging with all the universities, including the technological universities, to explore further options which may be available to increase the availability of student accommodation. </p></reply>

The Safe Return Plan can be accessed at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/bcd91-a-safe-return-to-on-site-further-and-higher-education-and-research/.</p>  <p>  The plan, which emerged following extensive discussions between university representatives, public health and other relevant stakeholders, provided a framework for higher education institutions to proceed with planning for a return to onsite campus learning that would be in line with public health guidance. In that context, institutions and providers are currently progressing with their own detailed planning and work for a comprehensive return to on-site activity. </p>  <p>  At a minimum, on-site activity will include laboratory teaching and learning, classroom based teaching and learning, tutorials, workshops, smaller lectures, research, return to work-spaces and access to libraries with appropriate protective measures in place. As part of the safe return to on-site learning, other on campus non-educational activities and facilities such as sports, bars, canteens, clubs and societies will operate in line with prevailing general public health advice for those activities. </p>  <p>  Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies, and the way in which the Plan will be implemented will vary from institution to institution. However, I do hope students can be accommodated by institutions for in person graduations in line with public health advice.</p>  <p>  All returning students have resumed onsite activity and first year students will commence next week. In line with their arrival, the Department has worked with the HSE to establish a number of pop-up vaccination centres across 11 different institutions to maximise uptake of vaccinations.

In line with the Programme for Government commitment to address the gap in postgraduate grants, from September 2021 the postgraduate fee grant increased from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and will give greater certainty for students in terms of supports. In addition, the fee grant income threshold increased from &euro;31,500 to  &euro;54,240 from September 2021.</p>  <p>  Postgraduate students who meet all of the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;5,915; the income threshold for this grant for the 2021/22 academic year is &euro;24,500. Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. </p>  <p>  Under the Student Grant Scheme 2020, a student in receipt of a postgraduate research award where the stipend portion of the award did not exceed &euro;16,000 could apply to the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) for financial assistance. The stipend portion to be disregarded increased to &euro;18,500 under the Student Grant Scheme 2021.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. To take forward this commitment I established a review of the Student Grant Scheme. This review is currently underway, and being conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants, under the direction of a steering group chaired by my Department and comprising a number of stakeholders. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the review will be completed later this year and will inform future priorities regarding the development of student grant policy, including in the context of forthcoming Estimates process for 2022. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, in July 2020 I announced a funding package of &euro;168m for the return to education which included a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation.

This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  I also announced enhanced funding of &euro;3.2 million for the Irish Research Council to better support postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers in Ireland across all disciplines. This will directly benefit close to 1,300 early-career researchers across our higher education and research system. The additional investment will fulfil the long-standing priority attached by the Council to improving the support for its funded postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers at the earliest opportunity. The Irish Research Council&rsquo;s postgraduate stipend will increase from &euro;16,000 to &euro;18,500 per annum and funding for its postdoctoral researchers is also increasing. The changes will benefit both existing and new Council awardees in 2021, effective from the beginning of January.  </p>  <p>  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

In assessing an application for the 2021/22 academic year, SUSI will have regard to the following qualifying criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant: </p>  <p>  2. Total reckonable income, after income disregards and Child Dependant Increase(s) are excluded, must not exceed &euro;24,500;3. As at 31st of December 2020, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in Schedule 2 of the Student Grant Scheme 2021.</p>  <p>  There are over 40 eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in the Student Grant Scheme that include such payments as the One Parent Family Payment, Carer's Allowance, Disability Allowance, Farm Assist and Jobseekers Allowance and Benefit where held for a specified period of time.  A student may qualify for the special rate of grant provided that a party to the student grant application (which in the case of a dependent student it includes his/her parents and the student themselves) is in receipt of one of the prescribed payments and the applicant meets the other conditions of the special rate of grant.</p>  <p>  The student grant scheme contains a number of qualifying thresholds for various grant values. Therefore, students who do not qualify for the special rate of grant may qualify for a different rate based on gross reckonable income.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. To take forward this commitment I established a review of the Student Grant Scheme. This review is currently underway, and being conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants, under the direction of a steering group chaired by my Department and comprising a number of stakeholders. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the review will be completed later this year and will inform future priorities regarding the development of student grant policy, including in the context of forthcoming Estimates process for 2022. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.

The Strategic Performance Agreements have supported the shift to a more strategic, integrated, quality and outcomes-focused approach in FET. </p>  <p>  The new National Development Plan (NDP) provides for a major step up in capital funding for the FET sector with an increase from less than &euro;20m last year to approximately &euro;100m by 2025. While the previous NDP marked a turning point with the introduction, for the first time, of a dedicated capital envelope for the FET sector, the new NDP will enable a transition to a more ambitious and strategic approach to the development of FET infrastructure. The new NDP will support the development of FET Colleges of the Future, to consolidate high quality provision in key locations, while retaining a strong community-based presence. Significant planning work and capacity development is required to underpin this major programme of FET investment, including by ETBs. My Department is working with SOLAS to build up the structures to enable strategic planning for a capital programme for the FET sector. </p></reply>

My predecessor as Minister for Justice, Mr Gerry Collins, responded to these allegations at the time and these matters were debated in the House. The debates can be viewed on the Oireachtas website. Similarly, the report of the &Oacute; Briain Committee, which considered the matter of serious allegations of ill-treatment of persons in Garda custody including the Amnesty report, and made a series of recommendations, is published on the Oireachtas website. </p>  <p>  I am informed that the Court of Appeal judgment referenced by the Deputy decided to exclude the admissibility of evidence obtained from persons in custody.  The Court ruled that the court of trial in the case, having regard to subsequent case law in the Supreme Court, could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statements made by the applicant were voluntarily made or that the  manner in which they were made satisfied the basic requirements of fairness, and therefore granted the appeal.  </p>  <p>  As I previously advised the Deputy, the events in question culminated in the overturning of the convictions of two persons in 1980 and a pardon for an individual in 1992, as well as compensation in the cases. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Justice Act 1984 was subsequently introduced to regulate the treatment of persons in Garda custody. </p></reply>

In this regard, my Department is currently in the process of scoping the review and it is expected that it will commence later this year. </p>  <p>  It is now over 40 years since the first civil legal aid scheme was launched in Ireland and over 25 years since the scheme was placed on a statutory footing following the enactment of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.</p>  <p>  The Legal Aid Board and the Civil Legal Aid Scheme it administers have served those of limited means well over those years. The Board&rsquo;s provision of legal advice and representation, as well as more recently its role in the Family Mediation Service, plays an important part in resolving family disputes. </p>  <p>  Since the enactment of the 1995 Act and the making of the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996, the Regulations relating to financial eligibility have been substantially revised on three occasions. </p>  <p>  It is recognised however, that demands on the Civil Legal Aid Scheme have grown and that in order to provide maximum benefit to those it was established to serve, a review of the Scheme is appropriate, not least in light of societal change in Ireland over recent years. We must also acknowledge the reality that the resources available to fund the Civil Legal Aid Scheme are not infinite. </p>  <p>  We must aim to ensure that those in most need and whose means are insufficient can continue to avail of the Civil Legal Aid Scheme to the maximum extent possible, consistent with their legal needs.</p>  <p>  The terms of reference for the review are still in the process of being finalised. However, it is my intention that there will be significant consultation. This will ensure that the insights of those from the non-governmental sector with experience of the Civil Legal Aid Scheme and its clients will be captured by the review. The review may also have scope to undertake research to enable a data informed approach to this important initiative. </p>  <p>  Ultimately the review should map out a future for the Civil Legal Aid Scheme, which in my view is one which will provide for a flexible service that has, as far as possible, the capacity and resources to respond to the priority legal assistance needs of those of insufficient means.</p></reply>

Reforming and modernising our licensing law is an important part of how we do that. </p>  <p>  On 15 September 2021, I received Government approval to draft the General Scheme of the Sale of Alcohol Bill 2021 to reform and modernise licensing laws in Ireland. We are delivering on the first stage of that commitment and setting a course for how we will do it.</p>  <p>  The outdated Licensing Acts, Registration of Clubs Acts, and the Public Dance Hall Act 1935, will all be repealed and replaced with updated and streamlined 21st century provisions relating to the sale, supply and consumption of alcohol in licensed premises and registered clubs. This will radically reform, streamline and simplify our licensing laws.</p>  <p>  The larger body of work on the consolidation and reform of the licensing laws is at an early stage of development and the reform of licensing law is a complex process. Any reforms will be developed with a supportive approach to businesses and the interests of public health, consumers and communities will be central to implementation. For this reason, it is my intention to engage constructively with stakeholders as that work progresses.</p>  <p>  Separately, on 15 September, Minister Catherine Martin published the Report and recommendations of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce, which I welcomed. The work of the Taskforce has included wide stakeholder engagement. Liquor licensing reform in general as well as Special Exemptions Orders was the subject of many submissions and presentations received by the Night-Time Economy Taskforce and has formed part of their deliberations.   </p>  <p>  The recommendation made by the Night-Time Economy Taskforce to review licence fees, including the Special Exemption Order fee, will be taken forward by my officials. It will require further consideration in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Courts Service.</p>  <p>  Separate to this review and the fees applicable to Special Exemption Orders, and in acknowledgement of the Covid restrictions, on 21 July 2021, it was announced that the Government had approved a waiver of specified court fees and excise duties for vintners for the second consecutive year. On 29 August, Minister Humphreys signed the District Court (Fees) (Amendment) Order 2021 to give effect to what was approved by Government:</p>  <p>  - to waive court fees relating to the renewal of specified pubs and other liquor licences in 2021; and</p>  <p>  - to waive excise and stamp duties associated with those court fees for 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition, Revenue has waived the excise duty on on-trade liquor licences renewals.</p>  <p>  These fees and excise duties have been waived again in 2021 to support vintners and other licensed premises. I know that the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on these businesses and Government is keen to support them in any way we can. The waiving of these fees and duties is an important signal of that support.</p>  <p>  Pubs, bars, nightclubs and restaurants are all benefitting from this measure, helping to stimulate economic activity and employment as the sector returns to activity in line with Government and public health recommendations.</p></reply>

This ensures that those who are found to be in need of our protection can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security.</p>  <p>  In the permission to remain element of the process, each case is given a detailed consideration on its individual merits under all of the prescribed headings.

The International Protection Office of my Department is also examining and implementing measures with a view to speeding up processing times and reducing the overall number of applicants in the protection process. These measures include training more staff to conduct interviews and complete reports, whilst also streamlining processes to assist in expediting applications in the medium to long term.</p>  <p>  My Department will, by October 2022 at the latest, commence a review of progress made in reducing and improving processing times and based on the outcome of that review, decide by the end of 2022, whether additional measures are required in order to ensure that the new system can come into operation without the overhang of any significant number of legacy cases. </p></reply>

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in line with the eligibility criteria set out under the Act.  A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation, can only be made after an application is received. </p>  <p>  The Act requires that, any person, prior to making an application for naturalisation, has five years reckonable residence in the State, except for spouses of Irish nationals where the requirement is three years. In both cases, the final 12 months must be continuous residence in the State with up to six weeks absence currently allowed to facilitate foreign travel for business, family or holiday purposes. In June, when announcing the publication of the General Scheme of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, I confirmed that the continuous residence requirement will be amended to allow for total absences of up to 70 days from the State in the year preceding the citizenship application being made. Up to a further 30 days may also be allowed where necessitated by exceptional circumstances.</p>  <p>  All applicants for a certificate of naturalisation must supply original passports in support of their applications due to the requirement for applicants to firmly establish their identity. The requirement to supply original, in date and valid passports applies to all applicants. In rare circumstances, where an applicant cannot produce their current passport, the applicant will be required to provide a full explanation.

Part 8 of the 2009 Act introduced changes to the law concerning prescriptive easements, including rights of way, based on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  </p>  <p>  A prescriptive easement is a right acquired by long use, as of right, by a property owner over a neighbour&rsquo;s land, which is not granted in any surviving title deed.  Common examples are rights to access a farm or dwelling house, where the access laneway is privately owned by one or more neighbours. </p>  <p>  Public rights of way, or rights contained in written title deeds, are not affected. </p>  <p>  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, as amended in 2011, introduced a new requirement for these rights based on long use to be verified (by a court order, or an uncontested application for registration), and registered with the Property Registration Authority (PRA). Up to 30 November 2021, this could be done based on the existing legal rules on establishing long use. After that date, registration would still be possible, but only under new legal rules. </p>  <p>  I have consulted with a range of stakeholders, including the Law Society, Bar Council, Law Reform Commission and the Property Registration Agency, and listened carefully to the concerns raised. It is clear that there remains legal uncertainty about how the new rules may be interpreted, and that it has not yet been possible to register many important rights of way, which appear to have been enjoyed for many years without dispute. These problems are causing significant delays in conveyancing, and in loan applications.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that, if not addressed, this deadline was likely to lead to unnecessary litigation between neighbours, causing needless stress and legal costs. That is why I am acting quickly to address the legal uncertainty that has arisen.</p>  <p>  As an interim solution, on 21 September, I secured Cabinet approval for a short amending Bill, to be enacted before the November deadline. Consistent with the strong preference indicated by stakeholders, the Bill will remove the major changes to the law on prescriptive rights that were due to take effect after 30 November, thus removing and not extending the upcoming deadline. This is also expected to greatly reduce current conveyancing blockages.</p>  <p>  It is clear that more comprehensive reform may be needed, and I have therefore also obtained agreement to set up a time bound review that will identify the best long-term, sustainable provisions for the law in this area. </p>  <p>  I very much hope that the forthcoming urgent Bill will enjoy cross-party support in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

The Scheme provided, for the first time, a framework for the employment of non-EEA SeaFishers within defined segments of the Irish fishing fleet.  </p><p>The Scheme was welcomed as a solution to the risk of exploitation and to guarantee employment rights and protections to non-EEA SeaFishers availing of the Scheme. </p><p>The Scheme is monitored by an Oversight Committee chaired by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Any abuses or otherwise of the employment conditions in the Irish fishing industry is a matter for the Workplace Relations Commission, the Marine Survey Office, and other appropriate authorities of the State. </p><p>The application process for permission under the AWS for SeaFishers includes the drawing up of a contract which includes: the 12 month duration of the contract; payment of wages in line with the national minimum wage; that the medical needs of the employee must be provided for by the employer; and when an employment is terminated that the employer must repatriate the employee to their home country. This contract, prepared by a solicitor practising in the State on behalf of the employer, is submitted in the first instance to the Central Depository administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and thereafter an application is made to my Department for an immigration permission. </p><p>The role of my Department is to grant an immigration permission on the basis of the terms, conditions and workforce caps set by other Government Departments via the 2015 Task Force Report. My Department does not engage with the industry to determine future requirements. The review of labour force requirements sourced from within the EEA or otherwise in any sector is under the remit of the relevant Government Department with oversight responsibility for that sector.</p><p>The Scheme commenced in February 2016 and was initially only open to Non-EEA crew members who were already working in the fishing industry in Ireland.  From July of that year, all non-EEA workers intending to work in the fishing industry were required to obtain an Atypical Worker Permission (Stamp 1 conditions) from my Department and a visa clearance, if applicable, prior to entering the State. </p><p>It also provides for the annual renewal of the permission granted and permits the employee to transfer employment within the sector. However, the permission granted is not transferable to any other employment sector within the State.  </p><p>The table below sets out the breakdown by nationality of permissions granted each year under the Scheme since it commenced in February 2016. <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Year </b></th>       <th><b>Total granted</b></th>       <th><b>Philippines</b></th>       <th><b>Egypt</b></th>       <th><b>Indonesia</b></th>       <th><b>Ghana</b></th>       <th><b>Other</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>181</td>       <td>69</td>       <td>89</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>136</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>58</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>196</td>       <td>95</td>       <td>62</td>       <td>20</td>       <td></td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>213</td>       <td>103</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>183</td>       <td>94</td>       <td>44</td>       <td></td>       <td>25</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 to date</td>       <td>167</td>       <td>77</td>       <td>34</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>With the exception of confirming that the application is made from outside the State if it is a new permission, my Department does not collate information regarding the location of the application.</p><p>Neither does my Department collate information regarding the home port of vessels. Information regarding vessels on which permission has been granted to work is provided on a regular basis to relevant stakeholders in other Departments and Agencies with responsibility for monitoring the fishing fleet such as the Workplace Relations Commission, the Marine Safety Office, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>

The legal framework which assists the Garda&iacute; in tackling this type of crime includes provisions under the Criminal Damage Act 1991; the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994; the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003; and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 and 2008.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the compilation and publication of all crime statistics.

I am further advised that a significant and disproportionate amount of Garda resources would be required to fulfil the Deputy&rsquo;s request for data regarding nearly seven years, and that, in light of the complexities outlined above, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not in a position to provide the information sought by the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid-19 disruption and the inability to hold in person ceremonies during this time, has resulted in the processing timeline for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  As a result, regrettably, the current average processing time for applications is 23 months and there are just over 22,200 applications currently on hand. These applications are at various stages of processing, ranging from those just received to those where a decision has been made and are "ceremony ready". </p>  <p>  As of 1 October 2021, the number of applicants waiting for more than 12 months is 8,742; and the number of applicants waiting more than 24 months is 6,437.</p>  <p>  Aside from these specific issues, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with my Department. </p>  <p>  In some instances, the input of several Government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.   </p>  <p>  For applicants that were in the final stages of processing, in January, my Department opened a temporary system to enable these applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Since then, my Department has delivered on its commitment to communicate with 6,500 applicants by the end of June, inviting them to complete the final steps required prior to the granting of a certificate of naturalisation. </p>  <p>  Almost 6,200 certificates of naturalisation have been issued so far this year and a further 1,000 people have paid the statutory fee and will receive their certificates in the coming weeks. The Citizenship Division of my Department has prioritised bringing the oldest applications on hand to conclusion and a significant number of these applicants have received their certificates of naturalisation since the introduction of the temporary process.</p>  <p>  My Department intends to communicate with approximately 11,000 applicants up to the end of this year, in the context of issuing a decision on their applications. As the Deputy will appreciate, when an approval letter issues to an applicant there are certain administrative and financial commitments required of the applicant prior to the issuing of a naturalisation certificate. Currently, there are approximately 1,000 cases where approval letters have issued but the applicant has yet to respond. </p></reply>

As Minister for Justice, I have no direct role in these matters.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the table below sets out the estimated payroll cost in 2022 of increasing the number of sworn Garda&iacute; to 15,300 by the end of 2022; the estimated cost in 2023 to increase the number to 16,180; and the estimated cost in 2024 to increase the number of sworn Garda&iacute; to 17,100. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that cost is not the only constraint and annual recruitment levels are also subject to the capacity of the Garda College. The maximum intake of the College is dependent on a number of variables including funding, human resources, the availability of successful candidates and the chosen training delivery model. <table>    <tr>       <th>Estimated Increase </th>       <th>2022 </th>       <th>2023 </th>       <th>2024</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Estimated Pay Cost to Increase Numbers to 15,300 by end 2022</td>       <td>&euro;22m</td>       <td>&euro;45m</td>       <td>&euro;48m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Estimated Pay Cost to Increase Numbers to 16,180 by end 2023</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;21m</td>       <td>&euro;43m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Estimated Pay Cost to Increase Numbers to 17,100 by end 2024</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;22m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Estimated Payroll Costs</td>       <td>&euro;22m</td>       <td>&euro;66m</td>       <td>&euro;113m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The above figures are estimates only as the costing of the increase in numbers must take account of a number of uncertainties.

This includes Garda members moving to the first point of the pay scale when attested and an estimation of allowances that the members may qualify for depending on their assignments and employer&rsquo;s PRSI. The workings assume that each member moves to Point 2 of the pay scale one year post attestation and point 3 of the pay scale two years post attestation. </p><p>The estimate covers the period of training and subsequent years of employment to end 2024. </p><p>The estimate is based on current work schedules and pay scales, with the impact of scheduled pay rises in October 2021 and October 2022 taken into consideration. </p><p>It is important to note that the annual payroll costs would continue to increase as the members move up the Garda pay scale each year. </p><p>It should also be noted that the estimated figures do not take account of potential overtime costs in excess of estimated briefing time payments.  </p></reply>

The Programme for Government endorses this approach as an important step in developing a public health-led approach to drug use.</p>  <p>  The aim of the health diversion programme is to connect people who use drugs with health services and provide a pathway to recovery, thereby avoiding a criminal conviction. The programme will offer compassion, not punishment, to people who use drugs.  Under the programme, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will divert a person found in possession of drugs for personal use to the HSE for a health screening and brief intervention.</p>  <p>  The Health Diversion Programme is aligned with the strategic priority in the EU Drugs Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2025 to provide alternatives to coercive sanctions for people who use drugs. The strategy proposes q stepping up efforts to mainstream and implement alternatives to coercive sanctions, for drug using offenders and for people arrested, charged with or convicted for drug-related offences or people found in possession of drugs for personal use. The strategy also outlines that more comprehensive and in-depth data and exchange of best practices between member States is needed in this area. </p>  <p>  An implementation group chaired by the Department of Health is finalising plans for the commencement of the Health Diversion Programme. The group is currently considering legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the implementation of the Health Diversion Programme on an administrative basis. It is also considering the formal views of the Garda Commissioner. Certain legal, procedural and logistical issues need to be clarified before the rollout of the programme can commence. The Department of Health is consulting with the Department of Justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on these issues.</p>  <p>  As committed to in the Programme for Government, the programme will be reviewed after the first full year of implementation to ensure that it is meeting all of it aims and to make any necessary changes.</p>  <p>  I look forward to the commencement of the Health Diversion Programme, which will demonstrate a health-led approach in how we deal with people who use drugs. </p></reply>

A major landmark was reached in the implementation of this action through the implementation of the national programme of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) treatment by the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP).  </p>  <p>  PrEP is now being delivered in a phased manner through approved services that meet the National Standards for PrEP Service Delivery. There are currently thirteen public and nine private approved PrEP service providers in Ireland; details are available through the following link: www.sexualwellbeing.ie/getprep . Full funding of &euro;5.4 million was secured for PrEP in 2020 and for subsequent years, including allocations for the recruitment of additional staff.</p>  <p>  Whilst the PrEP programme remains fully funded, implementation has been impacted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. All health services, including STI/HIV/PrEP services, are continuing to face constraints, resulting from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. These include attendance by appointment only, or online as a result of the need to maintain social distancing, and the necessary redeployment of personnel to diverse COVID-19 related duties, which include testing, contact tracing, vaccination and front-line patient care. </p>  <p>  Despite significant service restrictions in 2020/21 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, PrEP services continued to see new and review existing PrEP service users. Many services adapted how they worked, delivering some care on a virtual platform. </p>  <p>  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the HSE SHCPP has been in regular communication with public STI/PrEP services and community partners, and is working together with HIV Ireland to maintain an updated list of service availability. Information for users on how to access services is available here: www.hivireland.ie/wp-content/uploads/Sexual-Health-Service-Restrictions.pdf.</p>  <p>  Services have been working hard to restore and increase service capacity throughout 2021 notwithstanding the challenges faced by the ongoing pandemic, the recent cyber-attack and, most recently, a national Early Infectious Syphilis outbreak.</p>  <p>  The Paris Declaration referred to by the Deputy is a commitment made by cities participating in the Fast Track Cities global initiative to scale up their local responses to HIV. Ireland joined this initiative in 2019 with initial funding of &euro;450K provided to the HSE, to support commencement of the initiative in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick. </p>  <p>  Fast Track Cities implementation includes expanded community HIV testing and outreach in key urban centres, targeted outreach to key at-risk groups, public campaigns on stigma reduction and promotion of the PrEP programme, and development of a co-ordination, monitoring and evaluation workstream. Steering groups, which include representation from my Department and the HSE SHCPP, have been established and are now in place, working to progress this initiative in the participating cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. </p></reply>

The GMHS website and other resources such as www.man2man.ie  and www.sexualwellbeing.ie are regularly updated to reflect current service delivery and to signpost users to the HSE list of approved STI and PrEP services.</p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to progress a number of initiatives that aim to reduce the level of HIV and STIs nationally and improve access to services for those in need as follows:</p>  <p>  - The promotion of safer sex messages to the public via a range of social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</p>  <p>  - During the pandemic, the public has been advised about STI clinic restrictions and encouraged to consider safer sexual practices to reduce the risk of HIV and STI transmission.</p>  <p>  - Guidance has been issued around sex and COVID-19 which advised the public to limit numbers of partners to reduce transmission of HIV/STIs as well as COVID-19 during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  - Those who are symptomatic are advised to contact a clinic directly for an emergency appointment.</p>  <p>  - Condoms are freely available to NGO partners and service providers via the National Condom Distribution (NCDS) service.</p>  <p>  - A number of NGOs have established postal services to make condoms and lubricant accessible to service-users throughout the pandemic while venues were closed.</p>  <p>  - Ireland joined the HIV Fast-Track Cities Initiative in 2019; the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway are current members of HIV Fast Track Cities; implementation of the initiative is progressing, with HIV FTC Steering Groups now in place for each of the four cities. </p>  <p>  - Free rapid HIV testing is available in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick through community NGO partners HIV Ireland, Sexual Health Centre Cork, Sexual Health West and GOSHH. NGO partners have adapted their services and are currently providing free rapid HIV testing from their offices or alternative venues.</p>  <p>  - STI/HIV testing is currently available through a HSE home STI testing pilot project in Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare, Cork and Kerry (funded by the Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund). This pilot commenced in early 2021, in Dublin, Cork and Kerry initially, overseen by the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme through SH24.</p>  <p>  - As a result of high demand, and in response to the pressures imposed by a public health declared early infectious syphilis outbreak, the HSE SHCPP in consultation with my Department, have extended the pilot to additional areas (Kildare, Meath and Wicklow) and for an additional time period. The possibility of further expansion is being scoped currently, given the need for the service and its success in reaching cohorts that are typically underrepresented amongst those presenting in person at STI clinics.  </p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have also asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Eating Disorders Model of Care was launched in 2018 and was developed in partnership with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and Bodywhys, the national support group for people with eating disorders.</p>  <p>  &euro;1.77 million has been invested to date in eating disorder specialist posts, with 21.8 WTEs now in place. In addition, &euro;3.94m was allocated in 2021 to enable further investment in specialist posts throughout this year. More specifically, it will allow for the establishment of 3 new specialist eating disorder teams and the completion of the 3 existing specialist teams. Premises are already under development for the expansion of the adult community team at the Mount Carmel site and is expected to be completed by the end 2021. Recruitment is progressing well for all teams.</p>  <p>  The funding allocated to date has seen significant growth and improvement in our services. Despite the significant increase in referrals in 2020, there was a 43% increase in the number of eating disorder assessments completed, compared to 2019, with twice as many people starting treatment.</p>  <p>  As of last year, there are 3 specialist eating disorder teams in place. This means that we can treat over 90% of people with eating disorders in the community, avoiding more serious inpatient treatment.</p>  <p>  There are currently 2 eating disorder specialist community teams based in CAMHS, one in CHO4 Cork and Kerry Regional Eating Disorder Service CAREDS (operational since May 2019) and the other based in CHO 7 Linn Dara Community Eating Disorder Service LDCEDS (operational since April 2018). Funding has been made available in 2021 to progress the recruitment of an additional CAMHS based eating disorder specialist community team in Community Healthcare West (Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, CHO2).</p>  <p>  Specialist outpatient treatment has been found to be the most effective and fastest way for most people with eating disorders to recover. Although there is good evidence that inpatient psychiatric care is not required for most people with eating disorders, it is recognised that a small number of people, mainly with restrictive eating disorders, require inpatient care for short periods, for structured refeeding and/or stabilisation.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where in-patient care is required, child and adolescent care is provided in all of the 4 Regional CAMHS Units across the country. Linn Dara (8 beds) and Merlin Park (6 beds) have dedicated a number of specialist eating disorder beds, while the remaining 2 CAMHS units accept relevant admissions of children with eating disorders. There is national coordination of child and adolescent admissions, with transfer arrangements in place as required by individual clinical need.</p>  <p>  There are plans for an Eating Disorder Unit in the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital which will provide 8 additional beds. The HSE also funds individuals in private facilities. Decisions are made based on individual clinical need, as assessed by the local mental health team, and the prioritisation of available funding.</p>  <p>  For adults, people who require in-patient care are admitted to local general adult approved centres and attend generic inpatient treatment programmes. CHO6 has 3 dedicated beds for eating disorders based in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital. The number of adult beds will increase, in line with the National Clinical Programme, including an additional 3 beds in St. Vincent's, 5 beds in North Dublin, 5 beds in Galway and 5 beds in Cork. Timeframes for new beds will have to be established. These beds will be linked to eating disorder hubs. The funding available for 2021 will allow for the creation of 2 new adult eating disorder hubs in CHO4 and CHO9.</p>  <p>  Importantly, adults with eating disorders can also access treatment from local community mental health teams. There are currently 112 adult community mental health teams nationwide. Children and adolescents can similarly access treatment through the 72 CAMHS teams units nationwide.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding annually to Bodywhys to run a helpline which is delivered by a team of trained volunteers.

To advance this, the Government is committed to establishing a new, statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services, which the Department of Health is currently developing.</p><p>It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs. Work is on-going within the Department to progress the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms. This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery for home support services.</p><p>With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (regulations); and HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services. </p><p>Government gave approval earlier this year to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined.  </p><p>In parallel to this, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for home support. Within this context, funding was allocated in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; the pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and the establishment of a National Office for Home Support Services.</p><p>The pilot of a reformed model of service-delivery is expected to commence in November and will deliver an additional 230,000 hours of home-support in four community healthcare network (CHN) sites over a six-month period. The pilot sites are: (CHO 2) Tuam, Athenry and Loughrea (CHO 4) Bandon, Kinsale and Carrigaline (CHO 7) Ballyfermot and Palmerstown (CHO 8) East Westmeath. The pilot is expected to last 6 months. The evaluation will capture the key findings of the project, which will inform the development of the service-delivery model for the new scheme. In addition, approximately 130 posts have been funded for the national rollout of the interRAI Ireland system as the standard assessment tool for care-needs. </p><p>The <i>Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy and Action Plan 2021&ndash;2023</i>commits to the advancement of the development of the new home-support scheme in 2021 and to the commencement of its implementation in 2022. While the new home-support scheme is under development, the Government is prioritising improving access to home-support services. As part of Budget 2021, funding for an additional 5 million hours of home-support was provided. This increased investment will contribute to meeting the <i>Programme for Government</i>commitment to providing equitable access to home-support services.</p></reply>

In that context, all persons ordinarily resident in Ireland are eligible for public hospital services. In addition, patients may opt for private in-patient care in public hospitals subject to the requirement that the proportion of private activity is public hospitals should in the main be limited to 20% of total activity and private patient charges are set to recoup the cost of the hospital services provided to private patients.</p><p>Section 55 of the Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides that the HSE may make available private in-patient services to persons who do not have or have waived their eligibility to, public in-patient services.  These services include accommodation, non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing staff, medicines, blood, medical and surgical supplies, radiology, diagnostics, operating theatres, laboratories, administration and support staff. It is also noted that patients opting to be treated privately must also pay the consultant fees associated with their treatment. The cost of a private patient stay is largely influenced by these staffing and operational costs rather than the room type occupied. </p><p>The statutory hospital charges under Section 55 that apply for such an episode of care is set out in the table below and depends on the category of hospital, duration of stay and whether the accommodation was provided in a single or multi-occupancy room.

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone, and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021, which was signed into law on 22 July, introduced further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses. The principal amendment of this Act ensures that where the owners of farms and businesses go into long-term residential care, their contributions against those assets will be capped at 3 years, providing that a named family successor commits to running the asset for a period of six years and certain other conditions are met.</p><p>It also includes an amendment in relation to applying the 3-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a house while a resident is in long-term care. This addresses the first relevant commitment in the <i>Housing for All </i>Strategy (action 19.7).</p><p>Within the NHSS, the asset value of a resident's home, known in the Scheme as the &quot;principal residence&quot;, is assessed for 3 years, with 7.5% of its value going towards the cost of care (3.75% in the case of a couple). After 3 years on the scheme, the value of this property is no longer assessed. In practice, this generally reduces the nursing home fees of those maintaining their home, from year four onwards. However, under previous rules, if it was sold, the resulting cash asset was assessable in full for the entire length of stay in care. This could act as a disincentive for those who might otherwise consider selling their homes. The 2021 Act now extends the 3-year cap to cover the proceeds of sale, so that a person will be able to sell their home without incurring additional fees from the fourth year onwards. The timeline set out in the legislation ensures that the Act will be operational by the 20 October 2021. In the development of the legislative amendment, it was projected that this change would bring between 330 and 580 homes to market each year, on average 2.25 years earlier than if sold when the resident left care.</p><p>As well as introducing the change above, the Department of Health has also agreed to action 19.8 in the <i>Housing for All </i>Strategy to develop a mechanism in relation to the rental of vacant properties in a way that is &quot;targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people&quot;. It is important to note that complex policy questions remain in meeting these criteria and there are high risks associated with unintended consequences. There is no existing exemption of rental or similar income from assessment within the Scheme and due care needs to be taken to ensure that any changes are appropriate, to protect and meet the needs of residents while also making provision for those in need of housing.</p><p>The NHSS is a complex &euro;1.4 billion Scheme that relies on &euro;350m of contributions from over 22,000 residents. It is important to ensure that the costs, benefits, and unintended consequences of any policy changes are fully understood and resolved before they are put in place.</p><p>The Department of Health and Department for Housing, Local Government and Heritage continue to collaborate on this policy, including the identification of the number of houses that may be brought into use and the costs associated with the policy options available to address this action, with a view to introducing legislation as soon as possible once this analysis and policy development is complete.</p></reply>

These recommendations recognise the very significant impact of the previous testing and tracing requirements on children in these settings. The changes which came into effect on 27 September 2021 are as follows:</p>  <p>  - Automatic contact tracing of close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities).</p>  <p>  - Testing of asymptomatic close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities).</p>  <p>  - Children aged 12 yrs or under, who are identified as close contacts in childcare, educational settings, special education settings or other non-household settings and who are asymptomatic will no longer be required to restrict movements, unless indicated by the local public health team.</p>  <p>  - Children aged 12 yrs or under who are identified as household close contacts in household settings will still be required to restrict movements and get tested, regardless of symptomatic status.</p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the public health advice remains that any child aged 12 yrs or under who displays symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should rapidly self-isolate and not attend school or socialise until 48 hours after they are symptom free.</p>  <p>  Further information is available in the Guidance for COVID-19 Contact Tracing for Children (>3 months to under 13 years of age) published by the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre, available at www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/educationguidance/Contact%20tracing%20under%2013s.pdf</p>  <p>  The recommendations which have come into effect are based on what has been learned throughout the pandemic, primarily</p>  <p>  - Children seem more likely than adults to have no symptoms or to have mild disease</p>  <p>  - Investigation of cases identified in school settings suggests that child to child transmission in schools is uncommon and not the primary cause of Sars-CoV-2 infection in children, particularly in pre-school and primary educational settings</p>  <p>  - Children are rarely identified as the route of transmission of infection into the household setting</p>  <p>  - Children are not more likely than adults to spread infection to other people.</p>  <p>  On that basis, from a public health perspective there is no clinical need for information to be routinely shared with contacts of cases and Public Health do not recommend telling parents of other children that there has been a case of COVID 19 within a class or group. Sharing of health data relating to positive cases in the manner envisaged in the question should only be done on the advice of Public Health and according to the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations. Since the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations no longer apply in this instance, it is important to note the importance of an individual&rsquo;s confidentiality not being broken by others, in line with normal GDPR requirements. It is important that families are aware of the need to ensure they do not send children in to school and childcare facilities or to participate in activities if the child has new symptoms consistent with COVID 19. In these circumstances they should observe their child and contact their GP as appropriate. It is also important to regularly re-enforce the benefit to all of continuing to abide by infection prevention control and mitigation measures in place within school and childcare facilities.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the changes in guidance outlined above do not apply to special educational needs (SEN) schools or SEN-specific classes or children attending respite care. In these circumstances close contacts amongst children may well still be identified and asked to restrict their movements, following a Public Health Risk Assessment conducted by a public health doctor. However, close contacts will generally be requested only to restrict their movements for 5 days and be referred for one COVID-19 test. This is to balance the observation period required for children for signs of infection, with testing at the most relevant time, whilst not prolonging restricted movements and the harms to children from these restrictions.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists. </p><p>My Department is working with the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to develop plans to tackle the rise in waiting lists.  Firstly, with the finalisation of a short-term Waiting List Action Plan which will cover the rest of the year, until December 2021. Secondly through the development of a longer-term Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy concerning the waiting time for respiratory patients, is outlined in the attached document.</p><p>Galway University Hospital Respiratory Medicine Outpatient Waiting List <table>    <tr>       <th>Values</th>       <th>0-3Months</th>       <th>3-6Months</th>       <th>6-9Months</th>       <th>9-12Months</th>       <th>12-15Months</th>       <th>15-18Months</th>       <th>18-21Months</th>       <th>21-24Months</th>       <th>24-36Months</th>       <th>36-48Months</th>       <th>Grand Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Current </td>       <td>376</td>       <td>290</td>       <td>209</td>       <td>220</td>       <td>152</td>       <td>124</td>       <td>195</td>       <td>177</td>       <td>457</td>       <td>144</td>       <td>2344</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  At the request of my Department, the HIQA are conducting a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on a school based HPV mop-up vaccination programme (for those that were previously eligible and missed or turned down the vaccine). The HIQA has confirmed that this HTA has been added to its work programme for 2021/2022 and I have requested that my officials give consideration to the outcome of this work in the context of the immunisation programme.</p></reply>

The service has grown over the years in line with the national oncology services.</p>  <p>  Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the Oncology day ward services were delivered on half a ward on the third floor of the main hospital building. Following a risk assessment with the onset of the pandemic,  the day ward service was temporarily re-housed in the Palliative Care day ward. This was never envisaged to be a long-term solution and UHK had linked with HSE Estates to plan for a dedicated Oncology Development on-site, incorporating both Oncology day services and OPD. This process is at planning stage and UHK has also collaborated with the local &lsquo;Comfort for Chemo Kerry&rsquo; charity organisation seeking their support and input.</p>  <p>  It is accepted that approval, planning and construction/fitting out of a dedicated unit on the UHK campus will take some time, and it is also acknowledged that the Palliative Care Day Ward service requires access to their unit again.  In these circumstances, UHK has linked with the Bon Secours Hospital Tralee (BSHT), to provide temporary accommodation.  Plans are now at an advanced stage to move the day ward service to a unit on the BSHT campus when it is refurbished. The service will continue to be fully staffed by HSE/UHK personnel at the new location. OPD services will remain at UHK.  Both the National Cancer Control Programme and SSWHG are fully supportive of this plan.</p></reply>

These recommendations recognise the very significant impact of the previous testing and tracing requirements on children in these settings. The changes which came into effect on 27 September 2021 are as follows:</p><p>- Automatic contact tracing of close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities).</p><p>- Testing of asymptomatic close contacts in childcare facilities and primary education will be discontinued (not including special education facilities).</p><p>- Children aged 12 yrs or under, who are identified as close contacts in childcare, educational settings, special education settings or other non-household settings and who are asymptomatic will no longer be required to restrict movements, unless indicated by the local public health team.</p><p>- Children aged 12yrs or under who are identified as household close contacts in household settings will still be required to restrict movements and get tested, regardless of symptomatic status.</p><p>It is important to reiterate that the public health advice remains that any child aged 12yrs or under who displays symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should rapidly self-isolate and not attend school or socialise until 48 hours after they are symptom free.</p><p>Further information is available in the Guidance for COVID-19 Contact Tracing for Children (&amp;gt;3 months to under 13 years of age) published by the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre, available at <i>www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/educationguidance/Contact%20tracing%20under%2013s.pdf</i></p><p>The recommendations which have come into effect are based on what has been learned throughout the pandemic, primarily</p><p>- Children seem more likely than adults to have no symptoms or to have mild disease</p><p>- Investigation of cases identified in school settings suggests that child to child transmission in schools is uncommon and not the primary cause of Sars-CoV-2 infection in children, particularly in pre-school and primary educational settings</p><p>- Children are rarely identified as the route of transmission of infection into the household setting</p><p>- Children are not more likely than adults to spread infection to other people.</p><p>On that basis, from a public health perspective there is no clinical need for information to be routinely shared with contacts of cases and Public Health do not recommend telling parents of other children that there has been a case of COVID 19 within a class or group. Sharing of health data relating to positive cases in the manner envisaged in the question should only be done on the advice of Public Health and according to the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations. Since the provisions of the Infectious Disease Regulations no longer apply in this instance, it is important to note the importance of an individual&rsquo;s confidentiality not being broken by others, in line with normal GDPR requirements. It is important that families are aware of the need to ensure they do not send children in to school and childcare facilities or to participate in activities if the child has new symptoms consistent with COVID 19. In these circumstances they should observe their child and contact their GP as appropriate. It is also important to regularly re-enforce the benefit to all of continuing to abide by infection prevention control and mitigation measures in place within school and childcare facilities.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the changes in guidance outlined above do not apply to special educational needs (SEN) schools or SEN-specific classes or children attending respite care. In these circumstances close contacts amongst children may well still be identified and asked to restrict their movements, following a Public Health Risk Assessment conducted by a public health doctor. However, close contacts will generally be requested only to restrict their movements for 5 days and be referred for one COVID-19 test.

I understand that four pilot sites were put in place in CHOs 4, 6, 7 and 9; three of these CMSUs are partially established and one is fully established. Currently, an Implementation Group is working with representatives from all the above mentioned CHOs to develop the CMSU processes. Among the key responsibilities of the CMSUs is to ensure that:</p><p>- Service Agreements (SAs) and Grant Aid Agreements (GAs) are finalised and completed in respect of all Providers that are in receipt of annual funding and that the service provider governance (SPG) system is updated in this regard </p><p>- Annual Financial Statements and Annual Financial Monitoring Returns are both received and reviewed at local level in a timely manner </p><p>- Regular performance review meetings are held in accordance with the requirements of Guidelines for Performance Management for SAs and GAs </p><p>- Key documents such as the Business Plan, Chairperson&rsquo;s Statement, Management Accounts and Activity Data are received and reviewed as appropriate.</p><p>Having reviewed the pilot sites the HSE determined that due to the higher concentration of voluntary body headquarters in the areas covered by CHOs 7 and 9, that they would be assigned an additional Financial Analyst post each in order to have sufficient capacity to deal with the additional workload.CHOs 3, 5 and 8 have also commenced developing their CMSUs. Central to the establishment of the CMSUs is the appointment of the CMSU Managers at Grade VIII level in each of the nine CHOs. To date, 8 of the 9 CMSU managers have been appointed. The remaining CMSU manager post has been accepted and will start in October 2021. Of the 38 whole time equivalent positions approved, 17 are in post, 7 are appointed and are due to start by the end of October and 14 posts are still in the recruitment process.</p></reply>

Disability service provision is based on the needs of the individual, rather than the provision of services based on a specific disability diagnosis. It is noted however that eligibility for the HSE Mobility Allowance, which closed to new applicants in 2013, and Supplementary Blind Welfare Allowance is means tested. </p>  <p>  Regarding other HSE supports such as the medical card, under the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is based primarily on means. The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. However, since 2017, all children for whom a Domiciliary Care Allowance (a monthly payment for a child with a severe disability) is paid automatically qualify for a medical card without a financial assessment.</p>  <p>  As the assessment processes to determine eligibility for a medical card, the Mobility Allowance and Supplementary Blind Welfare Allowance are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly on these issues, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department and from the HSE are currently engaging with the Irish Dental Association on matters relating to the DTSS, including the proposed review.</p></reply>

The increased level of funding in 2021 will enable us to build on initiatives currently underway, including the decongregation programme, with a renewed focus on assisting people to move out of congregated settings to homes in the community. The HSE has prioritised the transition of a further 144  people from congregated settings in 2021 under its Service Plan.</p><p>As the numbers in the large settings continues to fall, the people still remaining in these services have access to better living conditions and share with fewer people. </p><p>The position of the HSE is that it wishes to see all individuals supported to have the option of living independently in the community provided this is in their best interests and in partnership with their families.

The public record of the meeting referred to by the Deputy does not contain reference to a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners. </p>  <p>  Tax compliance is in the first instance the responsibility of bodies under the aegis of my Department themselves, and details of any settlements, investigations, etc are made available in their Annual Financial Statements, as appropriate. </p>  <p>  In each of the past five years, the HSE has carried out a significant self-review of tax compliance with external specialist tax assistance. These self-reviews are conducted on an agreed risk based assessment with Revenue under their cooperative compliance framework. The level of review for 2019 was impacted by COVID-19 staffing requirements, and it was agreed with Revenue to perform a review focussed on specific areas which gave rise to the significant liabilities in previous years. The liability to taxes identified in the course of the self-review for 2019 was set out by means of a Self-Correction disclosure and payment (including interest) of &euro;3,174,921 was made to the Revenue Commissioners in September 2020. The amount represents 0.17% of the overall tax paid by the HSE for that year. The HSE has a dedicated in house tax team resourced by tax professionals developing a strong relationship with Revenue and with access to external advisors where necessary. The HSE remains committed to exemplary tax compliance. in 2018 this Self-Correction disclosure and payment (including interest) amounted to &euro;3,128,034. </p>  <p>  I understand that similar payments were made in previous years. My Department does not hold details of these - this information is available directly from the HSE.</p>  <p>  My Department does not hold records relating to tax settlements made by any other aegis bodies. These bodies may be contacted directly using the dedicated contact addresses available to members of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

This is the second largest staffing growth in the health service since the establishment of the HSE, with the largest growth having happened in 2020. </p>  <p>  Despite the significant growth seen, recruitment has fallen behind original targets. These targets were developed on the assumptions that there would be no vaccine rollout, and restrictions would be no higher than level 3. The unexpected Covid surge in Quarter 1 of this year and the significant recruitment through external agencies needed for the vaccine rollout has contributed to lower recruitment directly into the HSE.</p>  <p>  Given these difficulties, revised targets have been prepared by the HSE and are currently being reviewed by officials in the Department of Health. The targeted recruitment that hasn&rsquo;t materialised in 2021 will be targeted in 2022, subject to budget constraints.</p>  <p>  For the remaining elements of the Deputy's question, I have asked the HSE to respond directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This independent expert group considers the evidence for changes in a robust and transparent manner. The Committee&rsquo;s role is to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence for screening for a particular condition against internationally accepted criteria and make recommendations accordingly. This ensures policy decisions are informed by the best available evidence and advice. </p>  <p>  The NSAC is currently finalising plans for its first &lsquo;annual call&rsquo; which will be announced later this year. Proposals for new population based screening programmes and modifications to existing programmes will be welcomed from the public as well as the HSE, health professionals and other professional bodies.  </p>  <p>  Further information on the 'annual call' will be published on the NSAC website.</p>  <p>  In recent years there has been an increased investment in paediatric orthopaedics and scoliosis services, which has improved access to surgery and outpatient appointments. </p>  <p>  In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI; previously the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group) was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services.

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p><p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p><p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p><p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p><p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p><p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p><p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p><p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p><p>  At the request of my Department, the HIQA are conducting a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on a school based HPV mop-up vaccination programme (for those that were previously eligible and missed or turned down the vaccine). The HIQA has confirmed that this HTA has been added to its work programme for 2021/2022 and I have requested that my officials give consideration to the outcome of this work in the context of the immunisation programme.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists. </p><p>My Department is working with the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to develop plans to tackle the rise in waiting lists.  Firstly, with the finalisation of a short-term Waiting List Action Plan which will cover the rest of the year, until December 2021. Secondly through the development of a longer-term Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets.</p><p>The NTPF has advised that the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times. In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected. The NTPF collects data on patients currently on the waiting list and the average time that these patients have been waiting is provided here.</p><p>OP Dermatology Waiters as of 26/8/2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>Sum of Amount</th>       <th>Column Labels</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Row Labels</td>       <td>0-6 Months</td>       <td>6-12 Months</td>       <td>12+ Months</td>       <td>Grand Total</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar</td>       <td>175</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>232</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td>175</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>38</td>       <td>232</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mean NumDays</td>       <td>287</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Median NumDays</td>       <td>80.5</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated in this area. Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was introduced in March 2019 to give effect to the changes. </p>  <p>  A Judicial Review was taken by two applicant fishers challenging the validity of the Policy Directive. On 6th October 2020, the High Court judgment held that the Policy Directive was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect. The Minister appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal and a full hearing took place on 22nd June last. Judgment on the case is reserved. </p>  <p>  The Minister also sought an extension on the stay on the order of the High Court, which was granted by the Court of Appeal on 19th March last, reinstating the Policy Directive.

The NIFF is a consultative body, established to foster industry-led development of proposals for the management of fish and shellfish stocks within six nautical miles of the Irish shore. The NIFF is supported by a network of six Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums (RIFFs) that cover the Irish coast.</p><p>Since their inception, the Forums have developed initiatives seeking to protect the future of the inshore sector, which is extremely important for Irish coastal communities. The Forums involve representation from inshore fishers, environmental interests, marine leisure, marine tourism and other marine stakeholders. A dedicated website provides information on the work of the Forums: <i>www.inshoreforums.ie</i>.</p><p>In 2019, the NIFF brought forward the first industry-led Strategy for the Irish Inshore Fisheries Sector and is currently in the process of implementing the Strategy with support from BIM, my Department and other agencies. The Strategy flowed from an extensive consultation process that engaged the inshore sector itself as well as other stakeholders.</p><p>In relation to financial supports, my Department's &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme 2014-2020 is the principal source of public funding for the sustainable development of our fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing sectors. The Programme is delivered through a range of support schemes. Financial supports are available to our inshore fishing sector for capital investment on board and ashore, for training and for organisation and capacity building within the sector, while State bodies provide a range of services to the inshore fleet including advisory services and stock conservation supports. </p><p>In March 2021, I established the Seafood Sector Task Force comprised of stakeholders from our fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing sectors, together with representatives of coastal community development groups, coastal local authorities, State enterprise development agencies and others.  The remit of this Task Force is to examine the implications arising from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) between the European Union and the UK for the Irish fishing industry and coastal communities particularly dependent upon it. I have asked the Task Force to outline initiatives that could be taken to provide supports for development and restructuring so as to ensure a profitable and sustainable fishing fleet and to identify opportunities for jobs and economic activity in coastal communities dependent on fishing. </p><p>I understand that the Task Force is examining the impacts of the TCA on the inshore sector as part of its deliberations.  I anticipate a Final Report from the Task Force later this year outlining its full recommendations.</p><p>The Programme for Government - Our Shared Future, specifically sets the aim of supporting the inshore sector to establish a Producer Organisation to generate greater marketing and promotional capacity. My Department has received two such applications to date. I can confirm that one application for a Producer Organisation for the inshore sector has been approved and the other application is currently on hand.</p><p>My Department is committed to supporting the inshore community and the wider seafood sector in achieving its potential.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-05a.1970.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100500084#WRFF05800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 729 and 754 together.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in Ireland, fishing quota, including pelagic stocks such as Mackerel and Herring, is a public resource and is managed to provide for proper management and conservation and rational exploitation of the State&rsquo;s fishing quotas. It is managed as a public good that ensures that property rights are not granted to individual operators. This is seen as a critical policy in order to ensure that quotas are not concentrated into the hands of large fishing companies whose owners have the financial resources to buy up such rights. In Ireland, any movement towards privatisation and concentration of rights into the hands of large companies would seriously risk fishing vessels losing an economic link with Ireland&rsquo;s coastal communities and undermining the socio-economic importance of the fishing industry in the coastal communities dependent on fishing.</p>  <p>  The result of this long-standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet involves a balanced spread of sizes and types of fishing vessels who have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities and have delivered economic activity including vital employment in these communities, where there are very limited alternative economic activities. </p>  <p>  The arrangements have been set and developed over many years since the commencement of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the introduction of quotas. Any amendments or changes to the over arching policy on management arrangements are determined by the Minister following detailed analysis and full consultation with stakeholders, in particular the fishing industry. </p>  <p>  There are a number of opportunities for vessels to target Mackerel and Herring stocks which are open only to smaller 'inshore' fishing vessels. For example, in 2021 the following pelagic fishing opportunities have been made available to smaller 'inshore' fishing vessels:</p>  <p>  Mackerel: Mackerel policy provides that 2.50% of the 13% quota available for polyvalent vessels (194t) be made available to under 18m vessels fishing for mackerel by means other than hook and line.  Catch limits are set by monthly Fisheries Management Notice. This fishery remains open with a catch limit of one tonne for each of the months of September and October. </p>  <p>  An allocation of 400 tonnes for a fishery for smaller vessels (under 15 metre vessels) fishing for Mackerel by means of hooks and line was set down in Policy in 2010.  The then Minister amended the Mackerel policy in July 2017 after intensive review and public consultation, however this amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery.  </p>  <p>  In order to consider any review of mackerel policy, I must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect policy, it will require due process, involving an assessment of all issues arising, including a full public consultation.  </p>  <p>  There has been, for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota to the UK by 2026.  This will only increase demands for a higher share of Ireland&rsquo;s Mackerel quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet. The Deputy should be aware that the 400 tonne limit for the hook and line fishery has not been reduced and has remained the same as in previous years. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the situation is that if there is an increase in the Mackerel quota allocation for any group of vessels, such as for the hook and line fishery, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the TCA.  </p>  <p>  Celtic Sea Herring: Ireland's quota for the stock adopted by the EU Fisheries Council, in line with ICES advice, is 750t, specifically to allow for a fisheries-based data collection for this stock. As the quota is being made available to support the gathering of data for the stock, I have approved that setting aside of the 2012 Herring Policy.  Taking consideration of the Marine Institute advice and the recommendation of the Celtic Sea Herring Management Advisory Committee, I have approved the increase in the quota being made available to under 17m vessels in the Sentinel fishery from 11% to 25%.   The arrangements will provide opportunities for 24 selected inshore vessels over two management periods.   </p>  <p>  North West Herring: This autumn, the fishery will be operated as a scientific monitoring fishery.  I have approved the setting aside of 2012 Herring Policy, to support the collection of data for the stock. In the Spring of 2021, 300t was made available to facilitate data collection in January, February, March and April. 120 tonnes of this quota was made available to 8 under 12m vessels. For the Autumn period, 235t (21% of the available quota) will be made available to inshore vessels less than 12m. This will initially provide opportunities for 19 vessels. This may increase after 26 November if the uncaught quota by larger vessels is re-allocated. The re-allocation provides that 50% of this quota will be made available to authorise additional inshore vessels. </p>  <p>  Irish Sea Herring: For 2021 the available quota 915t has been allocated to 10 selected vessels.  Five of these vessels are smaller vessels under 40ft registered length.  </p>  <p>Horse Mackerel:  29t was set aside for a summer fishery under 12m in length overall fishing exclusively by means of ring nets. </p></reply>

The remit of this Task Force is to examine the implications arising from the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the UK for the Irish fishing industry and coastal communities particularly dependent upon it. I have asked the Task Force to outline initiatives that could be taken to provide supports for development and restructuring so as to ensure a profitable and sustainable fishing fleet and to identify opportunities for jobs and economic activity in coastal communities dependent on fishing. </p>  <p>  In July 2021, I received an Interim Report of this Task Force which made some limited recommendations pending its full report which I expect to receive in the Autumn.  While the Interim Report did not feature any specific recommendations relating to the inshore fishing sector, I understand that the Task Force is examining impacts of the TCA on the inshore sector as part of its deliberations.  </p>  <p>  I anticipate a Final Report from the Task Force shortly outlining its full recommendations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-10-05a.1976.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100500084#WRFF06400"><p>In 2002, Commission Regulation (EC) No 494/2002 introduced a number of technical measures to aid in the recovery of the Hake stock.  Technical measures are rules on how, where and when fishers may fish and also include gear, catch composition and ways to deal with accidental catches.  The technical measures introduced by the 2002 Regulation include minimum mesh sizes applicable in an area of the waters to the west and south of Ireland known as the "Hake Box".  These requirements are that, within the Hake Box, the minimum mesh size for towed gear is 100mm and the minimum mesh size for static gear (such as gillnets, trammel nets and entangling nets) is 120mm.  This Regulation, including the mesh size provisions, remain in force. </p>  <p>  The Technical Measures Regulation, Regulation (EU) 2019/1241 of the European Parliament and of the Council, sets out a baseline mesh size of 120mm for static nets in the North Western Waters area - which includes the waters around Ireland and fishing for hake. Regulation (EU) 2019/1241 provides for a derogation from this minimum mesh size in the case of directed fishing for hake with static nets in certain areas.  This includes the waters to the north-west, west and south of Ireland (ICES areas 5b, 6a, 6b, 7b, 7c, 7h, 7j and 7k).  The derogation within the Technical Measures Regulation permits the use of bottom set gillnets of at least 100mm for directed fishing for hake in waters with a charted depth of between 200m and 600m.  This derogation was introduced in 2006 at the request of Spain and France and includes limits on the length of gear that can be used and the length of time the gear can be left in the water, as well as the mesh size provisions. The Hake Box defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 492/2002 overlaps this area to the south and south-west of Ireland and this has created confusion over whether the 100mm  mesh size derogation is applicable within the Hake Box. </p>  <p>  Following clarification received by the European Commission, the derogation to use 100mm does not apply within the Hake Box. Therefore, in those areas within the hake box where the depth is greater than 200m, static nets of 120mm mesh size must be used. To change these provisions would require the full agreement of the North western waters member states whereby under the CFP, Member States with a fisheries interest in a given sea basin can agree on regional technical measures, adapted to the specific regional circumstances and these maybe adopted as EU secondary legislation.</p>  <p>  Ireland would not support any changes that reduce mesh sizes as indicated in the Programme for Government, where there is a clear ambition to provide the greatest protection for fish stocks and ensure a sustainable hake fishery in the longer-term.</p></reply>

The specific focus of the eligibility period from 1st November to 30th April is a relief measure aimed at reducing cattle wintering costs for restricted farmers. In order to abide by the scheme criterion of a "prolonged" breakdown an eligible Herdowner must remain restricted following a full herd Reactor Retest</p>  <p>  The rate of Hardship grant payable to eligible farmers is &euro;38 per suckler animal and &euro;25 per dairy animal capped at a maximum grant of &euro;250pm for a maximum of 4 months</p>  <p>  The TB Programme has a comprehensive compensation regime in place for herdowners who are affected by bovine TB.  These measures acknowledge the difficulty and stress of a TB breakdown and are intended to assist herdowners during restriction.  The regime is not intended to compensate a herdowner for all losses but is among the most supportive when compared to schemes in other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  In 2016, the Department concluded a lengthy consultation process on improvements to the compensation regime and the significant majority of these additional costs were borne by the taxpayer. Following this consultation, changes were made to the hardship grant to include dairy herds as eligible under the scheme.</p>  <p>  As part of the work of the TB Forum, a dedicated Financial Working group consisting of representatives from the Department and farming organisations was set up to review the current financial model of the TB programme.  The financial model underpins the funding of all schemes and grants under the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme including the hardship grant.  Discussions are ongoing in this regard and any recommendations from the Finance working group will be put forward to the TB Forum for consideration. </p></reply>

Any amendments or changes to the over arching policy on management arrangements, including pelagic stocks,  are determined by the Minister following detailed analysis and full consultation with stakeholders, in particular the fishing industry. </p><p>Management of the national mackerel quota is set down in Ministerial Policy which has been developed and put in place over a number of years.The allocation of 400 tonnes for a fishery for smaller vessels using hook and line as a means of fishing was set down in Ministerial Policy in 2010.  The Minister amended the Mackerel policy in July 2017 after intensive review and public consultation. This amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery.  </p><p>The mackerel Policy sets down that the hook and line fishery for vessels under 15m in overall length receive 400t.  </p><p>In order to amend mackerel policy, I as Minister must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect policy, it would require due process involving an assessment of all issues arising, including full public consultation.  </p><p>There has been for the past 20 years or so intensive competition within the industry for access to and a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU/U.K. Trade and Co-operation Agreement provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota by 2026 to the U.K.This will only increase demands for higher shares of Ireland&rsquo;s quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet.  It is worth noting that the 400t for the hook and line fishery has not been reduced.  Unfortunately the situation is that if there is an increase for any , such as the hook and line fishery, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the EU/ U.K. TCA.</p><p>Earlier this year, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum (NIFF) prepared a paper requesting to increase the hook and line fishery from the 400t limit to 3,000 tonnes and to increase the trip limit from 750kg to 1,500kg.  The request to increase the trip limit was subsequently withdrawn by the NIFF. As advised above, in order to amend mackerel policy, I must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review, it would require due process involving an assessment of all issues arising, including full public consultation.</p><p>The Management of the Hook and Line fishery has been on the agenda and discussed with Industry representatives including the NIFF at each of the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) meetings from March to July. My Department have kept me advised on these discussions and I am aware of the divergent industry views.  This item is next due for discussion at the QMAC October meeting. It is worth noting that the remit of the QMAC is to examine and make recommendations <i>within</i>Ministerial Policy. </p></reply>

I understand an inclusive approach was taken to identifying key issues and priorities for the sector, including a Steering Group with industry and State partners, a dedicated workshop and public consultation. Priorities identified in the Strategy include the development of a profile of the inshore sector, building the sector&rsquo;s capacity to engage with policy development and enhancing industry&rsquo;s understanding of management and planning for inshore fisheries. I understand that the Strategy also facilitates the investigation of new diversification opportunities for the inshore fisheries sector where supported by solid evidence. I am advised that the National Inshore Fisheries Forum is in the process of implementing the Strategy with support from BIM, my Department and other Agencies.</p>  <p>  Regarding spurdog, under EU Regulation, it is prohibited to target, retain on board, tranship or land picked dogfish, also known as spurdog, in North Western Waters.  The stock was subject to high harvest rates for more than four decades, and fisheries were not managed during this time. </p>  <p>  The species is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to over-fishing.  Conservation measures in recent years have reduced mortality significantly and stabilised the decline.  The biomass (a measures of the quantity of the stock) of the species has started to increase slowly, however, the biomass remains extremely low and is below the biomass limit reference point established by ICES. </p>  <p>  The latest scientific advice issued by ICES on 2nd October 2020 is that there should be no targeted fisheries for dogfish in 2021 and 2022.  The TAC and quotas for 2021 were set by the EU Council following this advice.   As this is a shared stock with the UK, setting TACs and quotas for 2022 will form part of the EU/UK bilateral negotiations, which will have regard for ICES advice for the stock for 2022.  Any EU/UK bilateral agreement will form part of the EU Commission's proposal for EU TACs and quotas for 2022 to be considered for adoption by the  EU Fisheries Council.     </p>  <p>  While there is a very limited quota available for use only in pilot schemes designed to reduce by-catches in 2021, any such schemes are subject to European Commission approval and must relate to reducing by-catches of dogfish in other fisheries, i.e. the targeting of dogfish would remain prohibited.  A scheme for dogfish avoidance was explored by the Marine Institute but, following consultation with the Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), it was decided not to proceed further with a scheme taking into account how such a scheme would operate. </p>  <p>  I requested the Marine Institute (MI) to consider proposals for cooperation between the MI and industry in conducting surveys on the abundance of spurdog around the coast.    The  Marine Institute has advised that last month it met with inshore fishing industry representatives from the National Inshore Fisherman's Association (NIFA) and the National Inshore Fishermen's Organisation (NIFO) to discuss the current scientific information and advice on spurdogs.  During the meeting the latest scientific information and industry perspectives were discussed.  I am advised that the meeting was constructive and identified a number of practical actions to improve the scientific assessment on spurdogs relating to the recording of catches and enhanced data collection.</p>  <p>  I have asked that the Marine Institute continue to work with the inshore fishing sector and through the Irish Fisheries Science Research Partners, involving industry representatives, Marine Institute and BIM, to improve the scientific evidence base which underpins sustainable fisheries management of spurdog and other stocks.</p></reply>

I understand that a number of endangered and protected species are caught as by-catch in the nets used to target crayfish. I am advised that the fishery off the south west coast in particular overlaps with an area of high diversity of elasmobranch fish and is close to grey seal haul-out sites and areas designated for harbour porpoise.</p>  <p>  The Marine Institute (MI) has been conducting research into the crayfish fishery off the south west coast since 2017. This work, funded by my Department, under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), has provided evidence of how tangle nets used in the crayfish fishery impact on other marine species caught as by-catch. </p>  <p>  The crayfish fishery is subject to a follow-on MI led project to identify management proposals aimed at eliminating by-catch of endangered species and restoring crayfish stocks. The MI published a tender in April 2021 seeking fishing vessels to participate in this project which covers a four-year period (2021-2025) and is targeted at the crayfish fishery in the area inside 12 nautical miles between Mizen Head and Loop Head.</p>  <p>  My Department recently undertook public consultation on the crayfish fishery to gather views on measures targeted at eliminating the by-catch of endangered species while seeking to secure a viable and sustainable future for the fishery. The consultation process concluded on 16 September 2021 and my Department is currently evaluating the submissions received. I can advise the Deputy that this consultation and the MI led research will assist in determining any future policy decisions on the management of this fishery.</p></reply>

Last week, during his visit to Ireland, Commissioner Sinkevicius met with industry representatives in Killybegs and heard directly from them that Ireland has paid too high a share of quota  under the TCA and I followed up with a bilateral with the Commissioner on all the issues arising.  </p><p>Later, an Taoiseach and I met the Commissioner  to further emphasise from a Government perspective that addressing burden sharing is a priority for Ireland. </p><p>EU Regulation 1380/2013 (the basic Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) regulation),  sets down that the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP by the end of 2022.  </p><p>I have made it clear, most recently during the Commissioner's recent visit,  that the Commission must undertake during 2022 a thorough review of the CFP.I am committed to doing all possible through the review to secure additional quota where possible for Irish fishers.  </p><p>The Commission published a proposal on 6 July proposing an amendment to extend the derogation for access to EU Member States 12 miles zones up until the end of December 2032.  It also removed the provisions relating to access for the UK, which are now covered in the TCA.  I consider that this important element of the CFP should be dealt with the by the Commission as part of the full CFP review and form part of the formal review and the Commission report to Council and Parliament on the functioning of the CFP.  I have written to the Commissioner to make Ireland&rsquo;s concern and our position clear.</p><p>It is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the Commission's review over the coming period, including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States. I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the review of the CFP, including the interaction with stakeholders, to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.</p><p>The Deputy will find the requested data on <i>Nephrops </i>(prawns) in the attached table.</p><p><b><i>Quotas of </i></b><b><i><i>Nephrops norvegicus</i></i></b><b><i>(Norway Lobster or Prawn) for EU Member States for 2021 as set out in Council Regulation (EU) 2021/1239 </i></b><b>(all weights in tonnes)</b></p><p><b>Waters around Ireland</b> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>ICES Area</b></th>       <th><b>Ireland</b></th>       <th><b>France</b></th>       <th><b>Spain</b></th>       <th><b>Union Total Allowable Catch</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6; UK and International waters of 5b<br /><br />(West of Scotland, North-west of Ireland)</td>       <td>202</td>       <td>121</td>       <td>30</td>       <td>353</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>7<br /><br />(West and South of Ireland)</td>       <td>6,102</td>       <td>4,023</td>       <td>993</td>       <td>11,118</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Special condition applying to Area 7 &ndash; within the limits of the quotas for Area 7, no more than the quantities across may be taken from Functional Unit 16 (Porcupine)</td>       <td>1,194</td>       <td>621</td>       <td>992</td>       <td>2,807</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>North Sea</b> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>ICES Area</b></th>       <th><b>Belgium</b></th>       <th><b>Denmark</b></th>       <th><b>Germany</b></th>       <th><b>France</b></th>       <th><b>Netherlands</b></th>       <th><b>Union Total Allowable Catch</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>UK and Union waters of 4; UK waters of 2a (North Sea)</td>       <td>997</td>       <td>997</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>29</td>       <td>514</td>       <td>2,553</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The EU proposals for the new CAP from 2023 include provision for supports for generational renewal.  With regard to direct payment supports under the next CAP, my Department proposes to operate a National Reserve under the new CAP from 2023 to prioritise access to payment entitlements for the categories of young farmers and new farmers.  My Department also proposes to operate the Complementary Income Support for Young Farmers from 2023 which will build on the success of the Young Farmers Scheme in place since 2015.  Both schemes under the new CAP will require beneficiaries to hold a recognised agricultural educational qualification.</p>  <p>   With regard to supports for young farmers under Pillar II of the new CAP, the proposed new On-Farm Investment Scheme under the Cap Strategic Plan will address key environmental objectives through the provision of grant aid for new capital investments that contribute to environmental, farm safety or animal health and welfare objectives. It is being proposed to provide a higher payment to qualified Young Farmers. Grant aid at rates between 40 to 60 % are being proposed. </p>  <p>  Government will continue to complement measures under the new CAP with national support to facilitate generational renewal through measures such as Land Mobility/Long Term Leasing Tax Relief, other agri-taxation measures and Succession Farm Partnerships.  Taken together, the combination of EU and national supports for generational renewal is significant and the complementary nature of this dual approach aligns with an EU report published in April 2021 which stated that Member States that followed a strategic, coherent and integrated approach where national measures were complementary to CAP support were more likely to achieve a positive impact.  </p>  <p>  The outline of any schemes supported under the next CAP and details of the Terms and Conditions for eligibility under such schemes will be set out once Ireland&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan is completed and approved.</p></reply>

The European Commission has exclusive competence to decide on the compatibility of State aid with the internal market. Certain categories of aid are deemed compatible, with those for the agricultural sector set out in the Agriculture Block Exemption Regulation (ABER) EU 702/2014. Article 18 of the ABER provides for start-up aid for young farmers up to a threshold of &euro;70,000 per young farmer. In line with the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) programming period 2023-2027, the ABER will shortly be subject to review.</p><p>The latest data published by Revenue shows that 1,128 &quot;Young Trained Farmers&quot; claimed stamp duty exemption relief in 2019, at a cost of &euro;14.6 million; 1,056 at a cost of &euro;16.8 million in 2018; with 845 at a cost of &euro;7.8 million in 2017. Not all of these will have reached the &euro;70,000 threshold. However, assuming that this is the cost being referred to, if all of the applicants in 2019 availed of an increased threshold (which is currently not permitted under EU State aid regulations), the cost would be as set out in table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Increased Threshold to:</th>       <th>Cost &euro;</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;80,000</td>       <td>&euro;11,280,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;90,000</td>       <td>&euro;22,560,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;100,000</td>       <td>&euro;33,840,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;110,000</td>       <td>&euro;45,120,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;120,000</td>       <td>&euro;56,400,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;130,000</td>       <td>&euro;67,680,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;140,000</td>       <td>&euro;78,960,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>With the current rate of stamp duty at 7.5%, each &euro;10,000 increase would equate to &euro;133,333 in the value of property transferred or bought.  </p></reply>

Those regulations require that to participate in the scheme, an application to participate in the scheme must be made when completing an application for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) via the single application system available on the Department's on-line facility, www.agfood.ie, by the relevant closing date.</p><p>The EU regulations set out the criteria against which appeals may be considered by the Department under the grounds of Force Majeure and Exceptional Circumstances and these criteria must be applied by my Department in accordance with the regulations.</p><p>The appeals process allows for both an appeal to officials of the Department, and the option of a further appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office should an applicant not be satisfied with the decision of the Department and this option was availed of by both of the persons named.  This office is an independent office established to provide farmers with an appeals service to farmers who are dissatisfied with decisions made by the Department concerning designated schemes operated by the Department.</p><p>My Department has continuously sought to improve and refine the application systems in place to ensure that the application process for all schemes administered by my Department are as simple as possible and that assistance is available for applicants when submitting their application.</p><p>The application process for the Basic Payment Scheme requires applicants to confirm if they wish to apply for the ANC scheme or not by selecting one of two options &ldquo;I want to apply for ANC&rdquo; or &ldquo;I do not want to apply for ANC&rdquo;.  The system will not allow an applicant for the BPS to progress past this point until they select one of these two options.</p><p>Where an applicant has selected &ldquo;I do not want to apply for ANC&rdquo; and had received payment under the scheme in the previous scheme year, they will be prompted with a message on screen  to warn them that they had received payment under the scheme in the previous scheme year but have not applied in the current scheme year.  They are advised that if they are eligible under the scheme and wish to apply they should select &ldquo;I want to apply for ANC&rdquo;.  They are also advised that if they do not want to apply, they should select &ldquo;I do not want to apply for ANC&rdquo; to continue their BPS application.</p><p>For applications under the 2021 Scheme, my Department issued a Brief Guide to the 2021 Areas of Natural Constraints scheme to eligible 2020 scheme applicants.  This guide included a section detailing how to apply for the 2021 scheme, including screen shots of the application process to aid people in submitting their application.</p><p>My Department has also made every effort to open the online application process at the earliest possible opportunity to provide applicants with as much time as possible to prepare and submit their ANC applications, or to make arrangements to seek assistance in submitting their application, such as using the services of an Agricultural Advisor to assist in the submission of their application.</p><p>For 2021, the application facility opened on the 18<sup>th</sup>of February 2021.  The deadline for receipt of applications under the 2021 scheme was the 17<sup>th</sup>of May 2021.</p><p>My Department also operates a direct payments telephone helpdesk which applicants can contact for assistance in submitting their ANC application.  Over the last number of years, the helpdesk has operated extended opening hours in advance of the closing date for submission of BPS/ANC applications.</p><p>In advance of the 2021 application deadline the helpdesk was open between 9.15am and 9.00pm from Monday 10<sup>th</sup>May to Friday 14<sup>th</sup>May, from 9.30am to 5.00pm on Saturday 15<sup>th</sup>and Sunday 16<sup>th</sup>May and between 9.15am and 12 midnight on 17<sup>th</sup>May.</p><p>Between the years 2018 and 2020, the number of eligible applications under the ANC scheme increased from 103,393 to 104,790.  The number of applicants paid under the scheme also increased from 95,802 applicants paid under the 2018 scheme to 99,588 currently paid under the 2019 scheme.  The value of payments also increased between 2018 and 2019 from &euro;229.3m in 2018 to &euro;248m in 2019.</p><p>Currently a total of 98,800 applicants have been paid a total of &euro;247m under the 2020 ANC scheme.  My Department continues to carry out weekly payment runs in relation to the 2020 scheme year in order to issue payment to additional cases that  become clear for payment.

This does not necessarily imply ownership , but simply reflects the requirement for those reductions or emissions to be counted in the State&rsquo;s inventory.  </p>  <p>  Those regulations do not create an accounting framework for private individuals or companies, nor do they create a private market for forest carbon credits or debits.</p>  <p>  There are precedents developed by private operators in some other countries,  for forest owners and organisations to  pursue voluntary initiatives in the trading of carbon and other corporate social responsibility mechanisms,  as long as they do not impact on the State&rsquo;s reporting and accounting obligations. </p>  <p>  In Ireland my Department directly funds afforestation by providing a range of grants, premiums and tax incentives on the sale of timber. It may be possible to develop a carbon farming framework in parallel with this system to encourage reductions in emissions and develop a potential alternative source of income for landowners and foresters. My Department will be exploring the potential for this in consultation with relevant stakeholders. It is also noted that carbon farming is highlighted as an option in the EU Green Deal and the European Commission is examining ways of encouraging activities that remove carbon across sectors.  </p></reply>

Where a herd meets the criteria to be regarded as a CFU under the programme, a special official supervisory and testing protocol is established. Such herds are not exempted from testing, reactor removal or disinfection requirements.</p>  <p>  Restricted CFUs are TB tested at least once a year. This CFU status arrangement allows the delivery of an effective level of disease risk management while controlling the risk of further disease spread, in compliance with animal health legislation, and enabling business continuity in this particular type of enterprise through the inward movement of cattle.  Cattle from CFU herds restricted under the TB Eradication programme are only permitted to move to an EU-approved slaughter plant. </p>  <p>  My Department does not differentiate CFU herds on the basis of ownership. </p>  <p>  The number of CFUs nationally for 2021 to date is 356.

These Regulations are an important tool in strengthening the position of primary producers, who are key to the success of our sector.</p><p>The Regulations provide for the establishment of an Enforcement Authority to deal with complaints against unfair trading practices and, as an interim measure, I established the Enforcement Authority in my Department pending the finalisation of primary legislation to establish a new Office of National Food Ombudsman or Regulator.</p><p>The Enforcement Authority has the power to investigate complaints made by agricultural and food product suppliers. The Authority may also initiate and conduct investigations on its own initiative and initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the UTPs.</p><p>The Authority currently has two full-time staff members, including a head of unit, and further staff resources will be allocated to it shortly. Work is ongoing to develop a communications and awareness-raising campaign which will commence shortly. No complaints have yet been received nor has the Authority initiated any investigations at this stage.  The Authority has not incurred any expenditure other than salary costs to-date. </p><p>I am fully committed to bringing forward legislation at an early date to establish a National Food Ombudsman or Regulator office that will bring greater levels of transparency to the sector.  </p></reply>

In the first instance, it is important that employers engage with the relevant services of the Department of Social Protection, namely Intreo and EURES. My Department, along with Teagasc and IFA, worked with that Department to organise a dedicated online jobs fair for the horticulture sector &ndash; Help2Harvest &ndash; for the past two years. The <i>#Help2Harvest2021</i>Jobs Day aimed to assist employers to recruit jobseekers for seasonal and permanent horticultural roles in Ireland. The online event, while hosted on the EURES platform, was also targeted at Irish job seekers. </p><p>The sector has also made use of the employment permit system through a pilot scheme introduced in 2018. Employment permits can only be considered when all other avenues, such as those above, have been fully exhausted. My officials are in ongoing engagement with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who have primary responsibility for economic migration policy and work permits. </p><p>Finally, I would also point to the recently published Food Vision 2030 Strategy, which contains a goal to attract and nurture diverse and inclusive talent. Among its actions are for employers in the agri-food sector to develop an education, skills and talent attraction and retention strategy, as well as a series of actions to make roles more attractive. </p></reply>

The report estimates that 65% or 252,000 tonnes of the 387,000 tonnes total utilisation is native barley.  The balance is sourced from the UK and the EU.</p>  <p>  As only basic malt is produced in Ireland, drinks requiring specialised malts are often either reliant on imported malt or the export of Irish grain for processing and the re-importation for use in the drinks industry.    </p>  <p>  My Department has funded the purchase of equipment for a Teagasc facility to test raw materials for malting and the production of small batches of specialised malts for the craft beer and distilling sector.  The equipment will also provide a facility for brewing and distilling companies to test new varieties/crops on a small commercial scale and to produce different styles of malt for different beers or spirits at a craft scale. It is expected that this facility will assist in identifying how home-grown grain can be used to meet the requirements of the drinks industry.  </p></reply>

The issues raised in the approximately 1,000 submissions received are wide ranging, complex and require analysis, further consultation with stakeholders and an exploration of approaches in other jurisdictions.  </p><p>This process is nearing completion and I expect the findings of this review to be submitted to me shortly. </p><p>Some of the issues raised may give rise to changes to existing legislation.  Therefore, in association with this consultation report, my Department is developing legislative amendments to the Control of Dogs Acts with a view to inclusion in the Government's legislative programme.  </p><p>When approved, my Department will publish the consultation report on gov.ie.</p></reply>

This is a complex issue and my Department has been advised that an indemnity scheme such as has been proposed would require legislative provision and that a number of separate pieces of legislation might need to be amended. </p><p>  In light of the complexities involved, my officials have been considering alternative pilot approaches, including an insurance solution, to address the matter on an interim basis.  Through this process, a public liability insurance policy was secured by my Department for the two existing Mountain Access Project areas, the MacGillycuddy Reeks in Kerry and Binn Sl&eacute;ibhe in Galway. This policy came in to effect from 13th August 2021.</p><p>  This pilot solution was developed in consultation with Comhairle na Tuaithe and is being implemented on a two year trial basis. There are some practical implementation issues to be finalised and these will be advanced through Comhairle na Tuaithe in the coming weeks. The policy represents a substantial step forward on this matter for landowners in the two Mountain Access Project areas involved. </p><p>  Other options around indemnity and potential amendments to the Occupiers Liability Act will continue to be explored and progressed as appropriate over the coming months. I have also committed to engaging further with the Attorney General on this matter.</p></reply>

Property owners will be part funded to improve the facades of buildings, carry out artwork and install features such as canopies and street furniture. </p><p>The initiative is being delivered by the Local Authorities on behalf of my Department. The maximum level of funding that can be provided to individual properties is set at a national level, with considerable discretion provided to Local Authorities to design the scheme locally to meet their individual needs.</p><p>As the funding is being made available from savings elsewhere in my Department's vote, it must be fully utilised before year end. The projects must be completed and funding drawndown from my Department by mid-November. My Department is working very closely with local authorities to ensure that as much flexibility as possible is being provided in the delivery of the scheme and to facilitate quick delivery on the ground. </p><p>Notwithstanding this, I am aware of concerns regarding the tight timeframes set to complete the works and the impact which weather conditions may have on delivery at this time of year. I have asked my officials to explore what further flexibility can be provided to address these concerns so as to ensure effective delivery of this worthwhile scheme. </p></reply>
