Through our participation in CSDP initiatives like Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the Coordinated Annual Review of Defence (CARD), Ireland continues to have a strong and equal voice on defence issues within the EU institutions and to meet any commitments agreed as part of our participation in such initiatives.</p>  <p>  The 2015 White Paper on Defence states that Ireland&rsquo;s participation in CSDP and the associated structures, institutions and initiatives is key, from a defence perspective, to the maintenance of Ireland&rsquo;s security and defence interest.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s participation in future European defence projects should continue to align the capability needs of the Defence Forces with what is on offer through the European Defence Agency, PESCO and any other defence initiative available to us.  </p></reply>

Irish Defence Force participation in the EUTM Mali mission is currently under review, both in relation to the strength of our deployment and the safety and security of Irish personnel. </p>  <p>  With regard to MINUSMA, Government and D&aacute;il approval was received in June 2019 for the deployment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces to participate in this mission for a two year period. Defence Forces personnel first deployed to MINUSMA in September 2019 as part of a joint deployment with German Armed Forces. The Government subsequently agreed to extend that deployment by one more year through to the end of September 2022.</p>  <p>  Irish personnel continue to be deployed with the German Armed Forces at Camp Castor in Gao and at MINUSMA HQ in Bamako, where they carry out assigned tasks in accordance with the mission mandate. The Army Ranger Wing team carry out surveillance and intelligence gathering operations as part of their remit.  Irish personnel in Gao are embedded with the larger German Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance Company and benefit from the security and force protection effort that is in place to protect the full Company.  Defence Forces participation in this mission will conclude in September 2022.  </p>  <p>  As with all overseas operations, the security situation in Mali is monitored by the Defence Forces on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

This was the seventh meeting at senior official level held with the Women of Honour Group, three of which I personally attended.</p>  <p>  The experiences shared and the views recieved from all parties informed the Terms of Reference for the Judge-led Independent Review, which was approved by Governmnent on 25th January last. </p>  <p>  The work of the Independent Review Group is well underway. I had a very fruitful meeting with the members, namely, Ms. Justice Bronagh O&rsquo;Hanlon, Ms. Jane Williams and Mr. Mark Connaughton, on 25 April last and plan to meet them again in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  I would continue to strongly encourage all stakeholders, including the Women of Honour Group and serving members, who have yet to do so, to engage with the Independent Review Group, as their contribution will be critically important in taking this work forward. The Independent Review Group is continuing to accept submissions from individuals and organisations on issues relevant to its Terms of Reference. </p>  <p>  The Government recognises the need to allow the Independent Review Group to do its work as a critical and necessary step. These assurances have been relayed to the Women of Honour Group. </p></reply>

A number of the staffing measures in the plan have been implemented and these include:</p><p>- The seagoing service commitment scheme, introduced in January 2021, aimed at retaining experienced personnel and incentivising sea-going duties.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to this Scheme. </p><p>- Revision of terms and conditions for certain specialists which resulted in the age limit for Naval Service technicians being increased from 27 to 29 years of age.  In addition flexibility in respect of the starting pay for Marine Engineering Officers was introduced and is being progressed for certain other Naval Service specialists. </p><p>I remain committed to maximising recruitment capacity and introducing measures to return to, and maintain, the establishment strength in the Naval Service and the Defence Forces as a whole. </p><p>Such measures include ensuring that, in addition to ongoing traditional recruitment, the scope of direct entry competitions is kept under consideration.  Of the 12 direct entry competitions being utilised in 2022, 8 are in respect of the Naval Service.  The campaign to re-enlist and re-commission former members of the Permanent Defence Force has also boosted specialist numbers.  </p><p>In relation to retention, there has been significant progress on pay arising from the Public Service Pay Commission recommendations along with increases from recent pay agreements.  In addition to the Naval Service commitment scheme, which followed from the reintroduction of a successful service commitment scheme for Flying Officers in the Air Corps., a tax credit for sea going Naval Service personnel is another example of targeted measures I introduced.</p><p>The PSPC report on recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces made a range of recommendations with a view to addressing recruitment and retention issues and these have been progressed through a series of projects.</p><p>Furthermore, consideration of the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces is ongoing. I intend to revert shortly to Government with a proposed response to those recommendations and a high-level action plan, which will set out proposed timelines and oversight arrangements for its implementation.</p><p>In the interim, my focus remains on restoring all branches of the Defence Forces to the current agreed strength and in that context, as outlined above, significant work has been, and continues to be, undertaken. </p></reply>

Ireland was, on this occasion, represented by Ireland's PSC Ambassador along with Department of Defence officials.</p>  <p>  There were two items on the agenda; the implementation of the Strategic Compass in respect of CSDP missions and operations and a discussion on Russian aggression against Ukraine. </p>  <p>  These discussions helped prepare the informal exchange of views over lunch with the Ukrainian Defence Minister, Oleksii Reznikov (who participated by VTC) and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. This exchange allowed Member States to receive a first-hand account of military developments in Ukraine and demonstrate continued and unwavering transatlantic solidarity with the Ukrainian people and government. Defence Ministers also received a short Current Affairs briefing which provided an update on the latest developments in Ukraine and in the Sahel, with a particular focus on Mali. Sweden and Finland also took the opportunity to formally advise of their intention to apply for NATO membership.</p>  <p>  In advance of the Foreign Affairs Council in Defence Ministers format, Ireland also participated in a meeting of the European Defence Agency Steering Board. Delegates exchanged views on the direction of EU leaders in Versailles to the Commission to prepare, in coordination with the EDA, an analysis of the EU defence investment gaps, and in particular on the EDA&rsquo;s preliminary analysis.  The steering board also approved the establishment of a Hub for EU Defence Innovation (HEDI) within the EDA.</p>  <p>  The EU response to the war in Ukraine remains a matter of the highest priority both to my EU counterparts and to me.

The treaties require that the EU respects the specific and different policies of member states in the area of security and defence and Ireland continues to have an equal voice on defence and security issues within the EU institutions.</p>  <p>  Indeed, during the course of the evolution of the CSDP, our EU partners have always fully respected Ireland&rsquo;s sovereignty, independence and neutrality. The legal guarantees given by the European Council in June 2009 confirmed that the EU&rsquo;s security and defence policy does not affect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. </p>  <p>  The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007 underpins Ireland&rsquo;s participation in certain European Defence Agency projects and sets out the requirement for Government and D&aacute;il approval.  The Programme for Governments states the need for Government and D&aacute;il approval in relation to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PESCO projects.  I don't anticipate any change in this approach. </p></reply>

Transition year students can avail of placements within the Defence Forces to undertake various programmes demonstrating career opportunities, also serving to raise awareness of the requirements of a career in the military. </p><p>Additionally, recruitment teams frequently attend recruitment and career fairs/events to promote career opportunities within each Branch of the Organisation and, to date in 2022, have attended 22 such events.The attractiveness of a career in the Defence Forces is emphasised at such events including the opportunity for continuous upskilling and availing of third level education. A recently developed infographic on the benefits of a career in the Defence Forces, also highlights this point.  </p><p>The Defence Forces have also engaged a marketing and media partner to assist with recruitment advertising to ensure engagement with the recruitment demographic across social media and other media platforms. Advertising for specialist recruitment by direct entry is placed in industry specific publications and websites. In the past few years the scope for direct entry has expanded and total of 12 direct entry competitions are being utilised in 2022. </p><p>My focus is on restoring all Branches of the Defence Forces to full strength, facilitated by ongoing staffing initiatives and the promotion of careers within the organisation.

This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles assigned by Government, as set out in the White Paper on Defence.</p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. </p>  <p>  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. A five year Equipment Development Plan for continued re-equipment was developed on a civil military basis and was published in June 2020.  The Equipment Planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging priorities, operational requirements and changes in technology. This is an ongoing iterative process. </p>  <p>  The development of a strategic airlift capability for the Air Corps although desirable and while at pre planning stage requires an informed approach and full consideration. It has not been prioritised in light of other equipment priorities and funding availability and no decisions have been made in respect of the purchase or leasing of aircraft in other roles such as specialist troop or cargo carrying capability. </p>  <p>  As with all capital investment decisions, costing over &euro;10 million, the requirements of the Public Spending Code would need to be met, covering the various steps required in assessing the viability of the proposal and those associated with relevant decision-making and potential subsequent public investment in any additional aircraft.</p>  <p>   The White Paper provides for the replacement of the CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft with larger more capable aircraft, which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was signed with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019.  The cost of the contract, including equipment fit-out and ancillary support, is approximately &euro;228.3 million including VAT. The aircraft are scheduled for delivery in 2023. </p>  <p>  The principal role of the C295 is maritime surveillance, particularly fishery protection. It also enables the Air Corps to provide a wide range of services including logistics support and transport of troops and equipment, medical evacuation and air ambulance, search and rescue and a general utility role.</p>  <p>This investment in new Maritime Patrol Aircraft for the Air Corps, which is underpinned by the White Paper on Defence, is an indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that all branches of the Defence Forces continue to retain a range of flexible conventional military capabilities in order to meet the roles assigned.  </p></reply>

LOA 1 is essentially proceeding as we are at present and seeking to move back to a full establishment figure of 9,500. The Commission has concluded that this would leave the Defence Forces unable to mount a credible defence of the State. LOA 2 would address specific priority gaps to improve on-island and overseas capabilities. LOA 3, would bring Ireland in line with other small neutral European countries in terms of spend. </p>  <p>  I am on the record as saying that we need to aim for LOA 2. This level of ambition will require an additional 2,000 personnel beyond the establishment figure of 9,500 and an increase in the defence budget of some 50%.   I have asked the Defence Forces to develop a strategic plan to examine their recruitment practices and structures to facilitate this increase in numbers and an</p>  <p>  appropriate action plan.</p>  <p>  This Commission report also includes, inter alia, consideration of issues relating to culture, recruitment and retention, working hours, work-life balance, training, promotion, diversity and a host of other matters all of which will have an impact on job satisfaction and morale.  Following relevant consultation, I will revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan, which will set out arrangements for its implementation.</p>  <p>In the interim, my focus remains on restoring all branches of the Defence Forces to the current agreed strength and in that context, there are a number of initiatives which are presently being implemented to counter ongoing staffing challenges.  There is ongoing general service and direct entry recruitment and some 110 personnel have been inducted to date in 2022. Retention measures include service commitment schemes in the Air Corps and Naval Service, and the sea-going naval personnel tax credit. Pay has improved as a result of increases arising from the Public Service Pay Commission report and from recent pay agreements. Agreement has also been reached on the extension of service limits for privates and corporals, with discussions ongoing relating to sergeants.    </p></reply>

A small number of military evaluators from NATO member states were there as observers as part of the evaluation and feedback process. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces has conducted the OCC process on three previous occasions - once in 2018 with 1 Armoured Cavalry Squadron and twice in 2021 with the Naval Service and Army Ranger Wing.</p>  <p>  Self-determination is the fundamental underpinning of OCC, in that it affords Partners the flexibility to choose not only to participate in a specific programme but also to choose their level of participation.  It is an entirely voluntary process.  </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence 2015 refers to utilising NATO as the standard and benchmark for the Defence Forces, it being the &lsquo;ISO of the military world&rsquo;.

The recent invasion of Ukraine shows the value of having such a strategic document.</p>  <p>  Following the presentation and consideration of several revisions of the text, a final draft was approved by Foreign and Defence Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on 21 March 2022 and endorsed by EU leaders at the European Council on 24-25 March. </p>  <p>  Ireland engaged with and inputted fully into the work on the Compass, as reflected in our co-signature of non-papers during the dialogue phase covering broad areas of the Compass&rsquo;s work including Partnerships, Crisis Management, and Civilian CSDP.

While discussions continue on the actions and associated proposed timelines, it should be noted that decision-making power in relation to the individual actions proposed in the Compass, remains a national competence.

The White Paper on Defence is quite clear that there is a continued requirement to retain, develop and strengthen the Reserve and that requirement will be addressed. </p>  <p>  I am very cognisant of the fact that the RDF strength level remains lower than the Establishment figure. However, I am aware of the many initiatives in place to recruit individuals to the Reserve. Supports currently provided to maximise RDF recruitment include use of social media, promotion through the DF Press Office, outreach activities by RDF members, and the use of Permanent Defence Force (PDF) exit interviews which contain information on applying to the RDF. In addition, I'm advised that the military authorities have developed a number of measures to streamline the recruitment and induction process for the RDF which, it is hoped, will yield positive results.</p>  <p>  I should mention that the ability to conduct RDF inductions during 2021 was severely impacted by the COVID-19 public health pandemic. Nevertheless, 41 new members were inducted during 2021.  A recruitment drive for the RDF was launched this year on 21 March 2022, which was advertised across a number of media channels. Recruit Liaison Officers across the RDF have been conducting local recruitment to attract applicants for this campaign. Eligible applicants are undergoing recruitment processing following which, on completion of all processing and assessments, successful applicants are inducted into the RDF for recruit training. 37 additional new members have been inducted into the Reserve so far this year, with further induction training planned.</p>  <p>  While the commitment to restoring the strength of the RDF is not in doubt, given the competing recruitment demands at present, PDF recruitment is and should remain a priority. I would add that the same personnel and resources are utilised for both PDF and RDF recruitment. Nonetheless, RDF recruitment will continue to be progressed to the greatest extent possible.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the publication earlier this year of the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces containing many detailed recommendations, including on the future structure and role of the RDF. </p>  <p>The process to consider the full set of recommendations in the Report in consultation with Ministerial colleagues and stakeholders is almost completed and I intend, before the Summer recess, to bring to Government, significant proposals encompassed in a high-level action plan.

Within that capital allocation, the defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141 million. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.</p>  <p>  The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020 was completed following extensive joint civil-military work. It provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects which will be progressed over five years. This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The Equipment Planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology and this is an ongoing process.</p>  <p>  The Naval Service Vessel Renewal and Replacement Programme is ongoing and the programme includes radar and other equipment upgrades along with the replacement of Naval Service Reserve motor launches. The programme of works for the midlife refit and upgrade of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n has been completed, while works are ongoing on L&Eacute; Niamh. Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of multi-role vessel to replace the flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, with work underway that will inform a public tender competition in due course. Two Inshore Patrol Vessels have been purchased from the New Zealand Government to replace L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Ciara, it is expected these vessels will be transported to Ireland in 2023 following the completion of a programme of works. The planned replacement of three vessels maintains a 9 ship fleet for the Naval Service.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020. The work of the Commission encompassed the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces. </p></reply>

This informs the calculation of remuneration for individual members. The military authorities have undertaken a feasibility study with a view to implementing a time and attendance system which will capture the hours work for serving members, which will provide further clarity in this regard. The proposed system is currently under review but I&rsquo;m further advised that my officials are continuing to engage with the military authorities on the possibility of applying interim enhanced time recording measures.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, unlike other areas of the Public Service and due to the nature of the duties performed, overtime payments are not available to members of the Defence Forces and comparisons with other areas of the Public Service must be cognisant of the unique role, structure, duties and working conditions of service which are particular to military personnel. </p>  <p>  In that regard a Military Service Allowance, which is designed to compensate for the special disadvantages associated with military life including long and unsocial hours, is paid to all ranks up to the level of Colonel. It is of course also the case that in addition to basic pay and military service allowance, certain positions in the Defence Forces also attract specialist and technical pay and that a range of duties also attract additional allowances. These duty based allowances are not analogous to overtime as such payments are in addition to basic pay and MSA and are related to the duties undertaken.</p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight that in instances where members of the Defence Forces acquire technical qualifications and/or fill associated appointments, there is associated technical pay. Defence Force personnel also receive tax free payments for certain overseas deployments and duties. Furthermore, Defence Force personnel receive three additional public holidays over and above the public sector norms. These additional holidays are specific only to members of the Permanent Defence Force.  </p>  <p>  As you are also aware, the Commission's Report included an examination of the evolution of all remuneration systems and structures currently in place in the Defence Forces, and made a number of recommendations in this area. Given the significant recommendations contained in this Report, I have been engaging with all interested stakeholders on the content, including my Ministerial colleagues, members of the Defence Forces, and the Representative Associations. I will revert to Government very shortly with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in this regard.</p></reply>

To that end, the Defence Forces is committed to supporting a diverse workforce through its various policies and strategies. These include the "Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement and Action Plan" launched in 2016. In addition, in 2016, the Defence Forces LGBTA Network "Defend with Pride" was established to provide support and guidance to LBGT personnel and allies. </p>  <p>  On 30 November 2021, the Chief of Staff convened the Organisational Culture Standing Committee (OCSC), to provide an enduring structure to drive and co-ordinate the process of cultural change into the future. The OCSC aims to raise the consciousness of the personnel currently serving in the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.  </p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to ensuring that every member of the Defence Forces has the right to undertake their duties in a safe environment underpinned by dignity and equality. It is clear that the systems, policies and pervading culture in the Defence Forces, have not, and are not serving all Defence Forces personnel well.   </p>  <p>  Accordingly, as the Deputy will be aware, I established the Judge-led Independent Review Group (IRG), on 25 January last, following Government approval, to examine issues relating to bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual misconduct, as well as workplace culture, in the Defence Forces. I can confirm to the Deputy that the work of the Review Group is well underway.   </p>  <p>  I, along with the Secretary General and Chief of Staff, are fully committed to ensuring that every member of the Defence Forces has the right to undertake their duties in a safe environment underpinned by dignity and equality. </p></reply>

Quite simply, the members expect, and deserve, nothing less. </p>  <p>  To-date, I have received four monthly reports from the Chair of the Review Group outlining the progress of the Review. I look forward to further monthly reports, in line with the Terms of Reference, including any interim assessments or recommendations on addressing any issues arising which may require immediate action. In addition, it is expected that the six-month interim assessment will be submitted to me at the end of  July.  </p>  <p>  In line with the Terms of Reference, the monthly reports and interim assessment will not be published. The final report which is to be presented to me at the end of the year, will be brought to Government, and will thereafter be published.  </p>  <p>  As previously advised, I had a very fruitful meeting with the Group namely, Ms. Justice Bronagh O&rsquo;Hanlon, Ms. Jane Williams and Mr. Mark Connaughton, on 25 April last and plan to meet the Group again in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that I received a Report from Raiseaconcern, on the work undertaken by the Confidential Contact Person (CCP), which was established last October as part of interim supports in assisting members of the Defence Forces affected by issues relating to bullying, harassment, discrimination or sexual misconduct in the workplace.   As agreed, this Report, which is entirely anonymised, has been passed to the Review Group and will be an important input into their ongoing deliberations.  </p>  <p>  I wish to add that the Independent Review will include the receipt of the views and experiences from both current and former Defence Forces personnel of workplace incidents of alleged unacceptable behaviour. The sharing of such views and experiences by interviewees will be entirely voluntary and treated in confidence.  </p>  <p>  The Independent Review Group is also continuing to accept submissions from individuals and organisations on issues relevant to its Terms of Reference. These submissions will also form an important input to the Group&rsquo;s final review report. Details of how to make a submission are available on its website.  </p></reply>

There is no provision in EU treaties for the creation of an EU army and no proposal has been set out to change this. Therefore, any such proposal would require treaty change and no such change has been proposed.</p>  <p>  Moreover, during the course of the evolution of the EU&rsquo;s CSDP, our EU partners have always fully respected Ireland&rsquo;s sovereignty, independence and neutrality. The legal guarantees given by the European Council in June 2009 confirmed that the EU&rsquo;s security and defence policy does not affect or prejudice Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality. </p>  <p>  The recently approved Strategic Compass sets out an analysis of the strategic environment and, in particular, the security and defence challenges faced by the EU, including emerging threats, the increasingly contested multi-polar world and the strategic implications for the EU.</p>  <p>Recently, an overview and proposed timelines of the implementation of the Strategic Compass was shared with Member States. While discussions continue on the actions and associated proposed timelines, it should be noted that the decision-making power in relation to the individual actions proposed in the Compass, remains a national competence. Nothing in the Compass prejudices the specific character of the security and defence policy of any Member State and this must remain the case through the implementation phase.   </p></reply>

However, as the Deputy will be aware, the Defence (Amendment) Act 2021 has now been signed into law, which serves to update the Defence Legislation on the use of the RDF on a voluntary basis, on-island and overseas in support of the PDF and where it is in the best interests of the PDF.</p>  <p>  I have written to the Chief of Staff seeking his advice on these matters as they pertain to the requirements of the PDF.</p>  <p>  In tandem, the practical arrangements to implement the amendment, including all the elements associated with the voluntary service by RDF members overseas,  are under active consideration by my officials and the military authorities. Furthermore, my officials will also be actively consulting with RDFRA, the Representative Association for the RDF on these matters at the appropriate juncture. </p>  <p>  The outcome of these deliberations, and the advice of the Chief of Staff,  will inform my consideration of these matters. The Deputy will appreciate therefore that I do not wish to comment further pending the outcome of this process. </p>  <p>  Separately, and on foot of the enactment of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2021, I engaged with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE) on the issue of employment protection for RDF members who might be engaged in such voluntary military service in support of the PDF going forward.</p>  <p>  Engagement at official level with DETE has continued since then to consider the matter and identify appropriate next steps. This body of work is ongoing.</p>  <p>Finally, as the Deputy will also be aware, the Report of the Independent Commission on the Defence Forces, published in February of this year, includes proposals on the role and contribution of the RDF. There has been a process underway to consider the full set of  recommendations in consultation with Ministerial colleagues and stakeholders. I intend to revert to Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess.   </p></reply>

The Government, however, has committed to amending this Act and bringing both the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the scope of its provisions, where appropriate.  </p>  <p>  The Working Time Directive, recognises the specific nature of certain military activities and allows for derogations or exemptions of such activities. Extensive work undertaken by civil and military management has determined that a high percentage of the normal everyday work of the Defence Forces is already in compliance with the Working Time Directive.  However, it has also been determined that there are some activities which may qualify for an exemption due to their very specific nature. </p>  <p>  I understand that ongoing deliberations by civilian and military management on the wider implementation of Working Time Directive within the Defence Forces are at an advanced stage and nearing conclusion.</p>  <p>  The deliberations between civilian and military management, are being informed by the interpretation of recent European Case Law on military service, the fundamental requirement to ensure that rights are afforded to serving members, and the requirement to ensure that the Defence Forces can continue to fulfill their essential state functions. As the Deputy will appreciate, these are complex matters. </p>  <p>  I am assured that the outcome of those deliberations, including with regard to possible exemptions for certain activities, will be fully aligned with the provisions of the EU Working Time Directive and case law on these matters. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a sub-committee of the Defence Conciliation and Arbitration Council (comprising of the Representative Associations, military and civil management) was established to discuss matters relating to implementation of the Working Time Directive, where appropriate. Arising from those discussions, a number of amended practices regarding compensatory rest have been introduced. </p>  <p>  This builds upon existing work practices relating to compensatory rest which comply with the Directive. Consultation on the outcome of the deliberations by civilian and military management on the wider implementation of Working Time Directive will be undertaken through the mechanism of the Conciliation and Arbitration Sub-Committee in the very near future. </p>  <p>  My Department will thereafter engage with the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, who are the lead Department responsible for drafting any necessary amendments to primary legislation.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the health and safety of personnel in the Defence Forces remains a priority for myself and the Chief of Staff and we remain fully committed to ensuring that the provisions of the Working Time Directive are applied throughout the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

The tradition, following the establishment of the Naval Service, was to name vessels after Irish female mythological figures. In 2013, the then Minister instructed that a review of the naming policy should be undertaken and following that review the Minister came to the view that the naming of the ships after world renowned Irish literary figures reflected a more modern and inclusive Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Naval Service Vessel Renewal and Replacement Programme is ongoing. It is expected that the two Inshore Patrol Vessels, recently purchased from the New Zealand Government to replace L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Ciara, will be transported to Ireland in 2023 following the completion of a programme of works. While a project is underway to replace the flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, with a multi-role vessel, it is expected to take a number of years before that vessel is delivered in to service. Decisions relating to the naming of vessels that join the Naval Service fleet at dates in the future have yet to be taken.</p></reply>

The EU and Morocco also signed an Agreement on additional liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, processed agricultural products, and fish and fisheries products, which entered into force in October 2012.</p>  <p>  Both parties agreed upon a protocol establishing a Dispute Settlement Mechanism, which entered into force in 2012. Negotiations for a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) started in 2013. The last negotiating round was held in April 2014. </p>  <p>  The EU-Morocco Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA), concluded in March 2019, allocates fishing opportunities for the EU in exchange for an overall financial contribution of &euro;208 million. A substantial part of this contribution is used to promote the sustainable development of the fisheries economy in Morocco and the Western Sahara. </p>  <p>  Under the FPA, Ireland is entitled to receive quotas as follows over the four-year period &ndash; Year 1 &ndash; 3,099 tonnes, Year 2 &ndash; 3,281 tonnes, Years 3 &amp;amp; 4 &ndash; 3,646 tonnes in the FPA&rsquo;s industrial pelagic category. However, no Irish fishing vessels are currently operating in Morocco and no Irish fishing vessels have operated in Morocco  since 2007. The allocation has, in the past, been swapped with other member states. </p>  <p>  When the process of negotiation began on the current FPA agreement, Ireland sought that any agreement should be more transparent and should include clear and specific reporting on the benefits of the Agreement in the Western Sahara. Ireland supported the adoption of the FPA, issuing the following statement on its adoption:</p>  <p>  'Ireland stress the importance of a strong political and economic partnership between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco.</p>  <p>  Ireland underlines the importance of complying with EU law, of which international law may be considered an integral part when entering into bilateral agreements. We have taken careful note of the &ldquo;&ldquo;Contribution of the Council Legal Service on the Draft amended Fisheries Agreement and draft new Fisheries Protocol with Morocco- compatibility with the case-law of the Court&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently emphasized that an agreement has to be consistent with the judgment of the Court of Justice handed down on 27 February 2018 in Case C-266/16. We take the content and form of the Contribution as evidence that the Council Legal Service considers that entering into the presented agreement is fully consistent with the judgment of the Court of Justice handed down on 27 February 2018 in Case C-266/16 and does not prejudice the status of Western Sahara. Ireland continues to support the United Nations process to find a just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution for Western Sahara.</p>  <p>  On the basis of the above, Ireland supports the adoption of the Council decision on the amendment of the Fisheries Agreement and the Fisheries Protocol'.</p>  <p>  The question of the territorial applicability of certain EU-Morocco agreements is the subject of ongoing legal consideration at the European level. Ireland notes the October 2021 European Court of Justice ruling that annulled the EU&rsquo;s previous approval of agriculture and fishing agreements that allowed Morocco to exports goods from Western Sahara. That decision is currently being appealed. Ireland will await the outcome of this process and, together with our EU partners, give careful consideration to the decision reached. </p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland&rsquo;s long-held position is that Western Sahara is a non-self-governing territory. We support the United Nations Security Council Resolutions, which support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.</p>  <p>  Finally, in 2021, under the new EU Trade Policy Review, the EU has offered to discuss modernising trade and investment relations with Morocco, to better adapt them to today&rsquo;s challenges, notably in respect of value chains and the greening and digitalisation of respective economies.</p></reply>

These lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit and are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review in order to maintain the relevance of the lists of occupations to the needs of the economy.</p>  <p>  These reviews are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Solas Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) and include a public consultation process and extensive consultation with other Government Departments through the Interdepartmental Group on Economic Migration Policy.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, impact on the labour market.</p>  <p>  When considering if an occupation specified is eligible for a Critical Skills Employment Permit, a General Employment Permit or if it is ineligible for an employment permit, consideration is given to both the job title and the description of the proposed employment provided in the application.</p>  <p>  Occupations included on the Ineligible List are occupations where there is evidence that there are more than enough Irish/EEA workers available to fill such vacancies, and therefore an employment permit shall not be granted in Ireland.  Every other job in the labour market, where an employer cannot find a worker, may be eligible for an employment permit.</p>  <p>  The employment permits legislation sets out various criteria that must be met when considering an application for each of the permit types available, including establishing that there is evidence of a lack of suitable labour within the domestic labour market, that a contract of employment exists between the employer and the employee, and the minimum annual remuneration and duration of the proposed employment.</p>  <p>  Each employment permit application is assessed on its own merits and is required to meet the legislative requirements for the permit type. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the legislation, an application for a permit where the job title is in an ineligible category cannot be approved.</p></reply>

I look forward to hearing the views of all those with an interest in the proposal and I intend to have further engagement with stakeholders over the coming months. I also intend to launch a public consultation to help inform our position on the proposal. However, the nature and timing of this consultation will depend on further progress being made in clarifying issues at EU level. </p></reply>

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG which outlines the arrangements for the implementation of the CEG, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. More information is available here: www.cru.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CRU21131-Interim-Clean-Export-Guarantee-Decision-Paper.pdf </p><p>Micro-Generators who wish to become eligible should register for an export grid connection from ESB Networks (Micro-Generators (esbnetworks.ie)) and have a smart meter installed, where applicable (Smart Meter Upgrade FAQs (esbnetworks.ie)). </p><p>Over 30,000 micro- and small-scale generators have successfully registered for export and 22,500 of this cohort have smart meters which means they are already accruing the value of the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff for their exported electricity, and payments will be backdated to the date of eligibility or the 15th February 2022, whichever is the latest. </p><p>The CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. Once eligible, customers can expect an initial payment or credit from their suppliers from 1st July depending on billing cycle. The CRU has asked suppliers to communicate their decision to their customers on when initial Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) payments will be made at the earliest opportunity. </p><p>The CRU encourages customers to contact their supplier to obtain information on their suppliers' CEG tariff arrangements.</p></reply>

Applications are assessed against a number of criteria from a technical and financial perspective in accordance with Section 9A (1) of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 and Section 3 of the 2007 Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, Development and Production. It is important to note that this assessment process is informed only by financial, technical and environmental considerations and not by energy security or broader energy policy matters.   In March 2022, the European Council directed the European Commission to develop a plan that will phase out EU dependence on Russian fossil fuel imports. RePowerEU plan was subsequently published by the Commission on 18 May 2022 in response to this. Careful consideration by Member States of the measures proposed by the Commission is now required, and in particular regarding the proposal to reopen several legislative files within the Fit for 55 Package.</p>  <p>  As stated in the plan, &ldquo;REPowerEU is about rapidly reducing our dependence on Russian fossil fuels by fast forwarding the clean transition and joining forces to achieve a more resilient energy system and a true Energy Union.&rdquo; This is broadly in line with Ireland&rsquo;s ambitions in renewable energy with a target of 5GW of offshore wind to be installed by 2030. The plan also calls for more investment in cross border energy infrastructure including electricity interconnection as this will help realise a more resilient energy union. Ireland currently has two interconnector projects in development, and we are in the process of strengthening the policy framework for interconnection with the National Policy Statement on electricity interconnection scheduled to be updated by the end of 2022.</p></reply>

The targets to be set out in respect of a sector must include appropriate targets in respect of reductions in material resource consumption and the use of non-recyclable material; increases in the use of reusable products and materials; increased levels of repair and re-use; or improved maintenance and optimised use of goods, products and materials. The strategy must also set out the actions necessary to meet those targets. I have also agreed to publish a report on how the use of single use packaging used in the sale of fruit and vegetables can be reduced.   </p>  <p>  A number of measures aimed at significantly reducing the amount of plastic packaging placed on the Irish market are already in place. The Single Use Plastics Regulations 2021 includes outright bans on specific single-use items, labelling requirements for certain products and the introduction of a number of new Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes. </p>  <p>  Also, the Waste Directive Regulations 2020 introduced a new requirement for collective EPR schemes to &ldquo;eco&rdquo; modulate the financial contributions paid by producers. The provision incentivises producers to design products that contribute to waste prevention and facilitate recycling by taking into account their durability, reparability, re-usability and their recyclability. Essentially, recyclable packaging incurs lower fees than non-recyclable packaging; penalising non-recyclable composites and over-packaging. Since July 2021, Repak, Ireland&rsquo;s packaging EPR scheme, is implementing this approach for plastics and will extend to all packaging from next year.    </p></reply>

Embracing and implementing a Blended Working policy is part of my Department's key strategic actions and represents an opportunity to transform how the Department works and delivers results for the citizen. It is envisaged that Blended Working will facilitate and drive the Department and staff to deliver on the Department's vision as set out in our Statement of Strategy <b><i>Le Ch&eacute;ile 23</i></b>for a climate neutral, sustainable and digitally connected Ireland.</p><p>There were 490 staff employed by my Department on 31 May 2022, with a 478.08 full time equivalent.</p><p>From 16 March 2020 staff were encouraged to work remotely to the greatest degree possible in line with public health restrictions. As public health guidance evolved, working arrangements changed with some staff working from the offices at times when urgent business needs required and public health guidance allowed. Ensuring the health and wellbeing of our staff while maintaining public services in the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic was paramount.</p><p>Following engagement with staff, my Department began new working arrangements to facilitate a transition to Blended Working on 21 March 2022. Staff are encouraged to work remotely at home for 2 days each week and 2 days from the Department&rsquo;s offices. The fifth day is discretionary, and staff may either work from home or from the office based on the business needs of the Department. The working arrangements apply to all staff regardless of assigned office location, however, in line with business needs, there are a small number of roles where blended working is not feasible and staff work fully on site. In general, fully remote working is not available unless under medical or reasonable accommodation needs, in line with medical guidance. To ensure the health and safety of all staff when working from home and in the office, ergonomics training and assessments have been made available and the working arrangements are supported by comprehensive training, guidance and communications. These working arrangements will remain in place until September when the Department's Blended working policy will be rolled out, in line with the Civil Service Framework for Blended Working, published 31 March 2022.</p></reply>

As part of the achievement of this reduction, the CAP set ambitious targets to retrofit the equivalent of 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2/cost optimal or carbon equivalent and the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes to replace older, less efficient heating systems by end-2030.  This represents approximately 30% of the housing stock and is among the most ambitious retrofit programmes worldwide.  As part of the implementation of the Climate Action Plan and National Retrofit Plan, the Government recently announced a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills and lower emissions. This includes home that are reliant on solid fuel for heating. Included in these measures was the establishment of the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offering significantly increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with heat pump.</p>  <p>  The Government is clear that it is important that households that want to take a step-by-step approach to upgrading their homes should also be supported. In this regard, the Better Energy Homes Scheme supports homeowners to take a step-by-step approach or self-manage their project with increased grant amounts of between &euro;3,500 and &euro;6,500 for a heat pump.</p>  <p>  The grants which have been made available aim to maximise emissions reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants focus on first increasing energy efficiency and then switching to electric heating with a heat pump. Following significant preparatory analysis the grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer.</p></reply>

The National Energy Security Framework, published in April 2022, provides a single overarching and initial response to address Ireland&rsquo;s energy security needs in the context of the war in Ukraine. It coordinates work connected to energy security across the electricity, gas and oil sectors and sets out a &lsquo;Whole-of Government&rsquo; response to the challenges posed to energy security and energy affordability. </p><p>As set out in this Framework, the review of the energy security of Ireland&rsquo;s gas and electricity systems is scheduled for delivery in quarter 3 of this year, following which the results will be submitted to Government.  This review is focussed on the on the period to 2030 and will examine the risks to security of supply and a range of potential mitigating option including LNG.  The underlying technical analysis is currently being updated to take into account the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The Policy Statement on importing fracked gas was approved by Government and published in May 2021. The policy statement provides that, pending the outcome of this review, it would not be appropriate for the development of any LNG terminals in Ireland to be permitted or proceeded with.  </p></reply>

I have therefore referred the question to the Authority for direct reply.</p>  <p>  I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.</p>  <p>  With regard to extending the validity of existing test certificates, EU Member States are required to carry out periodic roadworthiness inspections on motor vehicles at specified regular intervals. </p>  <p>  Under Regulation 3(2) of the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 415/2017), which sets out the applicable dates for periodic testing, the initial test due date for a vehicle is determined using the date of registration of that vehicle and subsequent test due dates fall on anniversaries of that date. Accordingly, all test due dates are predetermined based on the date of registration of a vehicle and any NCT certificate issued in respect of a vehicle is only valid up to the test due date that falls after that certificate was issued.</p>  <p>  Ireland, like all EU Member States, is obliged to adhere to the specified minimum intervals between roadworthiness inspections. Permitting the validity of roadworthiness certificates to be extended without inspection would place the State in breach of our obligations under European law and may negatively impact road safety should the vehicle in question be unsafe to drive. There are no current plans to amend this legislation.</p>  <p>  However, I am very aware of the serious challenges that the RSA and the NCTS are currently facing to meet demand and the delays which vehicle owners have encountered since the start of this year. This is a serious matter. My department will continue to monitor the RSA's progress to reduce test delays as part of its ongoing corporate governance processes.</p></reply>

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. </p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  Providing free public transport is often seen as a silver bullet solution to our transport and climate challenges. And while I recognise the importance of incentivising greater use of our public transport services, I am not convinced that providing free public transport is the most balanced means of achieving this objective. </p>  <p>  COVID gave us some insight into the level of funding that might be required in the absence of fare revenue. For example, in 2020, an additional &euro;370 million was required to enable the continued operation of public transport services due to the collapse of fare intake. In 2021, &euro;659m was required to run PSO services, and this year we have allocated &euro;538 million for the continuation of these essential services. Apportioning such significant levels of Exchequer resources to one goal undoubtedly impacts the State&rsquo;s ability to support other worthy public services. </p>  <p>  While I might not agree that free transport provides the answer, I do believe there is merit in incentivising fares when an appropriate balance can be struck. In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, I was delighted to introduce the Young Adult Card in May which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an average of discount of 50% on public transport fares. In addition, a 20% average PSO fare reduction was introduced as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living.</p>  <p>  In addition, as well as the TFI 90 Minute Fares scheme which means that adults now pay &euro;2, young adults pay &euro;1, and children pay just 65 cent to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin. In May alone, the number of people who had a Child Leap Card, Student Leap Card, or the new Young Adult Leap Card increased by over 16,000, which is very encouraging.</p>  <p>  While fare reductions are to be welcomed, investment in additional services is also critical. For this reason, I am committed to progressing core projects like BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and DART+ as well as improving existing services across the country.</p>  <p>  Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas around the country which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.  In recognition of the important role these operators play, the Government has continued to provide temporary financial supports throughout the Covid-19 pandemic for certain licensed commercial services, with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.</p>  <p>In acknowledgment of the continuing difficulties facing this sector, these supports for the commercial sector were recently extended up to the 30th   of June 2022. To date over &euro;60m has been provided to support the Commercial Bus Operators during this challenging time.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the YAC will be broadened to include commercial operators at a later date. However, it is important to note that it is technically more challenging to roll-out fare initiatives such as the Young Adult Card on the commercial bus network than it is on the LEAP enabled PSO network. As such, it will take longer to make this fare discount available to Commercial Bus Operators.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is in detailed discussions with transport operators and the Department of Transport regarding the range of issues that need to be addressed.  To assist with this process, the NTA has established a joint working group with commercial bus operators to consider options and develop a plan to implement the Young Adult Card on Commercial Bus Operators in as timely a manner as possible, taking account of current ticketing capabilities to ensure a viable scheme is implemented</p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, in light of the Authority's responsibility in this area I have forwarded the Deputies specific questions in relation to free transport, to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

Furthermore, no special regulations have been developed to govern the carriage of passengers by passenger cars which are not SPSVs.  Therefore, the classic model where anyone with a car and the relevant App, can provide taxi services, does not exist here.</p>  <p>  I have not met with the companies concerned.  I have met with the Advisory Committee on SPSVs three times during the pandemic, with the last meeting taking place on 25 November 2021. These meetings provided me with a valuable opportunity to get first-hand information on the issues affecting the industry, including on the impact that the Covid-related restrictions at the time were having on operators.  The Committee is the primary forum for discussing issues in relation to the SPSV sector. It was established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 to provide both the Minister and the NTA with advice in relation to small public service vehicles and their drivers. Neither the NTA nor the Minister are bound by any advice provided. </p>  <p>  There has been a representative from a dispatch operator, namely Free Now, on the Committee since 2019, acknowledging the fact that Free Now is currently the largest taxi dispatch operator in Ireland, with around two-thirds of all taxi drivers affiliated to it. Therefore, the views of taxi dispatch operators are listened to and are of great significance to the Committee.</p>  <p>  Drivers are an important part of the Committee&rsquo;s membership, and four positions on the Committee are reserved for members who can represent driver interests. All four of these positions are filled by licenced SPSV drivers from across the country and I am satisfied that this ensures the Committee&rsquo;s advice is informed by the perspective of drivers. The Committee also features representatives of disabled passengers and older passengers, and members from the tourist industry, local government and from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. One of the Committees' strengths is this broad and diverse representation. The perspective of passengers is of particular importance in considering SPSV policy issues.</p></reply>

These Safety Recommendations have been deemed either closed or in process of implementation. This reflects the significant work done by the Department and the Irish Coast Guard since the tragic loss of R116 in 2017. Where a Recommendation is in process of implementation the Department clearly set out next steps and timeframes for completion and the AAIU has acknowledged the proposed steps.</p>  <p>  In the week following the publication of the AAIU report into the accident I and my colleague Minister Eamon Ryan spoke extensively in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad respectively (17th and 18th November) outlining the progress which had been made which I can refer to here. </p>  <p>  The Department did not wait for the publication of the final report to implement changes on foot of the lessons learned following the accident. Since March 2017, and specifically following receipt of the draft final report in September 2019, the Department and, in particular, the Irish Coast Guard, have undertaken a significant programme of change across key areas to take account of issues raised and recommendations addressed to me.</p>  <p>  On foot of the interim report of the air accident investigation unit, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport commissioned an independent review of oversight arrangements for search and rescue aviation operations in Ireland. Following publication of the independent review, known as the AQE report, in September 2018, the then Minister committed to implementing its 12 recommendations. The measures that have been taken fall under six broad categories: the development of a new national search and rescue framework, the national SAR plan or NSP; enhancing safety and oversight across the search and rescue system; addressing oversight of search and rescue aviation elements nationally and internationally; the review and revision of all relevant standard operating procedures and training for Coast Guard personnel, in particular rescue co-ordination centre staff training, with a focus on aviation tasking including the introduction of a formal course on tasking of aviation assets delivered by an IAA authorised training organisation; the development of an externally accredited safety management system in the Coast Guard; and a review of governance arrangements in regard to the aviation contractor, enhancing aviation expertise in critical areas and legislative reform of the IAA.</p>  <p>  A new search and rescue framework, the NSP, which provides for more explicit governance, assurance and oversight roles across the SAR system, was noted by Government and published in July 2019. The key objectives of the NSP are to achieve a rebalancing of the previous maritime-centric SAR framework to encompass air and land SAR more comprehensively; establish effective governance, oversight and assurance across the SAR system to take account of national and international obligations; achieve clarity on roles, inter-relationships and responsibilities from the strategic through to tactical and operational levels; develop a common approach to managing SAR incidents across the three domains; to set priorities, objectives and performance expectations, measure performance at system level; and provide a sound and clear basis for continuous improvement.</p>  <p>  The NSP sets out more explicit governance, assurance and oversight roles across the SAR system. The plan resets a more strategic and focused national search and rescue committee with a leaner and more coherent set of sub-committees, including an SAR consultative committee, a regulators forum, a health and safety forum and an aviation forum. The plan also sets out a clear description of the national SAR system, including roles, inter-relationships and responsibilities from the strategic through to tactical and operational levels.</p>  <p>  Another deliverable was an implementation plan for the recommended model for a joint rescue co-ordination centre, JRCC. It is a special type of rescue co-ordination centre that is operated by personnel from the maritime rescue co-ordination centre and the aviation rescue co-ordination centre. This virtual JRCC is intended to capitalise on the strengths of the current model, minimising disruption and exploiting opportunities for enhanced technology, closer co-operation and revised operating procedures, notably to address the vulnerabilities identified in the existing model and to provide for stronger oversight arrangements.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on the implementation of the new joint model. The Coast Guard and IAA have agreed a concept of operations and procedures manual and this work has resulted in increased collaboration and professional interaction between the Coast Guard and the aeronautical rescue co-ordination centre. Formal establishment is subject to the filling of newly established positions in the Coast Guard rescue co-ordination centre following a public appointments service process.</p>  <p>  As an appendix to the NSP, guidance is provided on the development of a common approach to managing SAR incidents across all three domains of land, maritime and aeronautical SAR, including the transition from search and rescue to search and recovery. It was agreed that the NSP would be delivered on a phased basis to enable a managed and integrated approach to the development of the new SAR structures, along with the coherent development of memoranda of understanding and service level agreements between all relevant stakeholders to underpin the new assurance mechanism.</p>  <p>  Since then, progress in delivering key aspects of the implementation plan has been good, with the majority of actions completed and the remainder on track for delivery in 2022. The actions include the first annual report of the NSARC on the NSP, which was approved in July of last year and subsequently published by the Government on gov.ie. The second annual report will be presented shortly.</p>  <p>  Key performance indicators for the NSP are being developed by a dedicated working group. The development of a new dynamic SAR assets register is under way. A new aviation training programme for Irish Coast Guard staff provided by an IAA approved training provider is ongoing. In addition to the Irish Coast Guard staff, course participants include aeronautical rescue co-ordination centre staff and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the Garda air support unit, which is indicative of the increased collaboration between the three SAR co-ordinators.</p>  <p>  As mentioned earlier, in light of safety recommendations, the Coast Guard is building on its safety management system, which encompasses all aspects of its operations. The safety management system will be externally accredited to ISO 45001. A review and revision of all relevant standard operating procedures and training of Coast Guard personnel was completed and updated on foot of incident reviews under the Coast Guard continuous improvement regime.</p>  <p>  In regard to implementing a safety management system to ISO 45001 the Coast Guard is in the final stages of work to prepare for accreditation later this year. The Coast Guard is also implementing a range of measures which represent a SAR assurance system. This includes updating and renewing its memorandums of understanding, MOUs, with SAR co-ordinators and SAR facility providers. MOUs are based on an agreed template setting out respective roles and responsibilities, services provided, availability and oversight arrangements. This includes continuous system improvement, risk assessment and safety management. The vast majority of these MOUs are completed with first-line SAR facility providers and SAR co-ordinators. Work is ongoing with the remaining support organisations with which the Coast Guard has links.</p>  <p>  The legislative framework for the regulation of coast guard aviation activities continues to be enhanced. The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), in consultation with the IRCG and the Department, developed a revised set of regulations and detailed rules specific to search and rescue. These were published on 1 June. Further national legislation for coast guard aviation operations is set out in the Irish Aviation Authority (Regulation of Irish Coast Guard Aviation Operations) Order 2022 (S.I. 212 of 2022) which came into force on 1 May. The IAA is developing procedures to transition from the existing SAR Approval to a National Coast Guard Approval provided for in S.I. 212 of 2022, which will provide for a single regulatory framework to cover all coast guard aviation activities. The IAA, the IRCG and the Department, will continue to work closely together to enhance the regulation and oversight of coast guard aviation operations. </p>  <p>  I hope this account satisfies the Deputy, further information and general information on the Search and Rescue services work in Ireland will be available in the National SAR Plan Annual Report to be published shortly.</p></reply>

Increasing taxi fares, particularly the premium fare which is charged for journeys taken between 8pm and 8am or on Sundays / public holidays, is designed to encourage more taxi drivers to operate during that time, thus increasing availability to passengers nationally.  Whilst the NTA has statutory responsibility for regulating (licensing and enforcement) the small public service vehicle (SPSV) industry, taxi drivers are self-employed individuals and, as such, decide on their own business strategies within the regulatory framework.  Additionally, SPSV operators choose the times at which they operate.</p>  <p>  My Department and the NTA introduced several supports during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce the costs for licensed SPSVs to continue in the industry during the very difficult period. These included several extensions of the maximum vehicle age on an emergency basis.  The NTA also introduced a regulatory measure during Covid to allow licence holders to be inactive for 24 months (previously 12 months) to allow them to remain attached to the industry with no associated costs during this very uncertain period.  It is hoped that a significant proportion of these licences will return now that demand for services is increasing. </p>  <p>  The SPSV motor tax refund scheme was introduced as an additional financial support to assist the industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.  I provided funding of &euro;2m to the Scheme which commenced on 1 September 2021 ensuring that SPSV licence holders could receive a reimbursement of &euro;95 for their SPSV Motor Tax.  The Scheme will end on 31 August 2022. </p>  <p>  I also allocated &euro;1.5m to the NTA to fund initial NCT fees for SPSV operators for a 12-month period.  This Scheme also commenced on 1 September 2021 ensuring that SPSVs presenting for the NCT received, and continue to receive, this test for free until 31 August 2022. </p>  <p>  In relation to the number of SPSV licences issued or renewed, this is a matter for the NTA.  Accordingly, I have referred your question to the NTA for direct reply to you in this regard. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within 10 working days.  </p></reply>

A draft national charging infrastructure strategy for the development of EV charging infrastructure, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 194,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication.  </p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI). This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure. It will also lead on engagement with both public and private sectors to facilitate an accelerated roll out of EV charging infrastructure. </p>  <p>  There are a number of schemes under the draft EV Charging Infrastructure strategy which the DAA may wish to examine, in particular the Destination Charging Scheme detailed above. It should be noted that the strategy deals primarily with publicly accessible charge points and would not encompass private or restricted infrastructure that DAA may wish to install, such as chargers for exclusive use of taxis or chargers installed airside for the use of airport service vehicles.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme.</p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. For this reason, HTB is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to support the construction of an additional supply of such properties. For a property to qualify for HTB, it must be new or converted for use as a dwelling, having not been previously been used as a dwelling. </p>  <p>  A move to include other properties previously used as a residential home/second-hand properties within the scope of the scheme itself would not improve the effectiveness of the relief; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply. Extending the HTB scheme in this way would provide no incentive effect to encourage the building of new homes and would be likely to have a significant deadweight element and a high Exchequer cost. For these reasons, I currently have no plans to extend the HTB scheme to include such properties. </p>  <p>  In considering tax expenditures, I must always be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer. Owing to this, proposals for such measures are assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. The guidelines make clear that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, work by external consultants on the review of HTB is currently under way. The outcome of this review will help inform decisions on the future of the scheme beyond its current sunset date of 31 December 2022. However, that is a matter that will fall to be considered by Government in the context of the Budget 2023 process and it would not be appropriate for me to offer further comment on the matter at this time.</p></reply>

We are both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  We consider this the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions/mobility supports for those with a disability.</p>  <p>  The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, held its first meeting on the 26th January 2022. A stock-taking exercise of existing transport and mobility schemes currently supporting people with disabilities is ongoing ahead of the next meeting of the group. The issue was also discussed at the most recent meeting of the NDIS Steering Group on April 13th, which included input from stakeholders.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p>  <p>  I cannot comment on any potential changes to the scheme in advance of these proposals.</p></reply>

In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1/1/2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2- based motor taxes as well as CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  However, in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold.</p></reply>

In this regard, Revenue is prepared to recognise expenses incurred on membership of the relevant professional body as meeting the requirements of section 114 TCA, where all the following conditions apply:  </p><p>1. the duties of the employee and the duties of the employment require the exercise or practice of the occupation or profession in respect of which the annual membership fee refers;</p><p>2. the employee so exercises or practices the occupation or profession in respect of which the annual membership fee refers; and  </p><p>3. membership of the professional body is an indispensable condition of the tenure of the employment. </p><p>Where an individual is employed as a qualified accountant in either the public and civil service sector or the private sector (including accountancy practices), and the requirements of section 114 TCA are satisfied, where the expense is not reimbursed by the employer, the employee concerned will be entitled to claim tax relief under this section. </p><p>Detailed guidance on membership fees paid to a professional body is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website:</p><p>www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-02-18.pdf. </p><p>Further guidance on the general rule of deduction of expenses in employment is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-02-20.pdf.</p></reply>

Brokers Ireland has informed this Department that it has a dedicated information service for people having insurance issues with their thatch roof properties and has established a special email address to deal with these queries, which is thatchedroofqueries@brokersireland.ie.     </p>  <p>  Separately, the Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has indicated that it is currently preparing a study into the question of insurance for thatched roof properties, and that owners of such properties will be invited to contribute to this. All queries regarding this study should be directed to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government, and that it is my intention to continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance across all sectors in the economy.</p></reply>

This is being considered at present, and a decision will be made on the application in due course.</p>  <p>The Irish hare is protected under the Irish Wildlife Acts and can only be captured, tagged or killed under licence. The hare is also listed on Annex V of EU Directive 92/43/EEC (the Habitats Directive) and this listing requires member states to manage the hare sustainably. The Habitats Directive also requires Ireland to make a detailed report every six years on the conservation status of all listed species, including the hare. Ireland&rsquo;s most recent report in 2019 included a comprehensive assessment of the range, population status, habitat and threats for the Irish hare. The report can be downloaded at www.npws.ie/publications/article-17-reports/article-17-reports-2019. </p>  <p>The 2019 report states that the hare is widespread and common in Ireland with a broad habitat; it is found throughout the country from coastal habitats to upland heath and bog. The report does highlight some concerns about the loss of habitat quality due to agricultural intensification and afforestation, but overall the species was considered to be in favourable conservation status.</p>  <p>Following initial concerns about the potential impact of RHD2 on the Irish hare after the disease was first reported in the wild in Ireland, the number of records declined significantly. Only two positive records were recorded in 2021 - one hare and one rabbit - and one rabbit in 2022.  Nonetheless the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, together with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, are continuing to monitor for RHD2 in the wild in Ireland.</p></reply>

Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026. Our clear focus is to increase the stock of social housing through new build projects delivered by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) and, with this, to reduce the numbers of social homes delivered through acquisition programmes. On 19 January my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising that social housing acquisitions by local authorities and AHB CALF acquisitions in 2022 would be focussed on a number of priority areas, as follows:</p>  <p>  - One-bedroom units to deliver on Housing First and meet the short supply in this</p>  <p>  - category;</p>  <p>  - Other properties that allow persons/families to exit homelessness; and</p>  <p>  - Specific housing required for/suitable for individuals with a disability or other particular priority needs;</p>  <p>  Local authorities were also advised that limited acquisitions through the Capital Assistance Scheme will also be approved, subject to the available budget for specific vulnerable cohorts, such as housing for older people, accommodation for individuals and families who are homeless and for people with a disability.</p>  <p>  On 20 April, a further circular letter issued to local authorities in relation to social housing acquisitions. The key purpose of this  circular was to advise local authorities that I had reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions which are: (i) in one of the priority categories set out in the January circular letter; (ii) are in line with acquisition cost guidelines; and (iii) can be completed during 2022. The reinstatement of delegated sanction will allow local authorities to respond more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness. It is a matter for individual local authorities to identify suitable acquisitions in line with local circumstances and their social housing allocations policy.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management manages fire service issues in my Department. </p>  <p>  Fire services in Ireland are provided by the local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, 31 authorities provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide deliver local authority fire services, 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even when staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in other areas of the local authority sector. </p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms/ standards established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.   The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, 'Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.  </p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach, which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires that occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.  </p>  <p>  In May 2021, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management mandated a small internal project team to undertake a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;Retained&rsquo; fire services delivery. This review will have a particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff, with the proviso that due consideration also be given to input from the County and City Management Association.  </p>  <p>  The objective of the review is to explore and understand the issues that are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options that will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future.  </p>  <p>  The initial engagement element of the review is the gathering of appropriate data and information, to inform the needs analysis and option appraisals for further development. To that end, the project team undertook a procurement process and engaged the services of an independent consultant to survey the views of the personnel who work in the retained fire services and those that have recently retired from the retained fire services. In preparing the survey, the project team sought the views of retained services trade union representatives through the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group.  </p>  <p>  That feedback in conjunction with consultation at appropriate stages with all key stakeholders during the review process, including Local Government, fire service management/staff, and the staffing interest groups will form the basis of the final review report. It is the expectation of the project team that the final review report will be submitted to the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management before the end of the year.  At that time, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management will make a determination on the publication of the report. </p>  <p>  Following the delivery of the Retained Fire services review report, any recommendations made to the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management&rsquo;s Board, to address the issues raised in relation to the recruitment and retention of Retained Firefighters, will need to be considered with stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  Comprehensive updates on the progress of the report have been positively received by the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group. There is broad agreement that the survey outcomes are reflective of feedback received directly from Retained Fire service members previously, and that the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group remains the appropriate forum for feedback on the report as it progresses to its final submission to the National Directorate for Fire Emergency Management Board. </p></reply>

This is a one-off procedure and the RTB has assured my Department that it is working collaboratively and constructively with the sector to assist anyone experiencing difficulties.</p>  <p>  The RTB is experiencing significantly high volumes of calls, web-chat and action is underway to reduce these waiting times, with the recruitment of significant additional staff in its customer service centre, and the implementation of some technical changes to the online registration system which will ease some of the issues for landlords and letting agents.</p>  <p>  The RTB customer service teams are spending considerable time with landlords supporting their transition over to the new system and have been engaging directly with landlord stakeholder groups, over the more recent months, to support landlords, AHBs and property professionals understand the requirements to register annually. Over the past two years, the RTB has been engaging across various stakeholders listed and indeed others, about the change to annual registration and has established a short-term working group with IPAV which has met on a fortnightly basis since the start of April.</p>  <p>  The RTB has created online support materials  such as videos and FAQs for landlord customers to support them to understand the online registration system and annual registration requirements, which can be found on its website at: www.rtb.ie/annual-registration.</p>  <p>  Full details of the RTB&rsquo;s complaints procedure is outlined in their Customer Charter and is available to download from their website at:</p>  <p>  www.rtb.ie/rtb-freedom-of-information-publication-scheme/customer-charter</p>  <p>  Should further information be required by the Deputy, the RTB set up a dedicated email address for this purpose and may be contacted at OireachtasMembersQueries@rtb.ie. </p></reply>

These are the Historic Structures Fund (HSF) and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS). A third scheme, the Community Monuments Fund (CMF) provides investment in archaeological heritage, including older graveyards. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that neither the HSF nor the BHIS aim to allocate set amounts to particular categories of building. Applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis, so the total amount allocated to buildings of a particular type will naturally vary from year to year depending on the applications received. </p>  <p>  My Department does not routinely record the category of structure funded through these programmes, making it difficult to track over time the proportion of funding going to a particular category. However, taking the 2022 HSF as an example, 17 applications in respect of churches or places of worship were successful and awarded funding totalling &euro;816,640, with some due further funding in 2023. A total of 78 projects were awarded funding under the HSF this year, meaning 22% of projects receiving funding are churches or places of worship. By contrast, churches represent only 6% of buildings on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage. </p>  <p>  In relation to the overall funding for built heritage, it is worth noting that the BHIS and HSF saw a combined funding increase of &euro;2m (33%) in 2022, while the CMF received an additional &euro;1m (a 25% increase). In the future I would like to see these schemes continue to grow to the extent possible given competing spending priorities.</p>  <p>  Further information on the projects funded under the HSF, BHIS and CMF in 2022, can be found at the links below.</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/32ae3-financial-assistance-for-architectural-heritage/</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/press-release/136b2-minister-noonan-announces-over-4m-in-funding-for-512-built-heritage-projects-across-ireland/</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/press-release/b6787-minister-noonan-announces-2022-community-monuments-fund-grants-of-6-million/</p></reply>

As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme.</p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC follows a clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. At Q4 2021, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent.</p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 emergency, the HAP Debt Management Process (DMP) was suspended from March 2020 and partially re-commenced in October 2020. This meant non-payment of differential rent by a tenant during that time did not affect payments to HAP landlords. Tenants were, however, expected to continue to pay their rent with supports available for those financially impacted by Covid.</p>  <p>  Following on from the successful roll out of the Covid vaccine programme and the reopening of society, the normal DMP was reinstated from 6 September 2021.</p>  <p>  Tenants that incurred arrears during the Covid-19 emergency were given additional time to engage with the HAP Debt Management Unit to clear their arrears, as well as access to payment plans as a specific Covid measure. Under the normal HAP DMP payment plans are not offered or available to tenants at this stage of the process. The HAP SSC has now resumed the standard debt management process.</p>  <p>  The National Homeless Action Committee (NHAC), which I chair, was established in December 2021 in line with a commitment set out in Housing for All.  At the first meeting of NHAC, it was agreed that immediate priority would be given to additional measures to prevent homelessness. A number of measures have been identified and are now being advanced. Three separate subgroups have also been established to focus on specific areas of homelessness prevention. One of these subgroups is tasked with considering the risk of homelessness for HAP/HHAP tenants in arrears. Each subgroup has been requested to provide an update at the next meeting of NHAC in July and to make a final recommendation/recommendations to NHAC at its Q4 meeting.</p>  <p>  HAP tenants in arrears should contact their local authority and the HAP SSC to discuss the options that are available to them to ensure the continuation of their HAP support.</p></reply>

The project was carried out, under tender, by an experienced team of wildlife biologists and hare researchers from Queens University, Belfast. The aim of this project was to estimate the current mean population density and the national total population of the Irish Hare and to examine variation in its population across space and time (principally since the previous Hare Survey of Ireland in 2006/07).</p><p>The full report of the survey is published in an Irish Wildlife Manual on the NPWS website here: www.npws.ie/sites/default/files/publications/pdf/IWM113.pdf</p><p>The survey involved deploying static wildlife cameras in 44 x 1km survey squares. These squares were selected throughout Ireland to be statistically representative of the country&rsquo;s overall habitat composition. Multiple cameras were deployed within each of the 44 survey squares. Hares were detected in 85% of survey squares. As these 44 squares were statistically representative of the national landscape as a whole this allowed the researchers to extrapolate their findings to the whole country. </p><p>There are approximately 70,000 x 1km squares in Ireland and 85% occupancy of these indicates that the hare has a very widespread distribution. The researchers&rsquo; extrapolations were further underpinned by habitat modelling which suggested that virtually every 10 km square in Ireland contains suitable habitat for the species and should be included within its Favourable Reference Range. </p><p>The inclusion of citizen science records in the survey was designed to further inform the distribution model for the species. The 1,421 Irish Hare records that were submitted by the public through the National Biodiversity Data Centre supported the results of the camera trap surveys, i.e. that the Irish hare is very widespread in Ireland. These records were not used, however, in the population model which was solely based on the standardised sampling of the camera trap survey.</p><p>Using the camera trap data, methods were developed to estimate the distance of each hare detected on camera, enabling the use of distance sampling analysis. Distance sampling is a statistical package developed specifically to estimate the densities of wild animals. </p><p>Mean Irish Hare density during winter 2018/19 was estimated at 3.19 hares per km<sup>2</sup>(95% confidence intervals: 1.59&ndash;6.43) with highest and very comparable densities in the northwest (3.50 hares/km<sup>2</sup>) and southwest (3.46 hares/km<sup>2</sup>) regions and lowest density in the east (2.66 hares/km<sup>2</sup>). </p><p>The average estimate was 4.5% lower than the 3.33 hares/km<sup>2</sup>estimated during 2006 and 58% lower than the 7.44 hares/km<sup>2</sup>estimated during 2007. Nevertheless, such was the width of the 95% confidence intervals that the current density estimate cannot be said to be significantly lower than the previous survey. It should also be noted that hares are known to show significant, natural inter-annual fluctuations in population (as demonstrated by the 2006/2007 data).</p><p>The mean density estimate from this latest national survey was comparable to the 20 year mean density from all surveys since 2000 of approximately 3 hares/km<sup>2</sup>. This suggests that the population remains stable. The national Irish Hare population was estimated at 223,000 individual hares during 2018/19 (with a 95% probability that the number is between 111,000 and 449,000). The other figures provided in Table 7 of the report and referenced in the question (the Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals) are indicative of the extreme limits of statistical possibility and both the lower limit (60,095) and the upper limit (1,197,709) are considered to be highly unlikely.</p></reply>

Recommendations for techniques and strategies were made for potential mink control projects in Ireland. Some of these are now being applied, particularly in relation to important ground-nesting bird sites, including those in the Shannon catchment.</p>  <p>  For instance, NPWS is engaged in mink control measures on Scattery Island in the Shannon estuary during the bird nesting season.  NPWS regional staff have also been engaged in mink control measures on Lough Derg in 2021 and 2022.</p>  <p>  The review also highlighted the ongoing risk of mink escapes from operating mink farms. Mink farming is now being phased out in Ireland with the remaining few farms due to close, following the introduction of the Animal Health and Welfare and Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022 which prohibits fur farming in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The review also examined the likely cost of a mink control operation at a catchment level and provided figures that allowed the costs to be extrapolated to the national level in Ireland. Based on these estimates a national programme to control and eradicate mink today could be expected to cost in the region of &euro;80M-100M. </p>  <p>  Work is currently underway on new legislation in Ireland to strengthen the legislative and policy framework available to tackle invasive species. The Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future - contains a commitment to a national invasive alien species management plan. Work on this plan is in its early stages but there will be comprehensive engagement with other departments and agencies to develop a cohesive and effective response to emerging invasive alien species issues.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Ireland&rsquo;s fourth National Biodiversity Action Plan is currently being finalised and will build on the work carried out under the previous plan to manage, control and, where possible, eradicate invasive alien species in Ireland.</p></reply>

It will see 54,000 affordable home interventions which includes 36,000 affordable purchase and 18,000 cost rental homes to be delivered between now and 2030 by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the Land Development Agency (LDA) and through &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks. </p>  <p>  The primary purpose of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) is to capture a portion of the increase in land value resulting from the granting of planning permission for residential development. In line with Government commitments, the Part V provision was increased, via the Affordable Housing Act 2021, from 10% for social housing to a mandatory 20% for social, affordable and cost rental housing requirements.  The amended Part V provisions now require at least half of the planning gain to be applied to social housing provision, with the remainder to be applied to affordable housing, which can be affordable purchase, cost rental or both. </p>  <p>  The amendments came into effect on 3 September 2021 and apply to land purchased before 2015 and on or after 1 August 2021. Transitional arrangements have also been introduced and provide that the previous 10% Part V requirement will continue to apply to extant planning permissions and land purchased between 2015 and 2021. Near term supply will not be affected by these changes; however, this will change in 2026 when the 20% Part V requirement will apply to all land.  As this change applies to new planning permissions on relevant land, there will likely be a time lag between the application of the 20% requirement and the actual delivery of affordable purchase and cost rental units. The Department is currently making changes to the data reporting for local authorities in order to gather information on a systematic and consistent basis regarding delivery of affordable units under Part V and is not aware of any units that have been delivered to date which is consistent with development timelines.</p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that alongside the Part V arrangements, the Affordable Housing Fund provides exchequer funding support to local authorities to allow the delivery of housing at affordable prices or rents on local authority lands or via advance purchase arrangements with developers for new housing on developer-owned land.</p></reply>

This represents a 44.5% increase from 3,923 completions in Q1 2021 (when there were COVID-19 restrictions in place) and is 15.1% higher than the 4,926 completions in the last pre-pandemic quarter of Q1 2020. This is the most completions seen in any first quarter since this data series began in 2011. In the 12 months to the end of March 2022, a total of 22,219 new homes were completed. This year, the Government&rsquo;s target under Housing for All is 24,600 new homes.</p>  <p>  In addition, latest CSO figures show planning permissions for all residential dwellings are up 22.7% in the year ending Q1 2022 (44,491) when compared to the same time period to Q1 2021 (36,252). In the past 12 months (June 2021 to May 2022), Commencement Notices for 30,233 new homes were received. </p>  <p>  Together, the figures point to a substantial uplift in new housing supply in the coming years, as we increase output to average of at least 33,000 new homes per year. This increase in supply will be key to meeting demand, moderating price inflation, and addressing affordability for those wishing to rent or buy their own home.  </p>  <p>  Data in relation to the number of persons employed in the construction sector is also published by the CSO on a quarterly basis as part of their Labour Force Survey. This can be accessed via the following link:</p>  <p>  www.cso.ie/en/statistics/labourmarket/labourforcesurveylfs/ </p>  <p>  The construction sector is recovering well since the onset of the pandemic and the associated lockdowns that brought a halt to almost all building projects in the country. The most recent Labour Force Survey, compiled by the CSO, details that the construction sector now has 10,000 more workers than pre-Covid figures, standing at 159,300 workers in Q1 2022. This is over 30,000 more workers in the construction sector when compared to Q1 2021.</p>  <p>  Central to delivering on the ambition of Housing for All is the need for additional construction sector workers. The number of construction workers involved in residential construction will need to rise to 67,500 by the middle of the decade to achieve an annual average delivery of 33,000 homes.</p>  <p>  This will be achieved through a variety of means, including up-to-date forecast of labour demand and supply for the construction sector, and implementing measures necessary to fast-track sufficient numbers into the residential construction workforce. This includes, but is not limited to an integrated education, training and activation response, including delivery of new courses and apprenticeships, working with industry stakeholders, through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform-led Construction Sector Group, to review and promote the attractiveness of careers in the construction sector, recourse to international labour markets where supply is unavailable locally, including facilitating recruitment from abroad and changes to employment permit schemes where necessary, and encouraging participation in the Irish market by international construction firms and builders.</p></reply>

At the end of 2021, over 100,000 HAP tenancies had been set up since the scheme commenced, of which there were more than 61,900 households actively in receipt of HAP support. Of these, 463 were in Cavan and 566 were in Monaghan.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It is a matter for each local authority to determine whether the application of a discretionary increase is warranted, and the level of such an increase, on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, my Department was tasked with undertaking an analytical exercise to examine whether an increase in the level of the 20% discretion available to local authorities under the HAP scheme was required, in order to maintain adequate levels of HAP support. </p>  <p>  Following this analysis, I am working with Government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to provide for an increase in the HAP discretion rate to 35% and, for new tenancies, to expand the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons where required. Further details will be available when the engagement process is complete. These changes will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.</p></reply>

Irish Water as a single national water services authority takes a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment. The scope, prioritisation and progression of individual projects is a matter for Irish Water, and is approved through its own internal governance structures.</p>  <p>  However, the importance of protecting and improving Ireland&rsquo;s water resources cannot be underestimated. Having good, secure water supplies, comprehensive waste water services and clean waters are vital for protecting public health, supporting economic growth and preserving our environment for future generations. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I am pleased to note that the Stillorgan Reservoir has been modernised with the construction of a new state-of-the-art covered reservoir by Irish Water, which means that homes and businesses covering 200,000 people across South Dublin, will now enjoy a much safer and more secure water supply.</p>  <p>  The new covered reservoir, which can store over 160 million litres of treated drinking water, replaces three open reservoirs that were no longer fit for purpose as they were uncovered and presented a risk of contamination by not only birds, but also from other animals and human activities.</p>  <p>  The completion of the reservoir marks the culmination of a total investment of &euro;150 million in the upgrade of the Vartry Water Supply Scheme, which also delivered the replacement of the old Vartry to Callowhill tunnel in 2018 and the construction of the new Vartry Water Treatment Plant which was completed in 2021. The reservoir and associated infrastructure will have the capacity to support future water demand through 2031 and beyond.</p>  <p>  This work, progressed by Irish Water and the Local Authorities, is critical not only to the health and wellbeing of the population, but also to the development of the city, enabling us to meet our commitments under Housing for All, to create more businesses and attract more investment, by providing a more secure and resilient water supply for Dublin.</p></reply>

In particular, these require that naval vessels visiting Irish ports do not carry nuclear weapons and do not engage in military exercises.</p><p>In this instance, permission was requested earlier this month for the Royal Navy survey ship, HMS Enterprise, to pay a routine visit to Cork from the 12th to the 18th of June. Permission was granted on the basis of the conditions that I have already outlined, i.e. that the vessel not engage in any military exercises or naval manoeuvres or carry nuclear weapons.  </p><p>Nevertheless, it is customary for the crew of a naval vessel to be armed, including when paying a visit to a foreign port. The Firearms Act 1925 as amended provides a specific exemption to the requirement to have a firearms certificate where the possession of a firearm is on board a ship as part of the equipment of the ship.  </p><p>Security arrangements for such visits are ultimately a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with whom my Department consults before granting permission for a ship to visit.  </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding policy of neutrality is characterised by non-membership of military alliances and means that we do not participate in common or mutual defence arrangements.In this context, port visits like that of the HMS Enterprise are not indicative of anything other than our desire for friendly relations with our neighbours and our desire for the Irish Naval Service to be equipped to communicate with other navies where necessary. </p><p>On this occasion, the Irish Naval Service also availed of this opportunity to engage in a joint communication exercise with the British vessel in question outside Irish territorial waters.</p><p>I would note that the Irish Naval Service itself regularly visits foreign ports in precisely the same manner, including ports in the UK.</p></reply>

This is an increase of &euro;176 million on the 2021 allocation of &euro;867 million or, in percentage terms, a 20 percent increase in the overall cash allocation. Approximately 60 percent of Ireland&rsquo;s total assistance is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, with the balance administered through other Departments, primarily the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  My Department has been increasing its ODA allocations to Humanitarian assistance and Climate Change. The Humanitarian budget was &euro;107 million in 2021. Including allocations in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the food crisis in the Horn of Africa, the 2022 allocation for humanitarian action is currently &euro;126 million. ODA allocations to the Climate Unit have increased steadily rising from &euro;11.7 million in 2021 and to &euro;16 million in 2022, in addition to other climate action mainstreamed across the aid programme.</p>  <p>  Each year my Department publishes an Annual Report on how Ireland's ODA programme is being channelled to deliver the priorities articulated in A Better World, the policy for international development.</p>  <p>  The Annual Report contains a series of annexes detailing statistical information on programme expenditure collated in accordance with agreed OECD standards.  These show the distribution of aid, the amounts allocated to priority focus areas and the amounts given through the various channels and countries. The Annual Report serves as a core accountability and transparency tool, providing a comprehensive overview of expenditure under the aid programme, and demonstrates the results that have been achieved. The 2020 Annual Report details Irelands ODA allocation of &euro;838 million and is available on the Irish Aid website:  www.irishaid.ie/what-we-do/how-our-aid-works/where-the-money-goes/</p>  <p>  With regard to figures for 2021, validation of data on Ireland&rsquo;s ODA programme is done in arrears. Prior to publication, draft statistical returns are shared with the OECD Development Assistance Committee experts for assurance that Ireland's reported spending meets the internationally accepted criteria of what can be counted as ODA. This assurance is important in maintaining Ireland's reputation as a quality donor. The 2021 Annual Report will be published later this year.</p></reply>

Ireland's Embassy to Kyiv has continued to operate remotely, initially from Dublin. It is currently operating remotely from Warsaw.</p>  <p>  I believe that it is important to have a physical, sustained presence in Kyiv, as an integral part of our overall commitment to Ukraine, as it continues to face an unwarranted, illegal and immoral attack on its territorial integrity and sovereignty by Russia. Work is underway in evaluating in particular what security measures must be in place before our diplomats can return to Ukraine.</p>  <p>  My Department strongly advises against all travel to Ukraine, for any purpose. Irish citizens in Ukraine should leave if safe to do so. The capacity of the Department to provide consular assistance to citizens in Ukraine is extremely limited.</p></reply>

The exercise in question was due to take place from 21 to 24 June and on 27 June in an area of the Atlantic Ocean, off the French coast. The exercise area was relatively large, spanning approximately 250 nautical miles north to south and approximately 210 nautical miles east to west.</p>  <p>  The full extent of the area that could potentially have been affected included a small piece of the southern extremity of Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), approximately 200km southwest of our territorial waters. The French authorities confirmed to the Government that no French naval vessels would be within the Irish EEZ during the exercise.</p>  <p>  The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) was informed of the exercises via standard procedures and the Department of Transport issued a Marine Notice to this effect.</p>  <p>  While not common, such exercises do on occasion occur in international waters, including in a country&rsquo;s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).</p>  <p>  Under international law, all States are entitled to freedom of navigation in another state&rsquo;s EEZ, having &ldquo;due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal state.&rdquo; States are not legally obliged, in most cases, either to inform the coastal authorities of any proposed naval exercises, nor to seek permission.</p>  <p>  It is not for my Department to lead on matters relating to marine biodiversity. However, I do recognise the negative impact that some naval exercises, including those that involve active military sonar, could potentially have on marine wildlife. This is an important factor in the consideration of such exercises. I remain open to engaging with fisheries and other groups in this regard.</p></reply>

It is for the parties now, and those representatives that have been elected by the people, to come together to establish an Executive, and the Irish Government will continue to work to support this vital goal.</p>  <p>  I have remained in contact with the parties in Northern Ireland, and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland following the Assembly elections. I travelled to Belfast for meetings with the political parties on 11 May. I also spoke with the leader of the DUP Jeffrey Donaldson in the period immediately following the election. Furthermore, the Taoiseach travelled to Belfast on 20 May to meet with political parties and business leaders. In our discussions with the political parties during these visits, we discussed the importance of forming an Executive as soon as possible. I remain in regular contact with the parties in the period since those meetings.</p>  <p>  It is disappointing that the parties have as of yet been unable to agree to elect a speaker for the Assembly or an Executive.</p>  <p>  It is vital that nothing is done to undermine political stability in Northern Ireland, and that we work collectively in support of the institutions. In particular, the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to table legislation to unilaterally dis-apply elements of the Protocol is disappointing and deeply concerning.</p>  <p>  The protection of the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions has always been our priority. A constructive and solution-focussed approach is needed from all concerned, and the Government has communicated that message clearly and strongly to the British Government. The clear majority of MLAs elected are supportive of the Protocol. Work on formation of the Executive and on application of the Protocol should both proceed in parallel.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to do all in its power to work together with the British Government to support the full functioning of the democratic institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. I hope, as we all do, that we will see those institutions up and running as soon as possible.  This is the best way to ensure a peaceful and a prosperous future for all the people of Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Passport applications from all citizens - whether from anywhere in Ireland or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices on the basis of the type of application rather than the place of residence of the applicant.</p><p>Over 90% of all passport applications, including first time applications, are now being made through Passport Online which is available to 97% of all applicants across the world. The Passport Service is committed to continuing to offer a range of application channels, including an offline service for citizens who are not eligible or do not wish to use the Passport Online service.</p><p>Passport Online is the priority channel for applications as there are many efficiencies built into the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The Passport Online service offers Irish citizens the ability to apply online for their passport 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is a user-friendly, efficient service that consistently offers processing times up to 4 times faster than paper-based passport renewal applications.</p><p>Having a centralised passport system allows us to maintain the integrity of this vitally important document. It ensures that applications are processed by highly skilled staff who are expertly trained. The Irish passport ranks fifth in the world in terms of its security. It is critical that this high standard is maintained.</p><p>Passport Service figures show a very small number of applicants, less than 1%, use the in-person Urgent Appointment Service available at the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork for those renewing their passport.  This is mainly due to the efficiencies of the online system through which over 40% of adults using the service to renew their passport received it within 2 days.</p><p>Given the high percentage of applicants using Passport Online, I am confident that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants. Furthermore, recent service improvements allow the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. Given that that plans for additional passport offices are not under current consideration, a meeting would not be beneficial at this point. The Passport Service will, however, continue to consider ways in which to enhance customer experience for citizens.  </p></reply>

The theme for this year&rsquo;s Conference is, &ldquo;Accelerating the Elimination of Sexual and Gender Based Violence in Africa&rdquo;.   It will bring together high-level delegates from across the African continent with civil society actors and activists who are working to end Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) against women and girls. </p>  <p>  Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s Mission Strategy in Sierra Leone and cut across the Embassy&rsquo;s four key areas of focus - Nutrition and Food Security, Gender, Education, and Governance and Human Rights. The theme of this Conference aligns well with the Embassy&rsquo;s work to strengthen prevention of sexual and gender-based violence and access to services for survivors, particularly adolescent girls. The Conference also provides an important opportunity to advance the Government of Sierra Leone&rsquo;s commitment to reducing SGBV.</p>  <p>  As part of the Irish Aid grant to Purposeful for 2022-2023, &euro;50,000 has been earmarked to allow Purposeful to support and take forward follow-up work arising from the Conference. </p>  <p>  Irish Aid has not funded this Conference previously.</p></reply>

The role of the US Special Envoy to NI has been greatly valued by the Irish government over many years, and the appointment of a new Envoy was something I emphasised in my exchanges during my most recent visit to the United States two months ago. </p><p>The longstanding commitment to peace on the island of Ireland continues to be felt strongly in the US. The Good Friday Agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland are not simply an achievement of the Irish and British Governments and the political representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, but one to which successive US Administrations and Members of Congress have also contributed, on a bipartisan basis.</p><p>Senator George Mitchell, the first Special Envoy for Northern Ireland appointed in 1995 by President Bill Clinton, played an instrumental role in building the cross-community consensus vital to achieving the Good Friday Agreement. In the years since, the work of successive Envoys &ndash; Richard Haass, Mitchell Reiss, Paula Dobriansky, Declan Kelly, Gary Hart, Mick Mulvaney &ndash; has been crucial to ensuring the implementation and protection of the hard-won gains of the peace process. </p><p>The Government welcomes all engagement and support by the US in current efforts to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is upheld, and in that context we would welcome the appointment of a US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland. </p></reply>

I know that many families are upset by the publication and progress of this Bill, including those waiting for inquests or pursuing civil litigation. There will be many that understandably feel that immunity, conditional or otherwise, may be more about protecting perpetrators instead of pursuing justice and getting to the truth in such cases. </p>  <p>  We also have serious questions with regard to the Bill's compliance with international human rights obligations, and in particular, as to whether the Bill complies with the positive obligation on states to carry out effective investigations into unlawful deaths required by Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  The Council of Europe Committee of Ministers brought forward their examination of the McKerr Group of legacy cases at Ireland's request in light of the introduction of the Bill. The examination took place on 9 June. Ireland delivered a national statement during the debate, expressing serious concerns and questions with regard to the compatibility of the Bill with the European Convention on Human Rights. It is now expected that the UK will have to answer a series of questions on the legislation from the Secretariat, namely to explain how the Bill is convention compliant, and how it will gain public trust, ahead of a further discussion in Strasbourg in September. </p>  <p>  The right of individual application is at the core of the system established by the European Convention on Human Rights. It is not generally the role of the European Court of Human Rights to examine the compatibility of a state&rsquo;s domestic laws with the Convention in the abstract.  Rather, the Court examines whether the application of a state&rsquo;s domestic laws gives rise to a violation of the Convention in a given case, in light of the relevant factual circumstances. In doing so the Court will normally have the benefit of the evidence before the domestic courts as the impact of the state&rsquo;s domestic laws on the Convention rights of the individual concerned.  </p>  <p>  Any future examination by the Court as to whether this Bill, if enacted, is compatible with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s obligations under the Convention will necessarily turn on the factual circumstances of a given case. In order to do so,  it must be in a position to assess its practical impact on the conduct of an inquest, prosecution, civil action, or police complaint, and whether this gives rise to a violation of the Convention in a given case.</p>  <p>  In this light, discussion concerning the possibility of the referral of an inter-state case to the Court by Ireland concerning the Bill is, in the Government&rsquo;s assessment, premature.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that since the entry into force of the Convention in 1953, there have been just over 30 such inter-state cases. The vast majority of inter-state cases before the Court arise from regional conflicts between contracting states.  Ireland has only exercised the right to refer an inter-state case to the Court on one occasion previously (Ireland v United Kingdom (1972)). That case concerned practices which in the Government&rsquo;s view amounted to torture, in breach of Article 3 of the Convention, and was taken against the background of the exercise by the United Kingdom of wide-ranging extrajudicial powers of arrest, detention, and internment in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  As such, the case of Ireland v United Kingdom is illustrative of the grave and exceptional circumstances in which the Government will consider exercising its right to refer an inter-state case to the Court.</p>  <p>  However, the Government has consistently been and remains fully committed to engaging with victims and families, with the parties in Northern Ireland and with the British Government to strongly advocate for a collective approach to legacy which is based the legitimate needs of victims and that, crucially, must meet its human rights obligations. We do not believe that the Bill in its current form meets those important tests. We will also continue to engage proactively with the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on this issue and in support of families. Ireland&rsquo;s current role as President of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe represents a timely opportunity to ensure that concerns regarding the compatibility of the Bill with the Convention are satisfactorily addressed by the British Government. </p></reply>

The ACT-Accelerator has four intervention areas: vaccine development and sharing; testing; therapeutics; and health system strengthening. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the ACT-Accelerator has been via COVAX, the vaccine pillar. Our total funding commitment to-date is &euro;13.5 million, all of which has been disbursed. Ireland&rsquo;s funding has been earmarked for dose procurement by low and lower middle income countries; the transport of doses donated by Ireland; and support for in-country delivery systems.  </p>  <p>  In addition to financing for COVAX, Ireland has committed to donate up to 5 million doses from our supply chain, largely through the COVAX facility. Over 2 million of these doses have been delivered so far, the majority to countries in Africa. COVAX has been working steadfastly to facilitate the delivery of additional doses from Ireland and the EU although the chronically weak state of health systems in many low-income countries, and high levels of vaccine hesitancy, makes this a slow and challenging process. Nonetheless, COVAX has managed to deliver over 1.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines globally. This is a remarkable achievement in the 18 months since the global vaccination campaign commenced. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s financial and dose donations to COVAX are complemented by a broader response to the COVID-19 pandemic, grounded in our long-term commitment to SDG 3; better health and well-being for all. Our response to the pandemic has been informed by our previous responses to other infectious disease outbreaks, including HIV and AIDS, and Ebola. We know from our work on these issues the critical value of health system strengthening, the need to engage with and involve communities in infectious disease prevention and control, and the importance of sustaining support for pre-existing conditions such as TB and malaria. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have contributed more than &euro;100 million per annum to Global Health with a focus on health system strengthening in partner countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and through the UN system, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, and Gavi. These pre-existing partnerships have been leveraged to ensure an effective Irish Aid response to the COVID pandemic and inform and complement our support for the ACT-Accelerator, and COVAX in particular. </p></reply>

This tragedy comes at an extremely difficult time for the people of Afghanistan, with millions facing severe hunger, including at least 20,000 people living in catastrophic food insecurity.   </p>  <p>  Ireland has significantly increased its support to the people of Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, increasing our humanitarian aid fivefold over the course of 2021, from &euro;1.1 million to over &euro;5.3 million. In 2022, Ireland has provided over &euro;3.25 million to Afghanistan. This funding has been allocated to the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (&euro;1.5 million), UNHCR (&euro;1 million) and civil society partners Concern Worldwide (&euro;358,875), HALO Trust (&euro;250,000) and Christian Aid (&euro;143,785).</p>  <p>  Ireland also contributes to global funds and key agencies active in Afghanistan, including the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which has allocated more than &euro;68.6 million to Afghanistan since August 2021. This prepositioned funding ensures that our humanitarian partners can mobilise immediately to provide life-saving assistance to survivors and victims&rsquo; families. </p>  <p>  Minister Coveney announced on the day of the earthquake that Irish Aid funding will be provided to support the humanitarian response. We are in contact with our partners on the ground who are assessing immediate needs. I expect to be able to make a specific announcement in the course of the week on how best Ireland will respond this emergency.</p></reply>

The Bill requires serious and detailed consideration now.</p>  <p>  It is important, at this early stage, to make clear that the full incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law, with the ability to obtain remedies for breaches of the Convention in domestic courts, was a fundamental commitment under the Good Friday Agreement, which was implemented by adopting the Human Rights Act.  The incorporation of the ECHR into Northern Ireland law by way of the Human Rights Act has been essential in creating confidence in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political, policing and judicial structures over the past 24 years. It has proved to be a profoundly important safeguard.</p>  <p>  We are very concerned at any potential diminution of human rights protection in Northern Ireland, including any restriction of the ability to obtain remedies for breaches of the Convention in domestic courts.  </p>  <p>  Following the introduction of a 'command paper' last December that set out the British Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce this legislation, I set out my serious concerns very clearly to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in writing. I also raised these concerns at the most recent meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference in March. I and the officials in my Department will continue to do so, following close scrutiny of the Bill itself.</p>  <p>  In this context, it is worth recalling here our real concern that the British Government has chosen to introduce legislation on the legacy of the past unilaterally, moving away from the process agreed in the Stormont House Agreement. We have profound concerns both on the substance of the 'Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill' and the process of its introduction, and are deeply conscious that it has been strongly opposed by victims, by the Northern Ireland parties, and by civil society groups. </p>  <p>  We have serious questions with regard to the Bill's compliance with international human rights obligations. In particular, we have serious doubts as to whether the Bill complies with the positive obligation on states to carry out effective investigations into unlawful deaths required by Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  The Government is firmly committed to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement; this includes working with the British Government to ensure that all international human rights obligations are fully respected. We will continue to communicate to the British Government our deep unease at the potential negative consequences of the UK Bill of Rights Bill for the operation of the ECHR in Northern Ireland, and the potential non-compliance of the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill with the ECHR.</p></reply>

All air traffic, both civil and military, is monitored and controlled by the IAA in respect of this airspace and in line with international rules.</p>  <p>  The Air Corps is not tasked or equipped to monitor and communicate with aircraft overflying Irish airspace, military or otherwise and irrespective of whether the transponder is switched on or not. However, on a routine basis the Air Corps monitors and communicates with foreign military aircraft where such aircraft are flying in the airspace in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, where air traffic control is provided by the Defence Forces.  The PC9 aircraft currently operated by the Air Corps have limited intercept capability. </p>  <p>  It remains Government policy, as per the 2015 White Paper on Defence, that should additional funding, beyond that provided for in existing plans, become available the development of a radar surveillance capability for the Air Corps, will be considered.  The White Paper did not reference the development of an intercept capability for the Air Corps.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020. The Commission was established on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, and I, as Minister for Defence, welcomed the publication of the report of the Commission on 9th February last. It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and Defence provision in Ireland. It covers high level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.</p>  <p>  The Commission in its report envisages that should the Defence Forces at some stage in the future move to the highest level of ambition, LOA 3, then very significant enhancement of Air Corps capabilities will be required.  This would include the development of an air combat and intercept capability through the acquisition of a squadron of jet combat aircraft.</p>  <p>  Given the significant recommendations contained in the Report, detailed consideration of these recommendations has been undertaken over the last four months by my Department and the Defence Forces.  This has involved significant inter-departmental consultation, and I and my officials have engaged with key stakeholders to ascertain their views.

In addition to this, a range of duties attract additional allowances. </p>  <p>  The recent Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, which is significant and wide-ranging,  includes an examination of the evolution of remuneration systems and structures currently in place in the Defence Forces. The Report makes a number of recommendations in this regard, including on pay structures, on pay review, and on pay bargaining and ICTU. These recommendations are significant and require detailed consideration, and I will shortly revert to Government with a proposed response to them, along with a high-level action plan.

In addition, fixed periodic pensionable allowances and allowances in the nature of pay were also increased by 1% on this date. </p>  <p>  The agreement provided for further increases in 2022, i.e.:</p>  <p>  - The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1st February 2022.  </p>  <p>  - A general round increase in annualized basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500 (whichever is greater), on 1st October 2022.

This is primarily to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles assigned by Government, as set out in the White Paper on Defence.</p>  <p>  In this context, the principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements at home and overseas. </p>  <p>  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered as part of the capability development and Equipment Development Planning (EDP) process. A five year Equipment Development Plan for continued re-equipment was developed on a civil military basis and was published in June 2020.  The Equipment Planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging priorities, operational requirements and changes in technology. This is an ongoing iterative process. </p>  <p>  The development of a strategic airlift capability for the Air Corps although desirable, and while at pre planning stage, requires an informed approach and full consideration. It has not been prioritised in light of other equipment priorities and funding availability and no decisions have been made in respect of the purchase or leasing of aircraft in other roles such as a heavy lift transport jet. </p>  <p>  As with all capital investment decisions, costing over &euro;10 million, the requirements of the Public Spending Code would need to be met, covering the various steps required in assessing the viability of the proposal and those associated with relevant decision-making and potential subsequent public investment in any additional aircraft.</p>  <p>  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft with larger more capable aircraft, which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was signed with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019.  The cost of the contract, including equipment fit-out and ancillary support, is approximately &euro;228.3 million including VAT. The aircraft are scheduled for delivery in 2023. </p>  <p>  The principal role of the C295 is maritime surveillance, particularly fishery protection. It also enables the Air Corps to provide a wide range of services including logistics support and transport of troops and equipment, medical evacuation and air ambulance, search and rescue and a general utility role</p>  <p>  This investment in new Maritime Patrol Aircraft for the Air Corps, which is underpinned by the White Paper on Defence, is an indication of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that all branches of the Defence Forces continue to retain a range of flexible conventional military capabilities in order to meet the roles assigned.</p>  <p>  The Commission on the Defence Forces was established on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, and I, as Minister for Defence, welcomed the publication of the report of the Commission on 9th February last.  The Commission has undertaken a significant body of work, encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference.  It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and Defence provision in Ireland.

Chapter 2 of Administrative Instruction A7 provides another formal mechanism for members, under Section 114 (1) and 114 (2) of the Defence Act, 1954, to seek redress of wrongs or to make a complaint. Complaints may be submitted orally or in writing to the complainants Commanding Officer, or in the case where they feel themselves wronged by their Commanding Officer, may complain to the Chief of Staff. Notifications are sent to my office and the office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces formally when any Chapter 2 complaint is submitted and of its subsequent outcome. </p>  <p>  Under this mechanism there exists further recourse for the complaint to be referred to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces for investigation and recommendation if appropriate. The  Ombudsman, as the Deputy is aware, is entirely independent in carrying out his functions in line with the provisions of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces Act, 2004, and his final report, which may include a recommendation on each complaint, is submitted to me for determination. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement and Action Plan additionally aims to ensure that a transparent culture exists, that encourages personnel to report inappropriate behaviour, discrimination, bullying, harassment and sexual harassment. </p>  <p>  Despite the reforms that have taken place in recent years however, it is clear from the experiences shared by both current and former members of the Defence Forces that the culture that is pervading, and the application of these policies, systems and procedures for dealing with unacceptable behaviour have not, and are not, serving all Defence Forces personnel well.   </p>  <p>  This Independent Review is therefore a necessary and critical step to fulfill my duty of care obligation to the men and women of the Defence Forces, to provide a safe work environment. The serving members of the Defence Forces, expect nothing less. </p></reply>

Within that capital allocation the Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141m. Over recent years the capital budget has also been augmented through the reallocation of pay savings.</p>  <p>  There are a number of defensive equipment acquisition and upgrade projects for which there will be capital expenditure in the coming years. These include the midlife upgrade of the Army's fleet of 80 Mowag Piranha III Armoured Personnel Carrier vehicles which is well underway as well as the completion of the delivery of an additional 30 Armoured Utility Vehicles. The Army's non-armoured fleet continues to be updated also with over 220 vehicles due for delivery in 2022.    </p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, the programme for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft is well underway with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. Alongside the recently acquired PC-12 aircraft some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced capabilities.  </p>  <p>  The Naval Service Vessel Renewal and Replacement Programme is ongoing and the programme includes radar and other equipment upgrades along with the replacement of Naval Service Reserve motor launches. The programme of works for the midlife refit and upgrade of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n has been completed, while works are ongoing on L&Eacute; Niamh. Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of multi-role vessel to replace the flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, with work underway that will inform a public tender competition in due course. Two Inshore Patrol Vessels have been purchased from the New Zealand Government to replace L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Ciara, it is expected these vessels will be transported to Ireland in 2023 following the completion of a programme of works. The planned replacement of three vessels maintains a 9 ship fleet for the Naval Service.</p>  <p>  The Commission on the Defence Forces was established on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, and I, as Minister for Defence, welcomed the publication of the report of the Commission on 9th February last.  The Commission has undertaken a significant body of work, encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference.  It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and Defence provision in Ireland. It covers high level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.</p>  <p>  Given the significant recommendations contained in the Report, detailed consideration of these recommendations has been undertaken over the last four months by my Department and the Defence Forces.  This has involved significant inter-departmental consultation, and I and my officials have engaged with key stakeholders to ascertain their views. Following this engagement, I intend to return to Government with a proposed response to the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations and a high-level action plan before the Summer recess.</p></reply>

While the main day to day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, it also carries out a number of other non-fishery related tasks such as search and rescue, diving operations, drugs interdiction as well as many more. At any one time, the Naval Service can have a number of ships that are on active operations around the Irish EEZ whilst a number of others are undergoing routine resupply, maintenance and down time for ships companies.</p>  <p>  The Naval Service maintain a close working relationship with Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC (N)) the EU anti-drugs agency. In 2021, the Defence Forces, in particular the Naval Service and Air Corps received the MAOC (N) Medal of Excellence for their work in assisting in the interception of Trans National Organised Crime vessels transporting drugs to Europe.</p>  <p>  The Air Corps Maritime Patrol Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) using the two CASA CN 235 maritime patrol aircraft. These aircraft are equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment that offers aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish EEZ.</p>  <p>  The multi-faceted nature of the role of the Defence Forces in Irish life is an aspect of our Military that I am particularly proud of and this is a key feature of both the Air Corps and Naval Service. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020. The Commission was established on foot of a commitment in the Programme for Government, and I, as Minister for Defence, welcomed the publication of the report of the Commission on 9th February last.  The Commission has undertaken a significant body of work, encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference.  It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and Defence provision in Ireland. It covers high level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.</p>  <p>  Given the significant recommendations contained in the Report, detailed consideration of these recommendations has been undertaken over the last four months by my Department and the Defence Forces.  This has involved significant inter-departmental consultation, and I and my officials have engaged with key stakeholders to ascertain their views.

The minimum for trained personnel is comprised of Basic Pay and Military Service Allowance (MSA). In addition to this, a range of duties attract additional allowances. All Defence Force personnel also receive three additional public holidays over and above the public sector norms. These additional holidays are specific only to members of the Permanent Defence Force. </p>  <p>  In relation to Public Sector Pay policy, the Deputy may be aware that this matter is determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, having regard to Public Sector Pay Agreements.</p>  <p>  The current public service pay agreement, &lsquo;Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo; provides for increases in pay and allowances to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces. Most recently a general round increase in annualised basic salary of 1% or &euro;500, whichever was the greater, came into effect on 1st October 2021. In addition, fixed periodic pensionable allowances and allowances in the nature of pay were also increased by 1% on this date. </p>  <p>  The agreement provided for further increases in 2022, i.e.:</p>  <p>  - The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1st February 2022. </p>  <p>  - A general round increase in annualized basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500 (whichever is greater), on 1st October 2022. Fixed periodic pensionable allowances and allowances in the nature of pay will be increased by 1% on this date. </p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to addressing pay and conditions in the Defence Forces. The Programme for Government provided for the establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces, and the Commission's report included an examination of the evolution of all remuneration systems and structures currently in place in the Defence Forces, and made recommendations in this regard. </p>  <p>  Given the significant recommendations contained in this Report, I have been engaging with all interested stakeholders on the content, including my Ministerial colleagues, members of the Defence Forces, and the Representative Associations.

Leadership Training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensure that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations. Skills Training ensures that Defence Forces personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills. Career Training, and education, provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels. Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces. </p><p>The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training required to meet operational output and capability development requirements.  </p><p>The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms of the organisation against best military and academic practice. Military best practice is ensured by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and NATO/Partnership for Peace partners. Academic best practice is ensured by benchmarking courses through accreditation under the National Framework of Qualifications which is validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p><p>The Defence Forces deliver military programmes and modules meeting national and international standards and engage with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning. This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retain currency with regards to best international practice and employ all relevant modern training methods. </p><p>I remain committed to ensuring that all personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be trained to appropriate standards.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  Under the terms of the School Transport Schemes children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.</p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  </p>  <p>  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. </p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures in the current school year for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review.  As part of this phase of the review, the Department has conducted an extensive stakeholder engagement process. The Department is analysing the views of all relevant stakeholders so that they may be considered as part of the assessment and in informing policy on the future operation of the scheme. The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. </p></reply>

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. I have committed to seeking funding for further increases in the capitation grant in future budgets.</p>  <p>  My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie.</p>  <p>  As you are aware the Department has also issued additional funding to schools to support the implementation of infection prevention and control measures required to help minimise the risk of Covid-19.  The Department will continue to work closely with all of the education partners and public health specialists so that schools will be supported in implementing any measures that may be required for the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.</p>  <p>  All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements. Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie. which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p>  <p>  In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.</p>  <p>  This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector. </p>  <p>  The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.</p>  <p>  The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of  Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability. www.energyineducation.ie. Typically savings of between 5 to 10% are identified through low and no cost measures, while some schools participating have identified potential savings of up to 15 % or more.</p></reply>

The ADAPT Programme uses a professional external Project Manager to co-ordinate and drive the Design Team to achieve the best possible timeframe for the project through the stages of Architectural Planning, to Tender and Construction. The tender process to appoint a Project Manager has just been completed.</p>  <p>  The first step to be undertaken by the Project Manager will be the tender competitions for the appointment of design teams for a number of school building projects. This will include the appointment of the Design Team to progress the proposed project. The Department has recently written to the school authorities in relation to the appointment of the Project Manager who will advise of further developments in relation to the design team appointments.</p>  <p>  The project will provide for a new school building on the new site to accommodate an enrolment of 350 pupils plus 4 classes for children with special educational needs. The site will also be master planned to accommodate any potential future expansion requirement should this be required.</p>  <p>  The school in question is one of three post primary schools in the School Planning Area (SPA).  The post primary projections for the SPA indicate a requirement for 992 pupils with the peak year being 2023. This figure is projected to decline thereafter with an expected reduction by almost 100 pupils by 2027. The three schools between them have a total enrolment in 2021/22 of 962 pupils. </p>  <p>  The primary school enrolment for this SPA is projected to have peaked in 2020 with numbers seeking enrolment at post-primary level therefore expected to be reflected in a reduced demand for places in the three existing post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  On the basis of the above, the Department considers that the provision of a school on the basis of a Long Term Projected Enrolment of 350 will cater for the projected demographic demand in the SPA. </p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education acts in an advisory role to the Department of Education on the suitability of placements for children with special educational needs. Under the terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, the Department will consider the report of the Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO).  School transport is provided to children with special educational needs who are attending the nearest school to their place of residence that is or can be resourced to meet their educational needs, as identified by the SENO.</p>  <p>  Following the application process where there is a transport service available for eligible children, Bus &Eacute;ireann will liaise with eligible families regarding the school transport arrangements.  Where there is no service available for eligible children, School Transport Section of my Department will liaise with families with regard to sanction of a special transport grant toward the cost of private transport arrangements.</p>  <p>  While there are currently no plans to amend transport grant rates at this time, the Government announced a reduction in excise on fuel will resulted in a decrease in the cost of fuel.  The reduction of 20 cent per litre on petrol and 15 cent per litre on diesel will be in place until 31 August at an estimated cost of &euro;320m. This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time.</p>  <p>  The Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021.  The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway.  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.</p></reply>

Through this intensive intervention, we have seen over 300 special classes, providing over 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year. </p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special classes for students with autism in the Limerick area as referenced by the Deputy. Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years in this area to meet the demand for places. </p><p>NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for 2022/23 and beyond.

Due the disruption to learning and cancellation of the summer 2020 and 2021 Junior Cycle examinations as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic it was not possible for students to engage with the final assessment component which is set by the State Examinations Commission until this year. The cohort of students currently taking Junior Cycle examinations are therefore the first to have engaged with the full range of learning and assessment experiences in line with the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish. </p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing cycle of curriculum redevelopment, the NCCA reviews the enactment of subject specifications by conducting interim reviews once each subject specification has been experienced across the three-year span of the Junior Cycle. The purpose of such reviews is to capture feedback from teachers, students and stakeholders on their experiences of the new specifications. In February 2021, the NCCA opened a public consultation on draft L1 and L2 specifications for Leaving Certificate (established) Irish. In response to subsequent stakeholder requests, the NCCA extended the timeline for this consultation and also undertook to conduct and early enactment review of the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish. Accordingly, the NCCA commissioned Dublin City University to conduct this review which I am advised is expected to be completed later this year. The draft report, will in due course, be presented to NCCA Council for consideration. </p></reply>

The evidence available in this school year is that schools are willing to work collaboratively with the Department and the NCSE on the provision of new school places for children with special educational needs. </p><p>I am grateful to all concerned for their ongoing work in this regard.  </p></reply>

Due the disruption to learning and cancellation of the summer 2020 and 2021 Junior Cycle examinations as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic it was not possible for students to engage with the final assessment component which is set by the State Examinations Commission until this year. The cohort of students currently taking Junior Cycle examinations are therefore the first to have engaged with the full range of learning and assessment experiences in line with the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish. </p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing cycle of curriculum redevelopment, the NCCA reviews the enactment of subject specifications by conducting interim reviews once each subject specification has been experienced across the three-year span of the Junior Cycle. The purpose of such reviews is to capture feedback from teachers, students and stakeholders on their experiences of the new specifications. In February 2021, the NCCA opened a public consultation on draft L1 and L2 specifications for Leaving Certificate (established) Irish. In response to subsequent stakeholder requests, the NCCA extended the timeline for this consultation and also undertook to conduct and early enactment review of the specifications for Junior Cycle Irish. Accordingly, the NCCA commissioned Dublin City University to conduct this review which I am advised is expected to be completed later this year. The draft report, will in due course, be presented to NCCA Council for consideration. </p></reply>

These contracts are generally awarded on the basis of lowest tender.</p>  <p>  For larger or more complex school building projects, where it is considered that pre-qualification of contractors is warranted, the Restricted procedure is normally used. In the Restricted procedure, there is an intermediary qualification stage during which the numbers of applicants is reduced (or restricted) to a specified amount (normally 8 - 10).  The pre-qualification process uses a combination of pass/fail criteria and qualitative criteria to establish the tender short-list including previous projects of a similar scale and nature that have been delivered by the Contractor.  </p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.</p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p><p>In relation to SNA support the NCSE have confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs.</p><p>The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022/23 will apply:</p> <blockquote> 	a) The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31st May 2022 will be maintained for 2022/23. This will provide greater certainty for schools;<br /><br />b) A process for schools, whereby if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs, to engage with the NCSE. Schools should contact their local NCSE Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) to commence the process; and<br /><br />c) The exceptional review process undertaken by NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022/23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations which will result in one of the following outcomes:  	i. No change in the level of care need identified (and no change in the resultant SNA allocation);<br /><br />ii. Increase in the level of care need identified (which if significant would see an increase in the SNA allocations to the schools); and<br /><br />iii. Decrease in level of care need identified in the school (which if significant would result in a reduction in SNA allocations as the care need could be managed with less resources than are currently allocated), and the SNA allocation will be adjusted at the end of the relevant school term.   </blockquote>  <p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014 circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/education/2014/30.pdf. Following such a review and reprioritisation, it is expected that a small number of schools, e.g. developing schools, may not have a sufficient SNA allocation to meet the needs of their students. These schools can apply to the NCSE for an Exceptional Review of their allocation.</p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE Exceptional Review process is published on the NCSE website. ncse.ie/application-for-sna-exceptional-review.</p><p>The NCSE will endeavour to respond to all applications for Exceptional Review received as expediently as possible and in that regard, it will prioritise applications from schools with no current SNA allocation and developing schools. The Exceptional Review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2022/23 school year.</p><p>The NCSE has developed an appeal mechanism for schools who are not satisfied with the outcome of the Exceptional Review. Local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) will provide information and clarification to schools on the outcome where requested. Where schools wish to appeal the outcome of the review, they must do so using the prescribed form provided by the NCSE ncse.ie/ncse-appeals-process.</p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations for the 2022/23 school year and they are available at ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations.</p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, and the SENO is available to offer assistance and advice to the school. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

This includes additional teaching and care supports.  As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. Over the last two years, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year.</p><p>I am satisfied that this more joined-up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen over 300 special classes, providing over 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year.</p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special education placements for students with autism in Cork and the Deputy will be aware of the work underway to meet this demand for places.</p><p>NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.</p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for 2022/23 and beyond. There are specific plans in place to open both additional special class and special school provision and every support will be made available to progress their opening in the shortest possible timeframe with a particular focus on September next.</p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p><p>The list of special schools is available on the NCSE website at the following link:</p> <blockquote> 	ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NCSE-Special-School-Allocations-21-22-website-03-12-2021.pdf. </blockquote>  <p>and for special classes at:ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Final-2021_2022-Sp-Class-list-25_03_22.pdf.</p><p>As the query refers to an individual school, I will arrange to have it referred to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

While they had an entitlement to a reduced rate of Jobseeker's Benefit they were given the option of applying for Jobseeker's Allowance.</p>  <p>  The person Concerned was awarded Jobseeker's Allowance from 7th January at a rate of &euro;208. In March 2022, it became apparent that they had been awarded the incorrect rate of payment for their household composition. The Payment was revised with the Person Concerned being awarded a rate of &euro;123. This rate comprises of an increase for a Qualified Adult and an increase for 2 Qualified Children with a means deduction of &euro;263 applied based on the household income.</p>  <p>  In line with Department policy, all new Jobseeker's Claims are now paid into their preferred Post Office. The person concerned declared on their online application that Blackwater BR PO Killarney was the area where their Post Office was located, hence this is where her payment was assigned. Their payment has since been moved to Killarney Post Office.</p>  <p>  In relation to the overpayment that has been assessed, the customer has appealed the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office and the outcome of that appeal is awaited.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the current State Pension (Contributory) system includes a range of measures including PRSI credits, Homemaking Disregards and HomeCaring Periods to recognise caring periods (of up to 20 years) outside of paid employment in the calculation of a State Pension payment.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment to examine options for a pension solution for carers, the majority of whom are women, particularly those of incapacitated children, in recognition of the enormous value of the work carried out by them. The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund. The Commission's terms of reference included consideration of how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependants can be accommodated within the State Pension system.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7th October 2021. It established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed. The report set out a wide range of recommendations, including enhanced pension provision for long-term carers (defined as caring for more than 20 years). It recommended that long-term carers should be given access to the State Pension (Contributory) by having retrospective contributions paid for them by the Exchequer for any gaps in their contribution history arising from that caring. The Commission also recommended that relevant Departments should examine, in conjunction with relevant stakeholders, options for the creation of a statutory "Family Carer Register" which could, in time, facilitate the identification of long-term carers for State Pension (Contributory) purposes as well as assisting in the planning and delivery of services for family carers.</p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the comprehensive and far-reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission's Report need to be considered very carefully and holistically. My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system. The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare are being considered as part of these deliberations. Once we have considered all of these matters in detail and taken on board the views of my Ministerial colleagues, I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This pension is currently in payment and is the correct rate of pension commensurate with their contribution history. In the calculation formula for a mixed insurance pro rata state pension, the more full-rate contributions that a person has, the higher the rate of state pension payable. Conversely, the more modified contributions used in the calculation, the lower the rate of pension payable. The person concerned was provided with a copy of their social insurance record on which the decision was based.</p>  <p>  The person concerned may wish to consider applying for State pension (non-contributory).

In particular, there is an arrangement known as the six-weeks payment after death which allows for certain payments to continue to be made after a person dies.</p>  <p>  The provisions for a continued payment after death, for customers with a spouse/civil partner/co-habitant, are set out in Section 248(2)(a) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005. To qualify for a continued payment, the spouse/partner must be either be a qualified adult on the deceased person&rsquo;s payment or a customer in receipt of a payment in his/her own right.</p>  <p>  Where a person in receipt of a social welfare payment dies and there is an Increase for a Qualified Adult in payment, this payment continues for six weeks. Where there is no Increase for a Qualified Adult, entitlement to payment ceases upon the death of the customer.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that legislation provides that following the death of a qualified adult in respect of whom an increase of benefit is being paid for, payment of the increase also continues for 6 weeks after the date of death.</p>  <p>  Most social welfare primary payments include an additional allowance for a qualified child, known as an Increase for a Qualified Child payment, in respect of children aged up to 18, and aged 18 to 22 in certain circumstances. The provisions for a continued payment after death, for customers with a qualified child are set out in Section 248(2)(b) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005. If a person is in receipt of a primary social welfare payment which includes an increase for a qualified child and that child dies, the Increase for a Qualified Child payment will continue for six weeks after the death of that child. In cases where an individual has been in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment and an increase for a qualified child, both payments will continue for six weeks after the death of that child.</p>  <p>  Regarding in-work supports, the Working Family Payment and the Back to Work Family Dividend also remain in payment for up to six weeks after the death of a qualifying child. Eligibility may continue beyond those six weeks if there are other children associated with the claim.</p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer's Support Grant are the main income supports provided by my Department to carers in the community. </p>  <p>  - Payment of Carer's Allowance continues to be made for a further twelve weeks after the death of the person being cared for, including where this was a child.</p>  <p>  - Carer's Benefit continues for six weeks after the death of the person being cared for, including where this was a child.</p>  <p>  - Domiciliary Care Allowance continues to be paid for three months after the death of the child being cared for.</p>  <p>  - In circumstances where a person is in receipt of another social welfare payment together with a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then the half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will also continue for 12 weeks, including where this was a child.</p>  <p>  - The Carer's Support Grant, which is paid on the first Thursday in June will automatically be paid where Carer's Allowance is paid on that date. This will also include instances where the person being cared for has passed away before that date, including where this was a child.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

An exceptional needs Payment (ENP) is a single payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. An urgent needs payment (UNP) may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time. Government has provided &euro;45.75 million for the exceptional and urgent needs schemes in 2022.</p><p>The scheme is demand led. Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation, and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p><p>The Department is developing more extensive statistics in relation to the number of applications made to the ENP/UNP schemes. The focus of the development has been on current data from January 2022 with details on the number of applications available from this date onward. Details of applications pre-January 2022 are not available at this time. However, it is possible to provide details on the number of payments that were made.</p><p>Table 1 show the number of ENPs/UNPs awarded by county for 2020-2022 (end of May).</p><p>Table 2 shows the number of ENP/UNP applications received/awarded/disallowed by month to-date for 2022 (end of May).</p><p>This represents a snapshot of claim activity taken at 1st June 2022 and is subject to change.</p><p>My Department is currently running a major awareness campaign which includes national radio adverts to promote and raise awareness of the Additional Needs Payment.

The Government has approved the drafting of legislation to give effect to recommendations with respect the process of gender recognition for children aged 16 and 17.  Research is being commissioned to inform policy options with respect to children aged under 19 and all Departments and public bodies have been asked to progress positive actions to give effect to the acceptable use of pronouns, improvements in the design and content of official forms and documentation to permit the use of a third gender option, or no gender at all, where it is possible to do so, and to take any other positive steps to promote inclusiveness of person of all genders.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that some of the work being undertaken may result in proposals to amend the Gender Recognition Act 2015 which will be considered by Government in due course.</p></reply>

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.</p>  <p>The Expert Group engaged in a widespread programme of stakeholder consultation in order to review the existing funding model for Early Learning and Childcare and develop a new funding model. Over the course of the two year project, the extensive programme of stakeholder consultation engaged with parents, providers, the workforce, and other stakeholders, all of which is documented and publicly available. </p>  <p>Core Funding, which begins in September, is the new funding stream worth &euro;221 million in full year costs to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.  Core Funding allows for an estimated 19% increase in the total cost base for the sector.  </p>  <p>My officials have engaged extensively with provider representatives and providers of all types, and continue to do so, via various fora, as the details of Core Funding are available. For example, on 12th April, senior officials in my Department met with a group of provider representatives to discuss issues regarding Core Funding. </p>  <p>In addition, on 4th May, I, along with officials, met with a delegation from the Federation of Early Childhood Providers (FECP) to discuss their position in relation to the new Core Funding stream following a survey of their members. The FECP shared extremely detailed materials at this meeting, including case studies and extensive data on provider costs. My officials have examined these materials and issued a comprehensive response to the FECP. Furthermore, on 22nd of June I met with the FECP at Leinster House to hear their concerns. </p>  <p>My Department and I have engaged with providers throughout the development and implementation of the new funding model, and will continue to do so in the future. The next meeting of the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum is scheduled for 29th June and this will serve as a useful opportunity to hear from a variety and diversity of stakeholders in the sector.  </p>  <p>Core Funding is a new way of providing funding for the sector and addresses some disparities in the previous system of funding.  However, I do not believe that there is a solid foundation in evidence for the concerns expressed by some that Core Funding will compromise services' viability.</p>  <p>In examining all of the data available to the Department, including that provided by the FECP following our meeting on 4th May, there is no evidence about a significant lack of sustainability for ECCE-only services or to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding.  </p>  <p>Analysis of providers&rsquo; income and costs shows that services with the characteristics correlated with ECCE-only provision had the highest levels of income in excess of costs compared to other types of provision. Levels of income in excess of costs range from 14% to 23%, depending on the characteristic chosen. These figures compare to a sector median proportion of income in excess of cost of 4%. This was prior to increases in ECCE capitation rates and does not take account of the substantial investment in services during Covid-19 or the new Core Funding income that services will be eligible for.  </p>  <p>Accounting for the proposed Employment Regulation Order rates currently being considered, Department estimates show that services with ECCE and Core Funding, will receive income from the State that will cover the staff costs and leave considerable room for overheads and surplus, or for any service that may choose to raise wages above anticipated new minimum rates.   </p>  <p>Every year a number of services close and others open. Current data on service closures and openings are not markedly different to the trend in previous years. This data also shows that services close for a wide range of reasons including retirement of owners or other personal circumstances and only a minority relate to sustainability issues. </p>  <p>I am committed to ensuring more stability of income for services, and that is one of the key objectives of Core Funding.   </p>  <p>The vast majority of services will see an increase in funding, and less than 1% of services will see no change. No service will see a decrease in funding. For any service that does experience financial difficulties, a Sustainability Fund will be put in place. This new strand of the Sustainability Fund, linked to Core Funding, will be designed to provide an extra safety net for providers.  This will be open to both private and community providers.</p></reply>

The 70/30 Campaign target as referenced by the Deputy is believed achievable with the appropriate policies, actions and funding supports. </p>  <p>  In Ireland, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for children and young people 2014-2020 established a set of five national outcomes, for children and young people which all government departments and agencies, statutory services and the community and voluntary worked towards, to ensure a coherent response for children and young people.  One of these five national outcomes is that of &lsquo;safe and protected from harm&rsquo;. A final annual report for 2020 was published in January 2022, along with updates to the policy framework indicator set, which tracks progress across the five national outcomes. The indicator set report showed a decrease in the number of children classified as &lsquo;at ongoing risk of significant harm and in need of a child protection plan&rsquo;, between 2015 and 2020, as well as a decrease in the percentage of open cases awaiting allocation of a social worker between 2014 and 2020.  These five national outcomes will be retained in the next national policy framework for children and young people which is now being developed, and which will cover the period 2023-2028. </p>  <p>  First 5, A Whole-of -Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families 2019-2028 contains a range of actions to improve the lives of babies, young children and their families. It is a ten-year plan to help make sure all children have positive early experiences and get a great start in life.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the What Works initiative led by my Department, with funding from Dormant Accounts, supports a move towards evidence informed prevention and early intervention services for children, young people and their families.</p>  <p>  Quantifying the levels of child abuse in a country is not straightforward and different countries adopt different approaches.</p>  <p>  In most countries child protection referral or substantiation data is used as some indication of the level of child abuse but it is widely recognised that this is not reflective of the prevalence of child abuse. Estimates would suggest that upwards of 50% of child abuse victims do not come to the attention of child protection agencies.</p>  <p>  A new sexual violence survey is planned, which will be undertaken by the Central Statistics Office, and will for the first time provide statistics on the prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland. </p></reply>

Complaints regarding breaches of equality legislation may be pursued before the Workplace Relations Commission, which publishes statistics regularly on its decisions in regard to equality complaints disaggregated by discriminatory ground. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions, provides information on taking complaints under these acts and supports strategic litigation in this regard, including on behalf of members of the LGBT+ community.  </p>  <p>  I am conducting a review of the Equality Acts to examine, among other issues, the functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combatting discrimination and promoting equality.

The outcomes pursued under this theme include that LGBTI+ people are aware of the supports and redress mechanisms available to them where discrimination has occurred. This is being advanced through two specific actions. Action 9.1, which is led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, aims to raise awareness of the role of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) in dealing with complaints of discrimination under the Equal Status Acts and the Employment Equality Acts. Action 9.2, led by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in partnership with the Free Legal Aid Centres (FLAC), aims to provide tailored legal advice and advocacy to LGBTI+ people through a specialised legal advice clinic.</p></reply>

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.</p>  <p>  One of my top priorities in Government is to improve affordability of Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare for parents. The package of measures I announced in Budget 2022 is designed to ensure that fees to parents do not increase and that the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme are felt without being absorbed in fee increases.</p>  <p>  The Transition Fund starts this process and will be in place between May and August 2022. This is a temporary, once-off scheme, to support providers transition from the end of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) to the new Core Funding Scheme in September.</p>  <p>The main contractual requirement for the Transition Fund is that fees remain at or below the Registered Fees List that were in place on 30th   September 2021 for the period of the scheme. This requirement will apply to all services who are in contract for the Transition Fund. If, between May and August, a service has not imposed any increases to Registered Fees List that was in place on 30th September 2021 then they are compliant with the terms and conditions of the Transition Fund. </p>  <p>  Participation in the Transition Fund is optional but I am very pleased that approximately 94% of providers have now signed-up and thereby have agreed to maintain their fees at or below September 2021 rates. </p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic period, I was very concerned to hear of a small number of providers proposing to increase charges to parents at a time when the Government supported early learning and childcare providers very significantly. Fee increases that did occur during this period are unfortunate. </p>  <p>  The name of the service to which you refer has not been shared so I am unable to comment on specifics. I would draw your attention to the Transition Fund list which compiles the over 4,000 services/providers participating in the scheme, available here: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/core-funding/   </p>  <p>  Following on from the Transition Fund, Core Funding will begin from September.  Fee management for year one of Core Funding will start with the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels, and the approach will be further developed over time. I am confident that the fee management system, in tandem with developments to the National Childcare Scheme, will together deliver significantly improved affordability for parents.</p>  <p>  I would encourage any parent or provider with questions regarding the Transition Fund or fee management to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee for support and guidance at: myccc.ie/where-is-my-nearest-ccc.</p></reply>

In general, staffing pressures in the sector are caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of staff turnover, and recruitment and staff retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to pay and conditions, with for example the average pay being &euro;12.60 per hour in 2021. </p>  <p>  The State is not the employer, and my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff in the sector. However, I am doing all that is in my power to address the issue.</p>  <p>  In particular, I began a process in December 2020 to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services, which began meeting in December 2021.</p>  <p>  The outcomes of the Joint Labour Committee process will be supported by the new Core Funding stream I announced in Budget 2022 which will provide an additional &euro;73 million of funding in 2022 and is equivalent to more than &euro;221 million in a full year. Core Funding will support providers to meet the obligations of  Employment Regulation Orders that may arise from the Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services, improving workforce recruitment and retention through improvement in pay and conditions.</p>  <p>  In addition, last December I launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. One of its five "pillars" comprises commitments aimed at supporting recruitment, retention and diversity in the workforce, and it includes actions to raise the profile of careers in the sector. </p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Heather Humphreys TD, is developing an automatic enrolment retirement savings scheme which will benefit all employees including those working in Early Learning Care and School Age Childcare.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of affordability, significant investment is being made by my Department to address affordability for parents through the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). I announced a number of changes to the Scheme as part of Budget 2022. These changes will be of significant benefit to many parents. </p>  <p>  For instance, from 2 May, the NCS no longer deducts hours spent in pre-school, or school, from NCS awards. This means that parents may use their full awarded subsidised NCS hours so that their children can attend after-school services, which will benefit an estimated 5,000 children from low income families. </p>  <p>  In September 2022, the NCS Universal subsidy will be extended to all children under 15 years of age, so that all families will get a minimum subsidy of 50cents a hours, which equates to over &euro;1, 100 per annum for a child in full time childcare. </p></reply>

These are &euro;43.36 per hour for Pre-2011 Entrants plus 8% Holiday Pay (paid thrice yearly), giving an overall total of &euro;46.83 per hour and &euro;39.02 per hour for 2011 entrants plus 8% Holiday Pay (paid thrice yearly), giving an overall total of &euro;42.14 per hour. While these rates are those generally paid to tutors across the sector, I understand that there are some differences in the pay arrangements across the ETBs.    My officials are confirming the position regarding Cork ETB and I will advise the Deputy when this is confirmed.</p>  <p>  A range of industrial relations issues pertaining to adult education tutors have been under discussion for several years under the aegis of the then Department of Education and Skills preceding the establishment of my Department.   Significant progress has been made in resolving key elements, which include, the issuing in 2017, of a Circular in relation to an agreement to a consistent formula or method of awarding Contracts of Indefinite Duration (CIDs) across ETBs.  Agreement was also reached in November 2019, in respect of access to leave schemes, paid leave and access to the appropriate public sector pension scheme.   This agreement did not include self-financing tutors (who are ineligible for public service pension scheme membership) or those tutors who were employed prior to 2008 and who previously turned down the option of joining the pension scheme.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of ETBs to ensure the circulars are implemented. My Department will liaise with the Department of Education to follow up with any ETB not abiding by the conditions of awarding CIDs and welcomes any information the Deputy can provide regarding this matter. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education has regulatory responsibility for the ETB Sector and has advised that the application of pay increases to retired staff of the ETB Sector is a matter for the NSSO.   Officials have advised that the application of increases in some instances are complex and were delayed due to restrictions imposed by the pandemic.    The Department of Education has established a working group to work with the Sector and the NSSO and expects that all relevant increases will be paid by the end of the year.  </p>  <p>  The claim to align adult education tutors to a pay scale of an existing grade in ETBs remains unresolved. The Labour Court recommended in 2020 that the Department identify the scale of cost it was prepared or able to absorb and make an offer within those parameters given the constraints applying under FEMPI legislation and the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) in relation to cost-increasing claims.</p>  <p>  My Department is liaising with the Department of Education and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to finalising the official position at the earliest opportunity. An assessment of the costs involved in any alignment to a pay scale is being undertaken as part of this work. Officials met with TUI and SIPTU representatives recently and it was agreed that a Working Group would be established to assist in that work.</p>  <p>  Arising from the work of the group, I expect that my Department will in a position make a proposal to staff representatives in the coming weeks with a view to resolving this issue.</p></reply>

The increase of the deduction to &euro;6,552 as agreed by Cabinet on 21/06/22 will be reflected in the Student Grant Scheme for 2023 as it is only at that stage that SUSI would consider student&rsquo;s income that is earned in non-term time for 2022.</p>  <p>  While the 2023 Scheme will not be finalised until 2023 I secured Government approval at this point so that students could be informed of the proposed change and make them aware that they can earn up to &euro;6,552 during non-term time in 2022 without being concerned that it will affect their eligibility for a student grant.</p>  <p>  Income from an applicant&rsquo;s employment which represents holiday earnings outside of term time but within the reference period up to a maximum of &euro;4,500 for the 2022/23 scheme may be deducted from the total reckonable income assessed. </p></reply>

This can also result in some instances in fee grants being paid to institutions on behalf of students.</p><p>To mitigate the risk of over payments, SUSI implements procedural and system-based controls within its application assessment and grant payment operations. A highly developed quality assurance programme is implemented within the assessment process and a focused programme of independent post-assessment reviews are also performed across targeted risk areas.</p><p>The critical objective for SUSI is to identify and rectify errors on a timely basis before a grant is awarded and thus before any over payment can arise. Issues identified from quality and post-assessment reviews are fed back into the assessment process through feedback and training on a current basis.</p><p>The following table illustrates the amount of over payments in fee grants identified by SUSI in 2019, 2020, 2021 and to date in 2022. <table>    <tr>       <th>Academic Year</th>       <th>Instances </th>       <th>Fees Overpaid</th>       <th>Fees Recouped (from colleges)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018/19 </td>       <td>198 </td>       <td>&euro;336,853.89 </td>       <td>&euro;315,694.54 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019/20 </td>       <td>141 </td>       <td>&euro;261,579.89 </td>       <td>&euro;258,579.89 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020/21 </td>       <td>204 </td>       <td>&euro;310,418.51 </td>       <td>&euro;310,418.51 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021/22 </td>       <td>1* </td>       <td>&euro;3,000.00* </td>       <td>&euro;3,000.00* </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Data for current academic year (2021/22) may change as processing is ongoing.</p></reply>

Since 2016 the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased by approximately &euro;500m, or 33%.</p>  <p>  The 2022 allocation includes provision for a capital budget of some &euro;147 million encompassing an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ICT and Building Programme and ongoing investment in the organisation&rsquo;s transport fleet.  Budget 2022 also provides an additional &euro;10.5 million for Garda operational expenditure &ndash; including provision for new mobile devices.</p>  <p>  The ongoing provision of capital funding on Garda ICT infrastructure will support both existing and new ICT systems and develop them further. This investment will support the ongoing business and operational requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na enabling them to deploy the latest, cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) and is also the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote under the provisions of the Act. </p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na developed its Connect Digital Strategy in 2019, describing the necessary modernisation of their systems to enable police and support staff to connect to the information they require and to each other. This strategy also outlines how they can connect and collaborate with their partner agencies to achieve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s strategic goals and, most importantly, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can connect with the public whom they endeavour to keep safe. </p>  <p>The 2020 Data &amp;amp; Technology Vision builds on the Connect Digital Strategy to describe how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will deliver on the 8th   principle of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland &ndash; that Policing should be &ldquo;information led&rdquo;. The Data &amp;amp; Technology Vision has been agreed with stakeholders such as the Policing Authority and the Implementation Group on Policing Reform.</p>  <p>  Projects to modernise the technology available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are prioritised and delivered based on their impact and the resources and funding available on a multi-year basis with costs determined following detailed planning and responses to public tender competitions. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate funding for the Garda Vote, of which ICT programmes are a component, is agreed through the standard Budgetary process including within the capital provisions at Vote Group level provided in the National Development Plan. </p></reply>

Funding fluctuates based upon the YDPs' determination of their needs against the available budget for Youth Justice services annually. Therefore it is not possible to provide the estimated cost for funding one YDP for a year.</p><p>To be of assistance, however, the average amount of funding allocated to YDPs in 2021 was <b>&euro;174,000</b>.

Five high level actions were identified and outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, four of which have been completed to date. </p><p>The Department of Justice funded a group of restorative justice experts and researchers to map the delivery of restorative justice in Ireland, and to publish their findings on a new website. This website was launched in January 2021. It includes the findings of a mapping exercise, and around 35 case studies illustrating the use of restorative justice and restorative practices in criminal justice settings, among other resources. </p><p>Policy options have been developed for an appropriate mechanism and process to create awareness and availability of Restorative Justice at all stages of the criminal justice system, with consistency of service ensuring quality in training and practice. My Department is currently finalising a policy paper in this regard and intends to publish policy proposals soon.</p><p>Following publication of the policy paper and consideration of its contents, the next steps to delivering a mechanism and process to create greater awareness and availability of Restorative Justice interventions at all stages of the criminal justice system will involve the development of an Implementation Plan, in line with Action 98 in Justice Plan 2022.</p><p>Ireland is part of a Council of Europe initiative (Restorative Justice: Strategies for Change - RJS4C), which supports the development of restorative justice in 10 countries in Europe. Project partners collaborate with a stakeholder group of policymakers, practitioners, researchers, activists and other parties to co-create and implement new national strategies. The Irish project team comprises academics and a staff member of the Probation Service.</p><p>In October 2018, the Probation Service established a National Restorative Justice and Victim Services Unit which provides support and training to Probation teams across the country. This Unit is located in the Probation Service Headquarters in Haymarket, Dublin 7 and comprises a small team including 1 Assistant Principal Probation Officer, 1 Senior Probation Officer and 1 Probation Officer.</p><p>The Unit provides leadership and support for the consistent and integrated provision of a range of restorative justice models including family/restorative conference, offender reparation panel, victim offender mediation and &lsquo;bespoke&rsquo; restorative interventions. The Unit also provides a central point of contact for an effective response to victim queries and requests.</p><p>The estimated operating cost of the Restorative Justice &amp;amp; Victims Services Unit per year is &euro;220,021.70. A breakdown of this cost is displayed in the below in Table A.</p><p><b>Table A - Cost of Existing Staff &ndash; Restorative Justice &amp;amp; Victims Services Unit</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Officer</th>       <th>Cost</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1x Assistant Principal Probation Officer</td>       <td>&euro;89,025.45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1x Senior Probation Officer</td>       <td>&euro;76,816.06 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1x Probation Officer</td>       <td>&euro;54,180.18 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL </td>       <td>&euro;220,021.70 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition to direct support and training provided by the Restorative Justice and Victims Services Unit, the Probation Service provides &euro;627,000 in funding to four community-based organisations to provide dedicated restorative justice programmes.

A breakdown of this cost is outlined in Table 1.</p><p>The vast majority of RPOs are assigned to the 360 Hours Additional Hours (AH) band, and the cost of same per RPO is set out in Table 2. The Deputy may wish to note that premium payments are an average figure and the level of such payments payable to any officer will depend on individual deployment and work patterns</p><p>Based on the average AH and premium payments outlined in the table for a single RPO, the total estimated additional costs in terms of AH and Premium Payment for 300 RPOs would be in the region of &euro;6.1.m per annum. This is outlined in Table 3.</p><p>The combined cost of pay, AH and allowances for 300 RPOs over a full year is in the region of &euro;17.4m.  All figures quoted are inclusive of employer's PRSI, which amounts to approximately 10% of the overall cost.</p><p>In addition to the above pay costs, there are a number of ancillary non pay costs associated with the recruitment of a single RPO, such as training, uniform costs, subsistence and accommodation costs, etc.  These costs are set out in Table 4.</p><p>Therefore the total overall costs, both pay and non-pay, of recruiting 300 RPO&rsquo;s to the Service over a full year based on current pay rates, conditions and assumptions outlined above would be of the order of &euro;19.4m.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Housing Authorities have been key stakeholders around capital funding of new refuge developments.</p><p>In 2022 Tusla has allocated a total of &euro;164,354.40 to Roscommon Safe Link for the provision of services to those fleeing domestic violence.</p><p>Also in 2022, Tusla has allocated a total of &euro;1,538,319.46 to the Domestic Violence Service providers in Cork for service provision to those fleeing domestic violence. This includes funding to Cuanlee Refuge of &euro;510,999.</p><p>There are many factors which influence the average cost of funding one domestic violence refuge, including location and age of a building, maintenance, number of units, type of units, on site services for clients, security, number, and range of staff needed. This, along with the role of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Housing Authorities in capital resources, means there can be substantial variation in the average costs of refuge provision. </p><p>Tusla will work with the interdepartmental group established under the aegis of the Minister for Justice to consider implementation of findings from the domestic violence accommodation review. </p><p>Tusla acknowledges the need to increase the provision of refuges and that key to this will be ensuring organisations can access funding. </p></reply>

These types of attacks cannot, and will not, be tolerated. </p>  <p>  We live in a diverse and welcoming country and our laws and values should reflect this. I will as soon as possible, subject to Government approval, publish the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Hatred or Violence and Hate Crime) Bill to legislate against hate crime and hate speech and help ensure that Ireland is safe, fair and inclusive for all. </p>  <p>  The Bill will strengthen the law around hate crime by creating new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic. </p>  <p>  The protected characteristics under the Hate Crime Bill include sexual orientation and gender. </p>  <p>  Aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime. </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice is leading a number of important initiatives to ensure we better support all victims of crime. When a victim of crime begins to engage with the justice system they should know what to expect, be confident they will be treated respectfully and sensitively, know what their legally enforceable rights are and what supports are available at every step in the process.</p>  <p>  Central to achieving this is  'Supporting a Victim's Journey' - our plan to implement the recommendations of The O'Malley Review.  Supporting a Victims Journey is an ambitious plan to introduce important reforms to support and protect vulnerable victims and ensure our criminal justice system is more victim-centred.</p>  <p>  This year, my Department, with the support of the Dormant Accounts fund, will be rolling out awareness raising measures to reach people within marginalised communities in Ireland to inform them of the rights they have under the Victims of Crime Act 2017 and of the Victims Charter. In order to achieve this, my Department will work with various community organisations to adapt various assets and resources for victims of crime.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I have today received Cabinet approval for a new whole-of-Government strategy to combat domestic, sexual, gender-based violence. The goal of the strategy is zero tolerance in our society for violence against women and it recognises the need to reflect the lived experiences of particular cohorts of victims/survivors, including LGBTI+ people, and acknowledges the additional risks factors created by overlapping forms of discrimination. </p>  <p>  All actors leading on implementing actions as part of the Strategy will be required to consider the issue of access for these groups. This consideration needs to involve inputs from the relevant communities and the specialist and community based support organisations to identify and address any barriers.</p>  <p>  Separately, I am informed by the Garda authorities that as part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ongoing national response to ensure members of the LGBT+ community are encouraged and supported to make complaints to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when they have been a victim of crime Hate Crime, the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) provide assurance to members of the public in relation to reports of hostility or hate-based occurrences. This includes daily monitoring of all recorded Hate Crimes / Incidents on PULSE and Social Media, providing Hate Crime training, supporting investigating members, advising investigations and providing assurance to victims and their communities.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that in October 2020, an update to the Garda PULSE system introduced a number of measures to improve the reporting and recording of Hate Crimes and Hate Incidents on PULSE. The introduction of a mandatory hate-related tick box with associated discriminatory motives ensure data is recorded accurately. The introduction of the &ldquo;H&rdquo; hate-identifier allows for more efficient recording and analysis of hate-related data e.g. identifying trends, repeat offending and repeat victimisation. This allows for a more victim-focused Garda response. </p>  <p>  Discriminatory motives are searchable on the Pulse System which allows for analysis of Hate Crime data specific to victims who were targeted because of their race / ethnicity / colour etc.  </p>  <p>  The Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) forms part of the Garda Community Relations Bureau and has a very positive working relationship with minority communities in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Diversity and Integration Strategy is externally focused on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s relations with the communities that it serves, delivering on the obligations on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to human rights and equality under Irish, EU law and international conventions. </p>  <p>  Under the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are working to significantly increase reporting of hate crimes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by members of the LGBTI+ community owing to the more open relationship that has been developed. </p>  <p>  A new, non-emergency online hate crime reporting mechanism was launched by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July 2021 to improve accessibility to the Garda service for victims of all types of hate crime. It is available via the garda.ie website and provides a safe and secure environment for victims, who may previously have been reluctant to report in person to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

The Bill is on the priority list for publication this session and it is intended to seek enactment as quickly as possible after that.</p></reply>

This group includes members of the National Vetting Bureau in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and officials from my Department, Tusla and other relevant parties. The primary focus of the Group is to deliberate on and formulate recommendations to strengthen the vetting legislation in an effective manner. The Group is due to report by the end of this year.

My Department and the HSE, continue to review new evidence, research, and data on all aspects of COVID-19 including Long COVID, as it emerges to ensure care is in place for all who need it.</p>  <p>  The HSE has developed and is implementing an interim Model of Care to provide Long COVID services nationally. This builds on existing service provision to further develop the necessary services across a number of health care settings including GP, community services and acute hospitals. The first priority is to ensure there are Long COVID and Post-Acute COVID clinics operating within each Hospital Group to ensure a national service. This involves expanding the resources at existing clinics where required and development of new clinics in line with the Model of Care. Anyone concerned about Long COVID is advised to engage with their GP in the first instance.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that funding of &euro;2.2 million has been allocated within the HSE for Long COVID service development in 2022. Access to these services will be in line with the current approach across health and social care services.</p>  <p>  The HSE's funding for 2023 has not yet been allocated, therefore the level of funding available for Long COVID has not yet been determined. Proposals in relation to Long COVID and the associated funding requirements will be considered by my Department as part of the annual Estimates process later this year.</p></reply>

This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.</p>  <p>  Separately, I established a Public Health Reform Expert Group in January 2022 to identify learnings from the public health components of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland with a view towards strengthening pandemic preparedness and health protection more generally. It will also identify lessons from international best practice regarding reform and strengthening of other core public health functions.</p>  <p>  Since the start of the pandemic there has been significant and ongoing consideration of the impact of COVID-19 and the evolution of the response to it, as evidence and knowledge emerged and as national and international understanding of the virus evolved. Throughout, this has included a specific and sustained focus on older persons, and in particular, those resident in nursing homes. Various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons have been undertaken.</p>  <p>  In particular, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established in May 2020, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing approach to the management and mitigation of risk to older persons resident in nursing homes as the pandemic evolved. This report outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes, based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Four Expert Panel Progress Reports have been published to date, the latest published on 21 June 2022, and all Progress Reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. The LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

As such, there is an ongoing requirement for detailed epidemiological assessment and advice on current and emergent issues in relation to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses to inform and ensure timely and appropriate health service and other pandemic countermeasures as necessary.</p>  <p>  As set out in the weekly reports on COVID-19 which I receive from the Chief Medical Officer and which are published on my Department's website, the population and health service burden in relation to COVID-19 infections continues to be monitored closely across a broad range of parameters. These include surveillance and monitoring of the epidemiological position both nationally and internationally, hospitalisations, ICU admissions and deaths, surveillance in relation to current and new variants and assessment of health service impacts, including disease outbreaks in healthcare settings.</p>  <p>  In addition to the burden of disease caused by acute COVID-19 infections, it is recognised that persistent and prolonged symptoms can occur after acute COVID-19 infection in a proportion of patients. The number of people that are affected with longer term sequelae after acute COVID-19 remains unknown, but published reports indicate that approximately 10&ndash; 20% of COVID-19 patients experience lingering symptoms for weeks to months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE, continue to review new evidence, research, and data on all aspects of COVID19 including Long COVID, as it emerges to ensure care is in place for all who need it.</p>  <p>  The HSE has developed and is implementing an interim Model of Care to provide Long COVID services nationally. This builds on existing service provision to further develop the necessary services across a number of health care settings including GP, community services and acute hospitals. The first priority is to ensure there are Long COVID and Post-Acute COVID clinics operating within each Hospital Group to ensure a national service. This involves expanding the resources at existing clinics where required and development of new clinics in line with the Model of Care.</p>  <p>  Anyone concerned about Long COVID is advised to engage with their GP in the first instance.</p></reply>

This provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. Improvements to GP&rsquo;s maternity and paternity leave arrangements, increased rural practice supports and a support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, have also been provided for.</p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021.  258 places will be available this year. The transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) which was concluded in 2021 will allow for the introduction of a new service model for GP training in Ireland and the further expansion GP training capacity in the years ahead.

Data for June 2022 is also unavailable as June waiting list figures are not yet published by the NTPF. As such, waiting list data for the end of February 2020 and end of May 2022 is available on the NTPF website at: www.ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm. </p>  <p>  The NTPF only collects data on patients currently on the waiting list and the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected.

RSSMACs are contributions towards accommodation and maintenance costs, not charges for care services.</p><p>The features of the RSSMACs framework ensure that it is reasonable and fair and that each service user's contributions are based on what they can afford, taking account of the service user's individual circumstances to ensure the avoidance of financial hardship,  Rates are set at a level intended to ensure that each service recipient is guaranteed to retain sufficient income for personal use to support independence and participation in community activities.  </p><p>The currently applicable contribution rates are provided for under the Health (Residential Support Services Maintenance and Accommodation Contributions) Regulations 2016.  In each accommodation category, the contribution rates are based on sliding scales, with proportionally lower contribution rates applying to those on lower incomes. Standard RSSMAC rates are based on each service user&rsquo;s personal weekly income band and their accommodation category.  To make sure that contributions are affordable, the maximum a service user can be required to contribute each week is currently:</p><p>- &euro;179 &ndash; if the service user is in Category A accommodation (24 hour medical or nursing care) and their weekly income is &euro;228 or more;</p><p>- &euro;134 &ndash; if the service user is in Category B accommodation (weekly medical or nursing care on a less than 24 hour basis) and their weekly income is &euro;214 or more; or</p><p>- &euro;74 &ndash; if the service user is in Category C accommodation (all other accommodation such as independent living) and their income is &euro;208 or more.</p><p>If income is lower, the contribution payable will also be lower. For example, if a service user's only income is the Disability Allowance of &euro;208 a week, the most they will contribute each week is &euro;159 (in Category A accommodation), &euro;124 (Category B) or &euro;74 (Category C).</p><p>Additionally, section 67D of the Health Act 1970 provides for a waiver system in order to: </p><p>- avoid undue financial hardship on the part of the service user and/or on the part of the service user&rsquo;s dependants,</p><p>- advance a service user&rsquo;s identified needs (e.g. care plan objectives), or</p><p>- take account of separate contributions (if any) made by a service user towards his or her maintenance or accommodation costs.</p><p>To assist in the fair and consistent application of the framework, the HSE has published national RSSMACs implementation guidelines and comprehensive waiver guidelines (approved by the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform) on the individual circumstances where such contributions may need to be reduced or waived.  The guidelines specify that service providers must have regard to the individual circumstances of each service user and their dependants. The guidelines ensure that the applicable contribution may be reduced or waived where appropriate, taking account of each person&rsquo;s income and necessary outgoings, including reasonable regular financial commitments, with a view to ensuring there is no unfair burden on the service user or on their dependants.</p><p>If a service user is unhappy with their level of contribution, they can:</p><p>- ask for the decision to be corrected if a mistake has been made in an assessment,</p><p>- ask for a the decision to be updated if their circumstances have changed,</p><p>- appeal in writing to the HSE's National Appeals Office, An Clochar, Ballyshannon Health Campus, College Street, Co Donegal F94 TPX4.</p><p>If service users are not satisfied with the outcome of the HSE's appeals process or are of the view that they have been unfairly treated, they may make a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman, 18 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin 2 D02 HE97.</p><p>Comprehensive information about the RSSMACs framework is published by the HSE at: www.hse.ie/longstaycontributions.</p></reply>

The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system. Substantial planning, development and policy work is required to establish the scope, design and requirements for this component of the model of care. At this juncture, the design and scope of this aspect of the model of care have not been finalised as detailed consideration of a range of issues including service and treatment design, eligibility and access criteria, and associated resource implications is required. This work will also need to be informed by the final Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Act, the progress of this Bill &ndash; which passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in March &ndash; and associated regulations that will be developed following the enactment of this legislation.

It is recognised that most patients with COVID-19 return to baseline after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, but a proportion report ongoing health issues.</p>  <p>  The number of people that are affected with longer term sequelae after acute COVID-19 remains unknown, but published reports indicate that approximately 10&ndash; 20% of COVID-19 patients experience lingering symptoms for weeks to months following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection may be followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate. </p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE, continue to review new evidence, research and data on all aspects of COVID19 including Long COVID, as it emerges to ensure care is in place for all who need it.</p>  <p>  The HSE has developed and is implementing an interim Model of Care to provide Long COVID services nationally. This builds on existing service provision to further develop the necessary services across a number of health care settings including GP, community services and acute hospitals. The first priority is to ensure there are Long COVID and Post-Acute COVID clinics operating within each Hospital Group to ensure a national service. This involves expanding the resources at existing clinics where required and development of new clinics in line with the Model of Care. </p>  <p>  A HSE National Implementation Team has been established to lead the implementation of the Model of Care and clinical leads representing the areas of respiratory medicine, infectious diseases, neurology, mental health, allied health professionals, community services and general practice have been appointed. In some incidences, clinics have been established on an interim basis within existing resources until staffing provided through the model of care becomes available. The objective is to provide a full national service to ensure those who need care have access to it. </p>  <p>  Anyone concerned about Long COVID is advised to engage with their GP in the first instance.</p></reply>

It was chaired by the High Court judge, Mr. Justice Charles Meenan. The expert group examined the system from the perspective of the person who has made the claim to explore if there is a better way to deal effectively, yet more sensitively, with certain cases.  </p>  <p>  Mr. Justice Meenan submitted the final report on the current system for managing clinical negligence claims to the then Minister for Health and Minister for Justice in January 2020, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Government subsequently published the Meenan report in December 2020. One of the report's recommendations is that a compensation scheme be established.   </p>  <p>  On foot of a request from the Department of Health, the Health Research Board (HRB), carried out an evidence review on the vaccine injury redress programme in other jurisdictions, which was completed in March 2019. The expert group's report, in addition to the HRB's evidence review, and consultation with other Departments and relevant State agencies will inform the development of proposals regarding the establishment of a compensation scheme, including the need for primary legislation.  </p>  <p>  While some preliminary scoping work has been undertaken by the Department, during the pandemic all available Department of Health resources were devoted to the Public Health response. This has meant that progress on the development of policy in this area could not be progressed as intended.    </p>  <p>  There is still significant work required to develop proposals for consideration by Government regarding vaccine damage compensation. </p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p>  <p>  The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. Rolling out the payment to eligible non-HSE and non-Section 38 employees is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department and the HSE are prioritising the work needed to progress this. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p>  <p>  1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p>  <p>  2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p>  <p>  3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p>  <p>  4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p>  <p>  5. Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p>  <p>  6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Government is mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.</p></reply>

It can also help to reduce social isolation.  While the use of the Boarding Out Scheme by the HSE has traditionally been small I consider there is value in exploring it further.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously advised the Deputy, I have requested that officials in the Department consider this model of care in the context of our overall commitment to enhancing opportunities for older people to stay in their homes and communities for longer.  Unfortunately, due to competing pressures, there has been a delay in commencing this piece of work, however preliminary scoping work of the Scheme is expected to commence shortly which will include consideration of the Regulations and the financial arrangements in place with the providers.</p></reply>

For this reason, it is not possible to give an estimate of the cost of extending GP care without fees to all children aged under 9 years of age. Similarly, it is not possible to give an estimate of the cost of extending GP care without fees to further cohorts of the population.</p></reply>

Since the scale, complexity, and investment proposed now is much greater than the original proposal, this major project must be subject to the necessary scrutiny under the Public Spending Code (PSC) for projects in excess of &euro;100m.</p>  <p>  The PSC is designed to ensure that investment decisions are underpinned by a clear policy rationale, and that costs are well understood. In 2019, the PSC was updated and introduced a new project lifecycle, tightening the arrangements for project decision-making, and clarifying the roles of the parties involved including the responsibilities for Sponsoring Agencies and Approving Authorities.</p>  <p>  These are defined processes in which all Departments and agencies are subject to and must follow to ensure that Government, as the approving authority for all major projects, can be satisfied that the project is the best means to achieve a policy goal and that we achieve maximum value for money for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  The HSE is nearing completion of drafting a Strategic Assessment Report, to ensure full compliance with PSC requirements for the more substantial proposals. It is now expected to be submitted to my Department by early Q3 2022 for review and, if Departmental review is successful, to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (D/PER) for review in due course in line with PSC Gate 0 requirements. This additional scrutiny, required under the PSC, can ensure fuller risk mitigation, early identification of potential obstacles, and smoother execution of later stages of the project lifecycle.</p>  <p>  If approval-in principle is granted, the preliminary business case can  be updated by the HSE and be brought forward for PSC Gate 1 review.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, approval was given for the Galway University Hospital interim emergency department, including additional resuscitation spaces, support accommodation and improved infection prevention and control measures. This is currently under construction using a rapid build solution. The critical services are now expected to be completed in the coming weeks (July 2022). This interim ED and associated works will also serve as enabling works for the larger project; freeing up the site required for the proposed new block.</p></reply>

There is no longer a public health rationale or need for extensive testing, case finding and tracing of infection to reduce COVID-19 transmission. The focus now is on mitigation of the severe impacts of COVID-19 for those most vulnerable to the disease and those with risk factors who may benefit from specific interventions. Full details of the current public health advice are available on the website of the HSE at www.hse.ie. The public health advice relating to testing and tracing is kept under continuing review having regard to the evolving epidemiological situation, the impact of the disease on healthcare utilisation and outcomes, the vaccination status of the population, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidance and other international evidence and guidance.</p>  <p>  The HSE is working to implement this advice which is invariably leading to consolidation of resources around the country as the HSE moves through the transition phases of the programme. The arrangements with regard to the number of positions available, and the nature of the work that will be carried out is a matter for the Health Service Executive, and I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly in this regard, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Both I and the Government have been concerned for some time that medical card patients in some parts of the country have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services. The problem became particularly acute over the last couple of years as a significant number of contracted dentists chose to opt out of the DTSS. </p>  <p>  I secured an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders including the reintroduction of Scale and Polish. I am also using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s estimate allocation (&euro;56 million) to award fee increases across a number of items including fillings and restorations. The combination of these two measures, which came into effect on 1st May, represents an estimated total additional investment of &euro;26 million in the DTSS this year over and above what was spent on the Scheme in 2021, &euro;40 million.</p>  <p>  While it is a matter for each individual dentist to decide whether to accept new patients, I hope that this significant additional investment in the scheme will attract more dentists to treat medical card patients, including in Mayo. These measures are designed to address immediate concerns with the Scheme, pending a more substantive reform of dental services to align with the National Oral Health Policy.</p>  <p>  I have been assured by the HSE that their local services on the ground will assist any persons who are still experiencing problems in accessing a service.</p></reply>

GPs who wish to provide termination of pregnancy services may enter into a contract with the HSE to do so.  Given this contractual arrangement, GPs are not required to register as conscientious objectors and the number of same is therefore not available. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the manpower issues facing general practice and has taken measures to increase the number of GPs working in the State and consequently increase service capacity within general practice. As GPs are private practitioners, information is not held in regard to the capacity available at individual practices to provide certain services, however provision of the service concerned would not be considered as having a large impact on practice capacity. GPs are reimbursed by the HSE for services provided under the Termination of Pregnancy Service contract.</p></reply>

There is no longer a public health rationale or need for extensive testing, case finding and tracing of infection to reduce COVID-19 transmission. The focus now is on mitigation of the severe impacts of COVID-19 for those most vulnerable to the disease and those with risk factors who may benefit from specific interventions. Full details of the current public health advice are available on the website of the HSE at www.hse.ie. The public health advice relating to testing and tracing is kept under continuing review having regard to the evolving epidemiological situation, the impact of the disease on healthcare utilisation and outcomes, the vaccination status of the population, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidance and other international evidence and guidance.</p>  <p>  The HSE is working to implement this advice which is invariably leading to consolidation of resources around the country as the HSE moves through the transition phases of the programme. The arrangements with regard to the number of positions available, and the nature of the work that will be carried out is a matter for the Health Service Executive, and I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly in this regard, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This independent expert group considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria. It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms.</p>  <p>  It may be of interest to note that the NSAC held its first 'Annual Call&rsquo; in 2021, which gave the public an opportunity to suggest new screening programmes or modifications to existing ones and the Committee are currently reviewing the submissions received. I will be guided by their advice to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s population-based screening programmes continue to evolve in line with new evidence and developments.</p>  <p>  It is important to remember that screening is for healthy people without symptoms. If anyone becomes aware of symptoms, or if they have concerns or worries, they should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care.</p>  <p>  Moreover, in 2018, the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services was established by the Minister for Health to review the delivery of cardiac services nationally. The Review seeks to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality, and sustainability of the services that patients receive.  The Review considers the delivery of all cardiac services nationally.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group is currently working on the development of the proposed recommendations of the draft Report. Any newly proposed cardiovascular health screening recommendations resulting from the Review will be subject to consideration and advice of NSAC.</p></reply>

However, as restrictions began to ease, it became timely to revisit the Model of Care to review its operation and consider whether remote consultation as part of a blended approach to termination of pregnancy care should be continued post the COVID-19 public health emergency period. At the request of the Department, the HSE conducted a review of the Revised Model of Care for Termination of Pregnancy, examining patient safety aspects, with input from service providers in both hospital and community settings. The Department is continuing its engagements with the HSE regarding the final considerations related to this review and the next steps. </p>  <p>  The outcome of the review will be made available once this deliberative process concludes.</p>  <p>  It is important to reflect that COVID-19 is still with us and Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) guidance on Managing Risk of Transmission of Respiratory Viruses including COVID-19, continues to advise, amongst other things, to limit footfall in General Practice settings and support telephone consultations where care that meets the needs of the patient can be delivered - this helps to eliminate the risk of transmission of viral infection. As such the arrangements for remote access to this service in the context of COVID-19 remain in place, in the context of the wider public health guidance.</p></reply>

The NSAC has commissioned HIQA to undertake a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) looking at the addition of other SCID types to the NBS programme. This HTA is underway and I am looking forward to receiving a recommendation from the Committee on this condition after the HTA process is finalised later this year.</p>  <p>  The NSAC is now well established and recently published its second annual report which detailed significant progress in 2021. The Committee's first Annual Call for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes, received a significant response with a total of 53 submissions received, including on newborn screening. Submissions were received from various sources and are now undergoing consideration by the committee. The NSAC intends to publish its full work programme later this year once it has considered all proposals submitted.</p>  <p>  Given that this is a complex area, careful consideration must be given to the expansion of the NBS programme and these things can take time, however, it is important that decisions are made based on internationally accepted criteria and scientific rigour.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of how difficult it is for parents whose children have received a diagnosis of a rare disease, and how challenging daily life can be for them, their families and their children. It can be an overwhelming situation and can be very isolating for many families because of the significant work that is involved when a rare disease is diagnosed. I am committed to the further expansion of newborn screening in Ireland and in identifying opportunities for future additions to it.</p></reply>

The plans align to the five Strategic Objectives as outlined in the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Action Plan (2015) and the requirements of the European Action Plan on AMR (2017).</p><p>iNAP2 includes 90 actions specific to human health across the 5 WHO Strategic Objectives, along with 15 One Health actions agreed across the human health, animal health and environment sectors. </p><p><b>Ireland's National Interdepartmental Antimicrobial Resistance Consultative Committee</b></p><p>The Department of Health has worked with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as part of a One Health Approach to tackling AMR since 2014 when the National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee was established.  It is co-chaired by the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Veterinary Officer.</p><p>The Committee has served as an AMR One Health committee and the membership is made up of both Government Departments, key stakeholders, and agencies from the three One Health sectors including representation from the environment sector.

The national CPE reference laboratory service (NCPERLS) was established in 2012. In response to a rising number of cases in 2016, a Public Health Emergency was declared in October 2017 and the National Public Health Emergency Team CPE (NPHET-CPE) was subsequently convened. </p><p>In 2018 CPE was added to the statutory list of notifiable diseases, which physicians are legally required to submit information to the HSE HPSC when a case is identified. This enables more accurate and timely data to be compiled at a national level. Enhanced surveillance, clinical guidance, provision of screening and allocation of targeted resources were operationalised in 2018 and 2019 in response to this emergency. These initiatives, together with the collaborative work of the NPHET-CPE, DOH, HSE AMRIC, HPSC and the professional healthcare community have led to incidence of CPE stabilising across 2019, 2020 and 2021. The surveillance, screening, monitoring and management of CPE is now integrated into the day-to-day operations of the health service. </p><p>CPE testing is ongoing with a target of 25,000 CPE screening tests per month. The HSE maintained a high level of testing during the pandemic and continues to exceed this target. Further information regarding CPE, including the CPE Monthly Surveillance Reports, can be found on the Health Protection Surveillance Centre's website, www.hpsc.ie/a-z/microbiologyantimicrobialresistance/strategyforthecontrolofantimicrobialresistanceinirelandsari/carbapenemresistantenterobacteriaceaecre/surveillanceofcpeinireland/cpemonthlysurveillancereports/.</p></reply>

The design of citizen engagement information and publicity campaigns to support and promote the roll out of the scheme will be finalised in the coming weeks, to be launched in the month preceding and during the initial phase of scheme roll-out.</p><p>Consultations with representative bodies for the pharmacy sector will commence shortly. It is envisaged that these discussions will concern service provision for the scheme. It should be noted that the regulatory framework in Ireland does not currently permit dispensing the Pill without a prescription; amending this would require expert clinical input. It is not envisaged that this could be considered prior to the launch of the scheme, given the tight timelines involved. </p><p>However, scheme implementation will be subject to monitoring and evaluation, following launch, and prior to any widening of age cohorts.

These ceilings enable payment of market value compensation for the vast majority of animals within the scope of available exchequer and farmer levy funding.</p>  <p>  In addition to the On Farm Market Valuation compensation package, Depopulation Grants may be paid to eligible herd-owners whose herds are depopulated (totally or partially). The grant is paid per animal removed in the depopulation measure and for those removed as reactors since the holding was restricted, on condition that the herd-owner agrees to the depopulation at the time specified by the Department.</p>  <p>  As part of the work of the TB Forum, a dedicated Financial Working Group comprising representatives from my Department and the farming organisations was established 15 months ago to review the current financial model of the TB programme. Their remit includes a review of compensation schemes with respect to all types of bovine herds. </p>  <p>  Recommendations from the Finance Working Group will be submitted to the TB Forum for consideration.</p>  <p>  Herd owners in possession of very valuable animals should give careful consideration to mitigating their risks by taking out insurance, thereby enabling them to recover the full market value of such animals in the event of an outbreak of TB in their herd.</p></reply>

This figure includes temporary staff, seconded staff and staff on leave of absence.  If these categories are removed, the number is reduced to 3,888.  Throughout the pandemic, approximately half of my staff were in attendance in their usual workplaces. This was due to the essential nature of the work that my Department carries out, for instance, in meat plants, at ports, in laboratories and on farms. </p>  <p>  In line with Government advice, my Department implemented a return-to-the-workplace schedule in February of this year and since March, staff who previously worked remotely have been attending the workplace on at least three days per week. Prior to the pandemic, full-time working from home arrangements were rare and, typically, cases related to health matters and were as a result of advice from the Chief Medical Officer (CMO). </p>  <p>  As required under the Blended Working Policy Framework for Civil Service Organisations my Department is preparing to launch its own Blended Working Policy which will enable staff to formally apply to work remotely for some of their working week.</p></reply>
