In order to qualify for the Scheme, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate, a PMC, issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) in the HSE. Assessments for the primary medical certificate, by the HSE, are continuing to take place. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p><p>In the event that a PMC is not granted by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer an appeal may be made to the independent Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal (DDMBA) who operate out of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire.</p><p>I have no role in relation to the granting or refusal of PMCs and the HSE and the Medical Board of Appeal must be independent in their clinical determinations.</p><p>As of 31<sup>st</sup>December 2021, there are 382 people awaiting an appeal hearing with the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.</p><p>All members of the DDMBA have resigned. My officials engaged with the Department of Health and the Public Appointments Service to seek expressions of interest from medical practitioners to participate in the Board. I am informed that the formal notice seeking expressions of interest have been issued. It is hoped to move this process along as quickly as possible so that appeals can recommence as soon as possible. </p><p>Requests for appeal hearings can be sent to the DDMBA secretary based in the National Rehabilitation Hospital. New appeal hearing dates will be issued once the new Board is in place.</p></reply>

A strategy on Retail Payments</p><p>2. A legislative proposal on a market in crypto-assets. This is known as the MICA regulation</p><p>3. A legislative proposal on digital and operational resilience. This is known as the DORA regulation</p><p>4. A legislative proposal on a pilot regime for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology. This is known as the DLT pilot.</p><p>On 24 November last year, the European Parliament announced that it had reached agreement with the Council on the DLT pilot scheme. So this is already in place.</p><p>The second element of the package, the MICA regulation proposal, is still under review by the European Parliament. The Council reached general agreement on this proposal under the Slovenian presidency in November of last year. The expectation is that trilogues would commence under the current French presidency. </p><p>All EU finance ministers agree to the utmost need to collaborate and approach regulation of cryptoassets in a joint, cohesive and holistic manner, in order to protect monetary sovereignty and preserve financial stability.</p><p>This sentiment is further supported by the G20 and G7 members.</p><p>My Department continues to work closely with our partners in the European Union, and globally, to ensure that the appropriate regulation recognises the risks presented by crypto assets.</p></reply>

Ireland applies the 23%, 13.5% and 9% VAT rates in this context.</p><p>The standard rate of 23% applies to approximately 51% of activity, including cars, petrol, diesel, alcohol, tobacco, electrical equipment and CD/DVDs.</p><p>The reduced rate of 13.5% applies to approximately 28% of activity, including fuel used for heat or light, construction, housing, labour intensive services and general repairs and maintenance. </p><p>The reduced rate of 9% applies to about 10% of activity, including holiday accommodation, restaurants, digital and print newspapers and periodicals, and sporting facilities.  </p><p>A zero rate accounts for a little over 11% of activity, including to most food, books, children&rsquo;s clothes and shoes, and oral medicines.</p><p>In addition a super-reduced rate of 4.8% applies to livestock registered by farmers while some activity is entirely exempt from VAT, including transport, water, education, financial services, schools and hospitals, services provided by charities, etc. </p><p>VAT receipts for 2022 were projected at &euro;16,895 million in Budget 2022. This was slightly above the White Paper projection of &euro;16,770 million. My Department will update the forecast for taxation revenues in the Stability Programme Update, to be published in April 2022.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-22a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022200054#WRA02400"><p>I am advised by Revenue that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. The VAT Directive obliges each Member State to have a standard rate of VAT and also allows that a Member State may choose to have no more than two reduced rates of VAT, which may be no less than 5%, and which may be applied to certain goods and services:  any of those listed in Annex III of the Directive. Within this framework, Ireland currently applies a standard rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Article 102 of the VAT Directive provides that, after consultation with the EU VAT Committee, a Member State may choose to apply a reduced rate to the supply of natural gas, electricity, or district heating.  The Commission recently indicated that this provision could be used by Member States without the requirement to consult the VAT Committee in advance.</p><p>  The Article 102 provision is not transposed into Irish legislation because Ireland, in line with the VAT Directive and by way of special derogation from the general rule, maintains several &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; provisions and derogations that allow us to maintain reduced rates to certain supplies for historical reasons. It is on this basis that Ireland applies its 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to the supply of fuel, gas, oil, and electricity services for both domestic and commercial use. The current 13.5% VAT rate applied to energy products is a &lsquo;parked rate&rsquo;, governed by Article 118 of the VAT Directive and standstill provisions from 1991 and cannot be reduced below 12%.</p><p>  In the event that Ireland chose to apply a reduced rate to the limited items covered by Article 102, those items could no longer rely on our derogation and those items would have to be returned to the standard rate of VAT in the future.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-22a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022200054#WRA02700"><p>I am assured by Revenue that combating the threat which fuel fraud and the illicit alcohol and tobacco trades pose to legitimate businesses, consumers and the Exchequer continues to be a priority. </p>  <p>  Steps taken by Revenue to combat the illegal mineral oils trade include the introduction of stringent supply chain controls and reporting requirements, a rigorous programme of risk focused enforcement action and the application of robust legislation. In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation in April 2015. The industry view is that the actions taken have been successful in curtailing fuel fraud. </p>  <p>  Illicit trade in alcohol can occur through the diversion of untaxed alcohol onto the market, through the production of counterfeit alcohol and through smuggling from countries with lower taxes. I am aware that Revenue takes appropriate action where illicit activity is detected and that this action is informed by intelligence on criminal activity and risk-based examination of commercial traffic and stock in retail premises. </p>  <p>  In relation to the tobacco trade, I am advised that Revenue uses a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence, and risk-based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages to intercept illicit products. Action after importation includes checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. </p>  <p>  I am aware that Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against fuel, alcohol and tobacco crime, and also cooperate closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, in the framework of the Cross-Border Joint Agency Task Force. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups who operate across both jurisdictions and are responsible for much of this criminality. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Revenue&rsquo;s work against fuel fraud and the illicit alcohol and tobacco trades has achieved a considerable level of success. I know that Revenue is very conscious of the resourcefulness of those involved and remains vigilant for, and ready to respond to, any new developments in these areas.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-22a.33.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022200054#WRA03200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 31 together.</p><p>The National Claims Information Database (NCID) was established in order to improve transparency in the insurance claims environment and to support data-driven policy making. It contains a wealth of information, including data on: the cost of premiums; the cost and frequency of claims; claims settlement; and the revenues, expenditures, and profitability of firms. Having initially focussed on the private motor insurance sector, under the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>the scope of the NCID was expanded to facilitate the collection of data on employers&rsquo; liability and public liability insurance claims, with the first such report being published last July.</p><p>These NCID reports provide a valuable insight into the key insurance markets for consumers and businesses, which is vital to further developing our understanding of how claims costs impact premiums. This should enable us to better-tailor reforms to the insurance sector. For example, the recently-published General Scheme of a Bill to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, which aims to increase the number of cases settled through the Board, points to NCID data which shows that claims settled by the Board are settled more quickly, and attract much lower legal costs, than those that proceed to litigation. </p><p>In addition, the NCID will allow for an assessment of the impact of the many reforms already undertaken in the insurance sector. For example, I understand from the Central Bank of Ireland that the Private Motor Report to be published in 2022 will provide initial data on the newly introduced Personal Injuries Guidelines. The NCID is also continually looking to improve the transparency and insight that can be provided through these reports, and each edition has been amended to include more information. </p><p>With regard to more frequent reporting, I understand that the Central Bank of Ireland is also looking at the merits and feasibility of collecting the information contained in certain sections of the Motor NCID Report more frequently, where this would provide additional insight. For this reason, the Bank initially plans to publish supplementary information on motor premiums on a semi-annual basis. The merits and feasibility of providing any further information on a more frequent basis will be assessed in the future. To conclude, I welcome the information already provided by the NCID, and believe it will remain an excellent tool to ensure transparency in the insurance market into the future.</p></reply>

Consequently, I am precluded from giving any direction or instruction to Revenue in regard to the review of any threshold relating to e-working.</p>  <p>  However, Revenue advises me that there are currently no plans to increase the &euro;3.20 allowance. The value of relief allowed under the administrative arrangements is already considered sufficient to cover any legitimate additional costs incurred by workers.  The level of support allowed also compares favourably internationally. </p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, in the Finance Act 2021, I enhanced and formalised the tax arrangements for working from home in line with Government policy to facilitate and support remote working.  Accordingly, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heat and broadband in respect of those days spent working from home can be claimed by taxpayers. </p>  <p>  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate. This measure will provide some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home. </p>  <p>  While I have no immediate plans to increase the tax relief for working from home, I would point out that the Government recently announced a &euro;505 million package of measures to mitigate the cost of living, including a once-off energy credit of &euro;200 including VAT. These measures will support all payers of domestic electricity bills to help to off-set rising prices.     This is a measure that will benefit all households regardless of whether they have an income tax liability or not. </p></reply>

As is the norm, this will include inflation projections for the next few years.  The projections will cover headline and core inflation and, in line with standard domestic and international practice, are not disaggregated by income group or household type. </p><p>I am conscious of the acceleration in consumer price inflation over the past six months or so, with similar trends seen across advanced economies.  Several factors are behind this, including higher energy prices and global supply chain disruptions.  On the domestic front, the strength and speed of the economic recovery has led to a mismatch between demand and supply, including in the labour market where I note CSO figures published last week showing the highest ever level of employment in our country. </p><p>The rate of inflation is expected to ease over the course of this year as temporary factors fade, demand eases and supply catches up.  </p><p>Nevertheless, the Government is very conscious of the cost of living pressures facing households and, accordingly, introduced a number of measures in <i>Budget 2022</i>covering a range of costs to people; including health, income supports, family and child costs, energy, education and housing costs. </p><p>In December, the Cabinet also approved an energy credit of &euro;100 to be made this year to an estimated 2.1m domestic electricity account holders. </p><p>The Government announced another &euro;290 million package on February 10<sup>th</sup>to further assist households, bringing the overall package including the aforementioned energy credit, to &euro;505 million. The measures include an increase in the energy credit to &euro;200 per household including VAT and an additional one-off payment of &euro;125 for all those in receipt of the fuel allowance in March. The <i>Drugs Payment Scheme</i>contribution threshold will be reduced to &euro;80 per month, while the &euro;10 increase to the weekly income threshold of the <i>Working Family Payment</i>will be brought forward to April from June. Public transport fares will be reduced from April until the end of the year, while school transport family caps will be reduced<b></b>at both primary and post-primary level. </p><p>In summary, the Government&rsquo;s response has been timely and forceful and will help to alleviate cost pressures for households, in particular those on low incomes.</p></reply>

From a tax perspective, this relates to income tax, Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) (including Employer&rsquo;s PRSI) collected through the PAYE system. The implication for the individuals is that they do not have the benefit of certain employment related entitlements such as rates of pay, holiday pay, sick pay and certain social welfare benefits. </p><p>  It must be borne in mind that a worker&rsquo;s employment status is not a matter of choice; it depends on the terms and conditions of the job. While it is usually clear whether an individual is employed through a &lsquo;contract of service&rsquo; or self-employed through a &ldquo;contract for service&rdquo;, it is not always obvious. The question of employment versus self-employment status arises in three different areas: tax where it is determined by Revenue, Social Welfare where it is determined by the Department of Social Protection, and employment rights where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) makes the determination.</p><p>A revised Code of Practice on Determining Employment Status was published by the Minister for Social Protection in July 2021. The purpose of the Code is to provide an enhanced understanding of employment status, taking into account current labour market practices and developments in legislation and case law. These developments include, for example, new forms of work such as platform work and the gig economy. It is a &lsquo;living document&rsquo;, which will continue to be updated to reflect relevant changes into the future. </p><p>  During the four years 2018 &ndash; 2021, Revenue staff, either on a standalone or joint-agency basis, visited 3,786 construction sites interviewing 14,968 contractors, sub-contractors, and employees at their site to make them aware of their compliance and other statutory obligations. As a result of these activities, 864 individuals were registered as new employees for PAYE and an additional 360 sub-contractors were reclassified as employees. In addition to construction site visits, Revenue staff carried out a further 8,232 visits across a range of businesses in connection with normal shadow economy activity or compliance activity relating to Covid-19 support schemes. </p><p>Revenue applies a data-driven, risk-based approach to compliance interventions, utilising the information provided by all principal contractors on relevant contracts and payments to subcontractors to refine their risk focus.  This applies to both private and publicly funded projects. </p><p>  In addition to its compliance activity, Revenue provides customer service support to public bodies, assisting those bodies with voluntary compliance, so that the public bodies can be satisfied that they apply the correct treatment under the Code of Practice on Determining Employment Status.  </p><p>  Lastly, Revenue officials regularly meet with counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Social Protection and the WRC to discuss matters of mutual interest relating to employment/self-employment and recent focus has been on consideration of improvements that could be made in dealing with bogus self-employment.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that the EU Commission has recently published a draft Directive that is aimed at providing significant new rights to &quot;platform workers&quot; across all Member States. </p></reply>

Finance Act 2016 extended the levy to 2021. The annual yield of this levy has been approximately &euro;150 million. </p><p>In advance of Budget 2022, and in light of the then pending lapse of the Levy, I took a decision to extend it for another year and to apply it only to those banks that will continue to operate in the Irish market going forward.

My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for Financial Services, Credit Unions and Insurance, Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming, published Action Plan 2022 on 3 February 2022.</p><p>One of the five themes Minister Fleming has identified for Action Plan 2022 is &lsquo;Regionalisation and promotion&rsquo;. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland hold pivotal roles in delivering the regional policy commitments in the <i>Ireland for Finance</i>strategy. Currently, employment is at the highest level it has ever been in the international financial services sector, with over 30 per cent of these jobs located in the areas outside Dublin. Although it is the business owners and investors who are the final decision makers on where to establish operations, the State&rsquo;s enterprise agencies provide information, financial supports, and some of the physical infrastructure to enable and encourage balanced regional development. IDA Ireland is focused principally on promoting regional locations in Ireland to investors in international markets, and Enterprise Ireland provides a range of developmental supports to regionally based Irish owned companies in the sector, at all stages of development, who are looking to grow in international markets. Both enterprise agencies also provide valuable inputs to the development of policies and programmes by other state bodies in areas such as planning and education to ensure that policy on regional development is coordinated and well informed. </p><p>I would highlight to the Deputy that regional development is at the centre of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy &lsquo;Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021&ndash;2024&rsquo;, which will target half of all investments for regional locations. As such, IDA Ireland is committed to the pursuit of more balanced, compact regional development, which can deliver complimentary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development. Underpinning this strategy, IDA Ireland will target potential investment that advances regional development, as follows:</p><p>(a) win investment that drives recovery and supports development in regional locations,</p><p>(b) partner with existing regional clients to transform through innovation and upskilling,</p><p>(c) seek to support transformation, spill overs, and linkages through cluster initiatives,</p><p>(d) collaborate with clients and stakeholder to facilitate remote working opportunities, and</p><p>(e) Continue to roll-out a regional property programme essential to regional delivery of investments.</p><p>During 2021, IDA Growth in Regions was particularly strong with 53% or 133 projects of the 249 investments won going to regional locations. Employment growth was recorded in every region of the country.  IDA continues to prioritise regional locations for the IFS sector and has won a number of significant regional investments since 2020 across the sub-sectors of Fund Servicing, Insurance, Fintech and Payments. The increase in remote and hybrid working is increasing access for IDA clients to a broader national talent pool and this presents an opportunity for further regional development. </p><p>Strengthening regional enterprise development also remains a key focus for Enterprise Ireland as part of its new strategy for 2022 to 2024. Its responses will reflect the varying needs and opportunities of enterprise at all stages of development, across different regions including financial services and fintech. This will encompass working directly with new and existing companies throughout the regions, supporting increased enterprise collaboration, and working in collaboration with regional stakeholders. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s supports are integrated with a national network of nine regional offices in Ireland and over 30 Enterprise Ireland offices in international locations that facilitate access to more than 60 countries.</p><p>At the launch of the Ireland for Finance Action Plan for 2022, Minister of State Fleming announced that the Department of Finance will be carrying out a mid-term update of the strategy to maintain the growth of the international financial services sector. The review will run alongside the implementation of the 2022 Action Plan, will inform the prioritisation of work and strategic direction in the future while building on the success achieved to date.</p></reply>

The information gained from these meetings will help inform the next steps taken by Government. </p><p>In terms of supporting the sector to provide essential financial services to local communities, the following are some recent developments which highlight the potential of the sector to grow and fulfil a role in relation to community banking. </p><p><b>Lending and Investment</b></p><p>  The Central Bank has in recent years reviewed both the lending and investment frameworks. Since 1 January 2020, credit unions now have a combined capacity to provide up to &euro;1.1 billion in additional SME and mortgage loans, with further capacity available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank. As of September 2021, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;387 million, an increase of 19% year-on-year.  </p><p>  Credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). I am pleased to share with the Deputy that three credit union backed funds have received approval from the Central Bank. Credit unions will be able to invest up to &euro;900 million in these regulated funds, which will subsequently lend to AHBs. </p><p><b>SME Lending </b></p><p>  Nineteen credit unions were approved in early 2021 for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Further, in November five credit unions were announced as participants in the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme (BILS). The BILS provides low-cost loans of &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m to eligible Brexit-impacted businesses.</p><p>  In total, SME lending has grown 6.9% year on year to end September 2021. Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book.</p><p><b>Access to Finance for Retrofit </b></p><p>  The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit. My officials have been engaging with stakeholders to support increased credit union participation in retrofit loan schemes. </p><p><b>Other Services</b></p><p>  Other than member savings and lending, in order to provide &ldquo;additional services&rdquo;, a credit union must receive approval from the Central Bank. </p><p>66 credit unions are approved to provide current accounts. </p><p>  The Central Bank has prescribed a list of exempt services which may be provided without requiring approval. The Central Bank is undertaking a review of the Exempt Services Schedule to ensure that the services listed reflect the current financial services landscape.

Its primary purpose was to widen the tax base and to provide a steady income to the Exchequer to provide funding for public services. The USC is an individualised tax, meaning that a person&rsquo;s liability to the tax is determined on the basis of a persons own individual income and personal circumstances. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.</p>  <p>  The USC has played a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer, and USC receipts have been central to the current stability of the public finances since March 2020, despite the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  Receipts from the USC in 2021 amounted to &euro;4.4 billion &ndash; 16.5% of total income tax receipts or 6.4% of total Exchequer receipts. The projected USC yield for 2022 is broadly similar. </p>  <p>  If USC were to be abolished, it would be necessary to raise approximately &euro;4.4 billion from other sources. The Deputy suggests replacing the USC with a high income social charge but the Deputy has not specified an appropriate level/rate for this charge or what income level would be considered a high income.</p>  <p>  In any event, such a proposal would significantly narrow the income tax base and would expose our economy to significant risks in the event of a future economic downturn. Currently, it is estimated that 29.5% of taxpayer units have incomes greater than &euro;50,000 and will pay 86.4% of the total income tax and USC for 2022. Furthermore, 8.3% of taxpayer units have incomes greater than &euro;100,000 and will pay 55.5% of the total income tax and USC in 2022. A high income social charge could increase the marginal tax rate, which could create a clear disincentive to work and impact on the competitiveness of our tax code.</p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the world, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution. Our redistributive tax system has been acknowledged by the IMF, the OECD and the ESRI. It is my view a broad-based, progressive income tax system, where the majority of income earners make some contribution but according to their means, is the most fair and sustainable income tax system in the long term.</p>  <p>   As such, I have no plans to abolish the USC and replace it with a high income social charge.</p></reply>

In this regard, under the Action Plan, my Department was tasked with examining the Central Bank&rsquo;s <i>Review of Differential Pricing in the Motor and Home Insurance Markets</i>and taking any appropriate actions as deemed necessary in light of the Bank&rsquo;s final report.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank published its final report, along with a public consultation on proposals to strengthen the consumer protection framework in July 2021. Among the Bank&rsquo;s proposals is a ban on &ldquo;price walking&rdquo; in the motor and home insurance markets for personal consumers. Price walking is a form of differential pricing whereby consumers are charged higher premiums, relative to the expected cost, the longer they remain with an insurance provider. As such, it represents a <i>de facto</i>&ldquo;loyalty penalty&rdquo; on long-serving customers, with the Bank&rsquo;s findings showing that the premiums paid by certain policyholders deviate significantly from the expected costs to the insurer.</p><p>I therefore welcome the proposal to ban this practice, as I believe it will protect those customers who prefer to stay with their current insurer from being unfairly penalised for doing so in terms of the premium paid. As set out in its final report, I understand that the Bank&rsquo;s intention is to apply this ban on price walking from the point of second renewal, meaning that consumers who wish to switch provider would still be able to benefit from discounts for new business customers. As such, I believe it represents a balanced approach that is well-calibrated to the Irish market and the preference of consumers here. </p><p>In summary, I believe that the proposed ban on price walking is a very significant development which would ensure fairness and further strengthen protections for consumers in the motor and home insurance markets. In order to ensure that this is the case, my Department is currently advancing legislation which would require the Bank to report on the impact of this ban, or any other measures taken to target price walking, within 18 months of the measure coming into effect. This would provide timely oversight, thereby allowing the Government to act swiftly if further intervention is needed in order to protect consumers from any unfair loyalty penalty.</p></reply>

It would also narrow the tax base by exempting approximately 39% of taxpayer units from the charge. </p><p>I would note that in recent Budgets, including Budget 2022, this Government actively increased the USC ceiling for the 2% rate in line with increases to the national minimum wage, to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate would remain outside the top rates of USC.</p><p>Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the world, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution.

This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued. The view of the independent Commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation. Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would very likely be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the cost pressure on tenants.</p>  <p>  At the time of its abolition, the rental tax relief cost the Exchequer up to &euro;97m per annum, and it is likely that this figure would be even higher today were a similar scheme to be put in place. The refundable element mentioned by the Deputy would potentially add further to the cost.</p>  <p>  Proposals for new tax incentive measures are assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p>  <p>  Having regard to these considerations, the case for introducing a refundable tax credit as outlined by the Deputy is not a strong one from my Department's perspective. </p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, the 'Housing for All' strategy is intended to deliver more homes of all types for people with different housing needs, including those who wish to rent at an affordable price. The strategy which was published by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage sets out a number of specific initiatives in relation to the rental market.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.</p><p>In relation to Deputy O'Sullivan's question, an increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current housing crisis. The HTB scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. A move to introduce a similar scheme for second-hand properties would not achieve this aim; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect required in terms of encouraging additional supply of new properties. In passing, I might note that the number of housing commencements for 2021 at over 30,700, and up from 21,686 in 2020, is very encouraging. As the Deputies may be aware, the Housing for All Strategy has as a target the construction of an average of at least 33,000 new homes per year out to 2030.</p><p>With regard to the suggestion by Deputy Flaherty that the HTB scheme be extended to second-hand properties in Longford, I refer to my point above regarding the intended incentive effect of the scheme to increase overall supply by encouraging new builds. Furthermore, it would not be possible or equitable for me to amend the scheme in favour of any particular county or region. </p><p>As the Deputies will appreciate, decisions regarding taxation measures are usually made in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process. Such decisions must have regard to the sound management of the public finances and my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. The guidelines make clear that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures, where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p><p>In relation to Deputy Smyth's question, matters regarding housing initiatives are, in the first instance, a matter for the Minister for Housing. However, I can confirm that the only tax-based scheme relevant in this case is HTB and it is restricted to First-Time Buyers. Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 requires that applicants for the scheme must be first-time buyers. This includes circumstances where there is more than one person involved in the purchase or building of a new home. The definition of first time buyer under HTB is as follows:</p><p>&quot;  <i>first-time purchaser' means an individual who, at the time of a claim under subsection (3) has not, either individually or jointly with any other person, previously purchased or previously built, directly or indirectly, on his or her own behalf a dwelling; &quot;</i></p><p>The intention is to target the HTB scheme on those who have not had the opportunity to build up equity in another property which could be used to purchase the second or subsequent property.</p><p>Finally, and as the Deputies may be aware, I announced in my Budget 2022 address that a formal review of the scheme will take place in 2022. The review will be fundamental in nature and will inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022. Issues related to the terms of reference and a specific timeline for completion as well as the question of who will carry out the review are being considered by my Department at present and the matter is expected to be moved forward shortly.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Sub-Group is pursuing 66 cross-departmental actions, as set out in the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>, including a number of key measures that should help to improve costs for motorists. </p><p>Chief among these was the delivery, last year, of new Personal Injuries Guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum, which should provide  greater certainty regarding award levels. The Guidelines have significantly reduced awards for many common injuries, and should also help to lower legal fees by encouraging greater use of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) in settling claims. As a result, consistent implementation of the Guidelines should reduce the cost of claims, in turn leading to lower premiums. </p><p>Another key development with respect to motor insurance is the proposal by the Central Bank, following its extensive review of differential pricing, to ban the practice of &ldquo;price walking&rdquo; in the motor and home insurance markets for personal consumers from July this year. This is a very significant move, as it would end the &ldquo;loyalty penalty&rdquo;, whereby motorists and other consumers are charged higher premiums, relative to the expected cost, the longer they remain with an insurance provider. </p><p>According to the latest CSO Consumer Price Index data for January 2022, the price of motor insurance is now 11% lower than in June 2020, when this Government was formed, and has fallen by about 10% since the Insurance Reform Sub-Group was established in September 2020. This reflects a downward trend seen in recent years, with motor insurance prices having decreased by 38% from their peak level in mid-2016. At a time of other inflationary pressures in the economy, I believe this significant decline in prices indicates that past reforms by the Cost of Insurance Working Group, as well as the more recent achievements under the Action Plan, are contributing to positive developments in motor premiums. </p><p>Minister Fleming and I, along with officials, will continue to work with colleagues to complete the outstanding reforms under the Action Plan, with a view to improving the affordability of insurance for all groups. For example, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has recently published legislative proposals to enhance the role of the PIAB, which should bolster the advantages accruing from the Personal Injuries Guidelines, and further help to reduce the overall cost of claims. Both Minister of State Fleming and I remain committed to holding the industry to account so as to ensure that the benefits of this series of reform measures are reflected in the price of insurance, including for motorists.</p></reply>

In this regard, the Government has introduced a detailed plan for housing &ndash; Housing for All &ndash; which is intended to deliver more homes of all types for people with different housing needs and this government has allocated a record amount of funding under this strategy. </p><p>However, it is important to note that, taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost overall housing supply. In line with the Department of Finance's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, consideration of whether a tax measure is the most appropriate policy tool for a given purpose is required and the presumption should be that non-tax measures should be considered before the use of a tax&ndash;based measure. I would wish to avoid any tax expenditures that could distort the market, particularly where it is not clear that they would in this instance result in additional supply or reduced prices for first time buyers. Therefore I do not propose to introduce additional capital tax reliefs for gains from property sales.</p><p>In respect of stamp duty, as it is the buyer who is liable for payment of it, not the seller, if I were to provide any form of exemption/relief from it for a subset of properties or property buyers it would represent an unfair advantage to the sellers and/or buyers of such properties over those selling/buying properties that would not qualify. It is also very likely that any benefit that such a measure might generate for a subset of sellers/buyers would be quickly swallowed up by increased asking/offer prices, as the volume of such properties is unlikely to be sufficient to deflect market trends to any notable degree. Such a measure would also likely feed demand and compound what is already a significant supply side problem.</p><p>The Deputy should also note that a significant motivation for introducing the 10% stamp duty charge on the multiple purchase of houses is to dis-incentivise such purchases by institutional investors with a view to levelling the playing field for first time buyers and others interested in buying a home to live in. This measure should help improve the supply of houses available to first time buyers. </p><p>Finally, I would also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the particular actions within the Housing for All plan that specifically target first time buyers:</p><p>- a supply of an unprecedented 4,000 affordable purchase homes, on average, every year for families, couples and single people</p><p>- a new local authority-led &lsquo;Affordable Purchase Scheme&rsquo;</p><p>- a new &lsquo;First Home&rsquo; shared equity scheme for buyers of new build homes in private homes</p><p>- a reformed &lsquo;Local Authority Home Loan&rsquo; scheme</p><p>- an &lsquo;Owner Occupier Guarantee&rsquo;, to secure homes for first-time buyers and other owner-occupiers</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the following medical criteria, in order to obtain a Primary Medical Certificate:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The current medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer. Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.</p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken. In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities. Its work was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  This is the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions/mobility supports for those with a disability.</p>  <p>  The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, held its first meeting on the 26th January 2022. My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

Its primary purpose was to widen the tax base and to provide a steady income to the Exchequer to provide funding for public services.</p>  <p>  Both income tax and the USC are taxes on income, however they are structurally different with some material differences between the two in relation to each system&rsquo;s income base, range of reliefs available and the manner of assessment.</p>  <p>  Income tax applies to all sources of income earned by an individual, as calculated in accordance with provisions of the Income Tax Acts. Income tax also applies to certain income of trusts and non-Irish resident companies. An individual&rsquo;s entitlement to tax credits and their standard rate cut off point is determined based on his or her personal circumstances. </p>  <p>  The income tax system provides for a wide range of tax credits, deductions and exemptions which may be used to reduce either the amount of income on which an individual is taxable, or the individual&rsquo;s ultimate income tax liability. Eligibility for these reliefs is subject to the individual meeting the relevant conditions attached to each measure.</p>  <p>  Within the income tax system, married couples or civil partners, may be able to transfer tax credits, tax bands and reliefs from one partner to the other. Whereas the USC is an individualised tax, meaning that a person&rsquo;s liability to the tax is determined on the basis of his/her own individual income and personal circumstances. </p>  <p>  Similar to income tax, there are different rates of USC and cut off points, however the rates and cut off points differ to that of the income tax regime. </p>  <p>  The USC system incorporates different rates applicable to different levels of income and different sources of income.  It should also be noted that some expenditure that qualifies for relief from an income tax perspective, may not qualify for relief from a USC perspective. Such expenditure includes payments into a pension scheme and permanent health benefit contributions. Further to this, all Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments and similar type payments made under the Social Welfare Acts are exempt from USC, while some DSP payments are not exempt from income tax.</p>  <p>  An amalgamation of income tax and USC into one tax would require fundamental changes to the structure of the personal income tax system and may have consequential impacts on Exchequer receipts and would likely present a number of considerable challenges in relation to the systems underpinning both income tax and USC. </p>  <p>  In 2016, joint Department of Finance/Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) research found that USC represented a more stable form of revenue than income tax. The findings highlighted that USC revenues would fluctuate by less than income tax revenues whenever income is volatile, for example where the economy moves from a boom into a bust. Given the openness of the Irish economy and consequent susceptibility to economic shocks, the contribution that the USC makes to the stability of the State&rsquo;s revenue sources is considerable.</p>  <p>  On the face it, a single unified system of personal income tax may appear to offer advantages as compared with current arrangements.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, work was carried out on examining the possibility of an amalgamation of USC and PRSI. Many of the significant challenges outlined in &ldquo;The Report of the Working Group on the Amalgamation of USC and PRSI&rdquo;, published in September 2018, remain valid in the context of an amalgamation of USC and Income Tax. The Report can be located here &ndash;</p>  <p>  assets.gov.ie/180893/1c9cd219-fb8a-47d2-86c3-d1cd9c3bcf03.pdf </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to carry out any further analysis on the proposal suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for KEEP, an option must be exercised within 10 years of grant. The gain will however be subject to Capital Gains Tax on subsequent disposal of the shares. This can result in a saving for scheme participants; this is the point of the scheme and notwithstanding the information about the proposed review below, there are no plans to fundamentally alter this aspect. </p>  <p>  The cost to the Exchequer of KEEP for the year 2019 was &euro;78,000 and for the year 2020 it was &euro;186,000. As no exercise of share options occurred during the years 2017 and 2018, there was no cost to the Exchequer in terms of income tax, USC and PRSI for those years. Details of the cost to the Exchequer for 2021 will only be available once the employer returns for that year have been received and processed.

The most recent data for modified domestic demand &ndash; the best measure of domestic economic activity &ndash; showed continued growth, with domestic activity surpassing its pre-pandemic level. Whilst the domestic economy is rapidly bouncing back, external trade has bolstered the Irish economy throughout the crisis.</p>  <p>  The exports of the multinational sector in Ireland proved highly resilient during the pandemic, and MNCs supported the Irish economy via employment and taxes. Importantly this growth is now becoming more broadly balanced with the indigenous traded sector rebounding strongly last year.  </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the contribution Ireland&rsquo;s exports make to the economy, and the need to maintain our competitive advantage on the international stage. The Irish modified current account, which strips out the distorting effects of globalisation, is also in a very strong position and is expected to remain in surplus over the medium term. </p>  <p>  The strong recovery in the economy has helped drive the recovery in the labour market, with 2.5 million now in employment and the Covid-19 adjusted unemployment rate falling from a peak of 31.5 per cent in April 2020 to 7.8 per cent in January 2022.    </p>  <p>  Against this positive economic backdrop we cannot become complacent and we must remain cognisant of the challenges to our competitiveness both now and into the future. As the economy approaches full employment, wage pressures are likely to emerge which could in turn feed through to persistent inflationary pressure. Indeed, shortages are already emerging in certain sectors.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future, the international outlook remains a source of continued uncertainty and I am acutely aware of the risks this poses. There is expected to be a negative implication for Irish trade once the UK fully implements the trade provisions of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The Government continues to engage with the EU and the UK to minimise the disruption created by Brexit, and a great deal has been done to ensure Irish businesses are adequately prepared for its still unfolding effects.   </p>  <p>  Beyond Brexit, Ireland, as a small open economy, remains particularly exposed to global risks, including the worsening epidemiological situation, persistent supply side bottlenecks, energy price shocks, global inflationary pressure and rising geopolitical tension. My Department will continue to monitor the risks to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness closely, and this Government will respond to them as required to protect and promote the Irish economy.  </p></reply>

This is because farming, which is defined in section 654 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, requires the occupation of farmland. Agricultural contracting does not involve the occupation of farmland. The measure is specifically targeted at the farming sector to address the particular problems faced by family farms.   </p>  <p>  My officials met with contractors' representatives in December 2019 and advised that my Department was intending to schedule a review of the scheme (and related aspects) in the context of a wider report on agri-tax reliefs and the Government's Climate policy. I have since received further correspondence from those representatives, most recently on 15 February last.</p>  <p>  The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in the intervening period caused the review to be deferred and it has yet to take place. In the meantime, the status quo has remained in relation to the application and scope of section 664A. As I advised the Deputy in December last, my Department intends to carry out the review, most likely in the first half of 2022. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, currently, those who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of their trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for these expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel. </p>  <p>  Finally, and as the Deputy will appreciate, decisions regarding taxation measures are made as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process at the appropriate time and having regard to the sound management of the public finances and my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. Furthermore, I must also have regard to ensuring that any tax measures are consistent with the need to meet our Climate Action Plan targets.</p></reply>

However, against this it should also be noted that some new lenders have entered the market and are playing a greater role in the provision of new services. More generally, it is likely that increased competition in the provision of financial services globally will take place and that this will have an influence in Ireland with potential new entrants to the deposit-taking, credit and payments markets for households and businesses. </p>  <p>  The European Union&rsquo;s initiatives in the context of the Capital Markets Union, which aim to improve the provision of financial services across borders within the Union, also have the potential to further improve levels of choice regarding savings and investments for consumers, and to improve access to finance for businesses in the Irish economy. Further, the scope for provision of services within the Union will be enhanced by the adoption of digital financial technologies already underway.</p>  <p>  Even in a concentrated banking system such as that in place in recent years, price competition is possible, particularly in a growing economy. Trends show that interest rates in Ireland have been falling in recent years, providing benefit to consumers. Interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.69% in December 2021. SME and consumer loans interest rates have also declined over the same period.</p>  <p>  However, I fully appreciate that enhanced sustainable competition in the credit and banking market more generally will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers. Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will assess various aspects of the banking market and will consider options to encourage greater competition in the credit and banking market, including possible options to develop the mortgage market. </p></reply>

However, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders. As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.   </p>  <p>  Despite this, it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland. For example, the interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.69% in December 2021.   </p>  <p>  The weighted average interest rate on new fixed rate mortgage agreements stood at 2.59% in December 2021, down from a series high of 4.11% in December 2014. There has also been a reduction in the interest rates charged on loans to SMEs and consumers over the same period.</p>  <p>  However, Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include for example operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience; </p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks); and</p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income ratios which has been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years </p>  <p>  Separately the Central Bank introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase. </p>  <p>  The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's (CCPC) mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. Consumers can reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible. Indeed a Central Bank study estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term. </p>  <p>  To conclude I appreciate that greater sustainable competition in the credit market will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers.  Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will consider how the banking system can best support economic activity, assess competition and consumer choice in the market for banking services and consider options to further develop the mortgage market.  </p></reply>

This 23% APR cap will also apply to hire-purchase agreements.  </p>  <p>  Both these Bills, together with the existing interest rate cap on credit union credit, anticipate a draft provision in the European Commission's proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer credits, which was published last June.

While the overall venture capital sector in Ireland is strong and continues to grow, there is a trend towards growth being driven by larger, later stage deals and investments. The Irish market is producing ambitious founders with strong technical expertise and a drive to innovate in much greater numbers, so the need to nurture seed and scaling activities in Ireland remains very important.</p>  <p>  The &euro;90m fund programme is made up of a &euro;30m investment from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment (DETE), through Enterprise Ireland (EI), which is matched by a &euro;30m investment from the European Investment Fund (EIF). The &euro;60m fund will be managed by EIF and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) will co-invest a further &euro;30m alongside on a deal by deal basis. Establishment of the fund programme enhances the growing relationship between Enterprise Ireland, the EIF and ISIF. The &euro;90m fund programme will attract both new fund managers and new private investors and will crowd-in significant private investment.</p>  <p>  The fund programme will operate as a &ldquo;fund of funds&rdquo;, essentially a fund that invests in specialist fund managers, who then source companies with strong potential for a commercial return on investment. Ireland is lacking in this type of fund, so an additional benefit of this project is that the Irish equity investment ecosystem is further developed and matured.</p>  <p>  All investments are expected to be made within a three-year timeframe. The investments are forecast to have a 10-year life. Investments will be targeted and prioritised in areas that have experienced difficulty in attracting investment, such as funds that invest in companies with a focus on regional development, climate change and female entrepreneurship.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that our most innovative, early stage firms have been affected by the more cautious investment environment which followed the uncertainty of a pandemic. SMEs make up over 99% of our firms and employ over one million people across our cities, towns and villages. They are the lifeblood of our economy and we will continue to depend on their innovations and successes to secure the future, sustained economic growth of our country.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may be aware, the Programme for Government states that &ldquo;from Budget 2022 onwards, in the event that incomes are again rising as the economy recovers, credits and bands will be index linked to earnings. This will be done to prevent an increase in the real burden of income tax, to prevent more low income workers being taken into the tax net, and to ensure there is no increase in the number of people having to pay higher income tax and Universal Social Charge rates&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>   Budget 2022 included an income tax package amounting to &euro;520 million, which, within available resources, sought to index the income tax standard rate bands and main personal tax credits. The single income tax rate band was increased by 4.2 per cent from &euro;35,300 to &euro;36,800 for the 2022 tax year, with commensurate increases for persons who are married/in civil partnerships.  The main tax credits, personal tax credits, employee tax credit and earned income credit, were also increased by just over 3 per cent from &euro;1,650 to &euro;1,700 for the 2022 tax year. This will provide a real benefit to all individuals who pay tax by reducing their tax liability and will ensure that some low and part time workers will remain outside income tax net.   </p>  <p>  The 2% rate band ceiling for USC was also increased in line with the increase in the national minimum wage to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate will remain outside the top rates of USC.  </p>  <p>  Having regard to the fiscal demands and pressures facing the State, it was not possible to index all elements of the personal income tax system nor was it possible to fully index tax credits and standard rate tax bands in line with expected earnings growth and remain within the fiscal parameters. However, the tax changes introduced in Budget 2022, will benefit all income earners who pay income tax.   </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight is currently undertaking work in relation to indexation of the taxation and social protection systems, and that my officials recently attended the Committee to assist the Members with their work in this regard.   I understand that one of the key points to emerge from presentations made to the Committee is that, historically, changes to tax and welfare parameters have, on average, kept pace with earnings notwithstanding that we have not had in place a system of automatic indexation.</p></reply>

Where this resulted in an underpayment of tax after all tax credits and reliefs, for example health expenses, were allocated, the amount due could be collected, interest-free, over four years commencing on 1 January 2022. </p>  <p>  As taxpayers&rsquo; liabilities may have been reduced by these additional reliefs or credits, it is not possible to quantify the exact amounts repaid that related specifically to TWSS or PUP liabilities. Revenue has confirmed that, to date, almost 300,000 PAYE taxpayers who were in receipt of TWSS and/or PUP payments in 2020 have submitted income tax returns for that year and where liabilities arose, these were settled by immediate payment, by the employer paying the amount due on behalf of the employee, or by spreading the payment over four years. </p>  <p>  Revenue has also confirmed that there are approximately 290,000 PAYE taxpayers that were in receipt of TWSS and/or PUP payments that have not yet filed an income tax return for 2020 and who may have a tax liability for that year.

This was largely driven by energy inflation, which increased by an estimated 29 per cent. Pandemic-related effects, such as the impact of temporary VAT reductions, and technical factors, such as measurement issues, added further volatility.  Core inflation &ndash; which strips out energy and non-processed food inflation &ndash; was 2.5 per cent in January. </p><p>HICP inflation moderated slightly from 5.7 per cent to 5.0 per cent in Ireland in the same period.</p><p>The latest figures point to inflation, including energy prices, remaining high over the near-term, before gradually easing later this year. The ECB projects inflation to average 3.2 per cent this year but to decline to rates of 1.8 per cent in both 2023 and 2024.  Both the Commission and the ECB are confident that elevated inflation is largely linked to temporary factors, including supply-side constraints and the recovery in demand as our economies reopen.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the ECB is an independent institution with a mandate to maintain price stability, defined as around 2 per cent over the medium-term. The ECB currently expects inflation to fall slightly below 2 per cent by end-2022. </p><p>That said, energy prices can entail wide-ranging consequences for inflation and raise costs for businesses and families. In recognition of these potential social impacts, many Member States have introduced targeted measures to protect vulnerable households from energy poverty.</p><p>Ireland is one of these Member States.  In framing <i>Budget 2022</i>, I was conscious of these cost of living pressures and announced a range of measures including targeted social welfare initiatives. Last week, Minister McGrath and I announced a suite of further supports to aid households and to target the main underlying problem &ndash; higher energy prices. This is in addition to the electricity credit for households announced late last year.</p><p>In addition, at an EU level, the Commission has issued a <i>Communication on Tackling Rising Energy Prices</i>, and the matter was discussed at various Council configurations. The Communication emphasises the broad nature of the impact and policy response.</p><p>In short, my fellow Finance Ministers and I all agree that this is an important issue and that we need to continue closely monitoring inflation and energy price developments and the potential implications for our economies.</p></reply>

This Office is situated within the Department of Finance and is chaired by Minister of State Fleming. Its aims are to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance.</p><p>Since its establishment, the Office has had over 60 meetings with a range of stakeholders, including insurance companies and representative organisations, on issues surrounding competition. Of recent significance, in late 2021 Minister Fleming met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland, who have confirmed that they are committed to passing on savings from the new Personal Injury Guidelines, and other reforms, to customers. They also reiterated their support for the reform agenda and that they are adhering to the Guidelines in direct settlements with their clients. </p><p>Furthermore, the Office has also cooperated with the Central Bank to create a databank for new market entrants, which was launched on 8 February. This databank is anticipated to be an additional source of information for insurance providers who are considering entering the Irish market, as it provides quick access to key sources of information on insurance in Ireland, and sets out the high-quality work being done in data collection by the Central Bank, such as the National Claims Information Database (NCID). In addition, the Office is also actively working with IDA Ireland to help leverage the ongoing insurance reforms with the aim of targeting new entrants to the Irish market, or persuading current incumbents to expand their existing operations here.  </p><p>In conclusion, this Government is committed to securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland. In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure implementation of the Action Plan which should have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for all consumers. </p></reply>

In order to alleviate this pressure, last week, Minister McGrath and I announced a &euro;505 million package of measures to mitigate the cost of living pressures faced by households. This is a suite of policy measures targeted at the main underlying problem - higher energy prices. The increase in energy prices is primarily due to external factors such as higher oil prices and pandemic-induced bottlenecks in key regions. The rapid rebound in the domestic economy is also a factor. </p>  <p>  These measures come on top of the measures already announced in Budget 2022 to support households &ndash; such as increases in social welfare rates as well as increases in tax bands.</p>  <p>  While it is expected that the inflation rate will moderate from the second quarter of this year, I believe that it is appropriate for Government to respond to the increase in prices and help our citizens meet the challenges presented by the current cost of living, and that is what we have done. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that some sectors of the economy continue to trade profitably and perhaps even have experienced increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, all businesses, regardless of profitability, have faced additional costs in adapting to operate in accordance with public health guidelines &ndash; through the physical adaptation of premises to ensure social distancing, the provision of Personal Protective Equipment, and the facilitation of remote working.  </p>  <p>  We must acknowledge the important role played by innovative sectors of the economy. The growing digitalisation of business in recent years has allowed many parts of the economy to continue to function while others were forced to close. This has enabled home working and allowed trade in essential goods and services to continue.  Furthermore, the fact that sectors of the economy have continued to function has allowed Governments to extend supports to other sectors of the economy that have fared less well, particularly in areas such as hospitality and retail.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the trading profits of companies in Ireland are generally taxed at the standard Corporation Tax rate of 12.5%. Some of the main features of the current Corporation Tax regime are its simplicity and that it applies to a broad base. </p>  <p>  Imposing additional taxes on certain sectors would involve increased complexity and could change the attractiveness of Ireland's corporate tax regime. While it is possible that imposing such taxes could lead to theoretical gains, it could also potentially lead to lower levels of economic activity and to companies passing the additional tax burden onto their staff, customers, suppliers or investors. </p>  <p>  In addition it should be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax regime has been undergoing a process of significant reform in recent years. The Deputy will be aware that, on 8 October 2021, Ireland joined 135 other member jurisdictions of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework in reaching an historic two-pillar agreement to address the tax challenges that have arisen from digitalisation. </p>  <p>  Pillar One will see a re-allocation of a portion of the income of very large companies from source jurisdictions to market jurisdictions. Pillar Two will introduce a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% on businesses with a global turnover of greater than &euro;750 million annually.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been constructively engaged with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project from its outset in 2013 and we have diligently reformed our tax system to ensure that it is in line with emerging international norms. </p>  <p>  In consideration of the need for certainty regarding our corporation tax regime, and acknowledgment of the significant amendments being made to corporation tax internationally, I do not believe it is appropriate to introduce any additional taxes or levies on companies at this time.</p></reply>

To qualify, among other conditions, an individual must own at least 5% of the business and have spent a certain proportion of their time working in the business as a director or employee for three out of the previous five years, prior to disposal. </p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that in respect of 2019, the most recent available year, the tax expenditure foregone for entrepreneurial relief was &euro;94 million. The average cost per claimant was &euro;96,600. The number of claims greater than &euro;1 million was 189. It should be noted that claims can exceed &euro;1 million in a year arising from spouses claiming the relief on a single return.</p>  <p>  An external review by Indecon Consultants of the Revised CGT Entrepreneur Relief was published as part of the Budget 2020 documentation. While the Indecon review identified a number of possible amendments and improvements it also recommended retaining the relief. Retaining this relief ensures stability and consistency for businesses and individuals and allows them to plan and organise their affairs with a degree of certainty. However an evaluation before the end of 2024 (when the relief is due to expire) would allow consideration of the appropriate next steps for this relief.</p></reply>

This is a well-established and broadly accepted principle. </p>  <p>  Section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, sets out that tax under Schedule E shall be charged in respect of every public office or employment of profit. Section 112 of the TCA 1997 brings into charge all salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits of any kind arising from an office or employment. Therefore, the long-standing position is that all tips, gratuities and service charges arising from an office or employment are chargeable to income tax under Schedule E in accordance with Section 112. </p>  <p>  Gratuities from customers for example, service charges in hotels or tips in restaurants, paid to the employer and subsequently paid out to an employee should be included in pay for the income tax week or month in which they are paid out. These tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system. However, in a situation where an employee receives tips directly from customers, the employer is not obliged to operate PAYE and in that case, the tips and gratuities are fully taxable and should be included by the employee in his or her income tax return. It is important to point out that such tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system.</p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is progressing legislation on tips and gratuities and this legislation will prohibit the practise of using tips or gratuities to top up wages. It will also ensure that electronic tips and gratuities, which are much more common these days, have to be divided fairly and equitably among the staff. In addition, the legislation will provide transparency to customers so they will know what the policy is on tips and service charges, how they are managed and to whom they go.</p>  <p>  For the reasons outlined in the opening paragraphs of my reply, I have no plans to amend the tax treatment of tips and gratuities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-22a.172.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022200056#WRC03500"><p>It should be noted that, as with investment vehicles generally, taxation in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs) occurs primarily at the level of the investor rather than within the investment vehicle. Additionally, both REITs and IREFs apply withholding taxes on distributions to investors to ensure collection of tax revenues.</p>  <p>  Finance Act 2013 introduced the regime for the operation of REIT companies in Ireland. The purpose of the REIT regime is to allow for a collective investment vehicle which provides a comparable after-tax return to investors to direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply. REITs are required to distribute 85% of all property income profits annually to investors. Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) at a rate of 25% must be applied to these distributions, other than those distributed to certain limited classes of investors such as pensions and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.</p>  <p>  An IREF is an investment undertaking where 25% or more of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets. The legislation was introduced to address concerns raised regarding the use of collective investment vehicles by non-residents to invest in Irish property. Generally IREFs must deduct a 20% withholding tax on distributions to non-resident investors. Certain categories of investors such as pension funds, life assurance companies and other collective investment undertakings are generally exempt from having IREF withholding tax applied provided the appropriate declarations are in place. Irish resident investors may be subject to the investment undertakings exit tax, at a rate of 41%.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department produced a report on REITs and IREFs as respects their investment in the Irish property market in 2019.  The report was presented to the Tax Strategy Group and provided a basis for policy discussions and for amendments which were introduced in Finance Act 2019 to strengthen the regimes.</p>  <p>  In relation to REITs, Finance Act 2019 extended the obligation to deduct DWT to include distributions of the proceeds of capital disposals. In addition, the deemed disposal provisions upon cessation of REIT status were restricted to REITs that have been in operation for at least 15 years, in line with the regime's stated objective of encouraging long-term, stable investment in rental property. In relation to IREFs, amendments were made in Finance Act 2019 to prevent the use of excessive debt and other payments to reduce distributable profits, and to prevent the avoidance of tax on gains on the redemption of IREF units. These amendments were made to ensure appropriate levels of tax are paid by investors in Irish property.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to conduct a further review the tax treatment of REITs or IREFs. However officials in my Department and the Revenue Commissioners monitor the taxation of IREFs and REITs on an ongoing basis and, should additional issues be identified, I will take further action as necessary.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that the second Implementation Report will be brought to Government by An T&aacute;naiste very shortly and published thereafter. That report will show that the majority of the 66 reforms being delivered under this agenda are now complete, including many principal actions. Key reforms to date include:</p><p>- the publication of the General Scheme of a Bill to enhance and reform the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board</i>(PIAB);</p><p>- the launch of a databank for new entrants by the Central Bank of Ireland;</p><p>- the establishment of the <i>Insurance Fraud Co-ordination Office</i>within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau;</p><p>- the publication of the Final Report of the Central Bank&rsquo;s <i>Review of Differential Pricing in the Motor and Home Insurance Markets;</i></p><p><i>- </i>the expansion of the <i>National Claims Information Database</i>to gather data on employers&rsquo; and public liability insurance, and the publication of the first report on same;</p><p>- the publication of the Central Bank&rsquo;s third <i>National Claims Information Database</i>report on private motor insurance;</p><p>- the enactment of the <i>Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021;</i></p><p>- the implementation of the <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines;</i></p><p>- the creation of the <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market;</i>and</p><p>- the introduction of new regulations on solicitors advertising</p><p>In addition, my officials are continuing to advance the <i>Insurance (Miscellaneous Provision) Bill</i>, to address a number of separate, but related issues that complement the Action Plan. This is expected to be published in the coming weeks, and we will seeking to have it prioritised for passage through the Oireachtas. </p><p>The focus of the Sub-Group now is on implementing the outstanding reforms as soon as possible, with particular regard to:</p><p>- reforming the law on occupier&rsquo;s liability to rebalance the duty of care;</p><p>- enhancing the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission through the Competition Amendment Bill; and</p><p>- reforming the PIAB, with a view to increasing the number of cases settled by the Board</p><p>Overall, it is felt that the range of measures being pursued under the Action Plan will lead to an improvement in the insurance market. Throughout 2022, both Minister of State Fleming and I will continue our widespread engagement with industry and other stakeholders to ensure that the benefits of these reforms are being passed on and are felt, first and foremost, by policyholders.</p></reply>

While the overall venture capital sector in Ireland is strong and continues to grow, there is a trend towards growth being driven by larger, later stage deals and investments. The Irish market is producing ambitious founders with strong technical expertise and a drive to innovate in much greater numbers, so the need to nurture seed and scaling activities in Ireland remains very important.</p>  <p>  The &euro;90m fund programme is made up of a &euro;30m investment from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment (DETE), through Enterprise Ireland (EI), which is matched by a &euro;30m investment from the European Investment Fund (EIF). The &euro;60m fund will be managed by EIF. The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) will seek to co-invest a further &euro;30m alongside on a deal by deal basis.</p>  <p>  Establishment of the fund programme enhances the growing relationship between Enterprise Ireland, the EIF and ISIF. The &euro;90m fund programme will attract both new fund managers and new private investors and will crowd-in significant private investment.</p>  <p>  All investments are expected to be made within a three-year timeframe. The investments are forecast to have a 10-year life. Investments will be targeted and prioritised in areas that have experienced difficulty in attracting investment, such as funds that invest in companies with a focus on regional development, climate change and female entrepreneurship.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that our most innovative, early stage firms have been affected by the more cautious investment environment which followed the uncertainty of a pandemic. SMEs make up over 99% of our firms and employ over one million people across our cities, towns and villages. They are the lifeblood of our economy and we will continue to depend on their innovations and successes to secure the future, sustained economic growth of our country.</p></reply>

Ireland does not ratify international conventions until it has been determined that national law is in line with the provisions of the international instrument.  </p>  <p>  Convention 190 is the first ever international instrument on the very important issues of eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work. Ireland already has very strong protections in law to combat violence and harassment in the world of work and has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence - that is, the Istanbul Convention.  </p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment have engaged with all relevant Government Departments and offices to establish the extent to which domestic legislative provisions already provide for the rights and entitlements included in the Convention, as well as legislative amendments, if any, that may be required to enable ratification.</p>  <p>  The Department is conducting an analysis of the outcomes and engaging with legal advisers to ensure that there are no gaps.</p>  <p>  Following this consideration, as part of the ratification process, my Department will undertake a stakeholder consultation with trade unions, employer representative bodies and other interested parties. </p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the Deputy of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to work towards being amongst the first ILO member States to ratify Convention 190.</p></reply>

Whether it is starting a business or growing a business there is something suitable for anyone wishing to start or advance their entrepreneurial journey. </p>  <p>  In particular, I would encourage the person to enquire about the Start Your Own Business Programme. </p>  <p>  The objective is to assist entrepreneurs in assessing their business idea, its viability and helps them decide if they should proceed or take a step back. The programme covers topics such as starting up/getting started, identifying, understanding, and researching your target market, developing a business plan amongst other vital areas of interest to a new business. </p>  <p>  I would also suggest seeking the advice of a LEO Business Mentor; the Mentor programme is open to both new and existing businesses located within the Local Enterprise Office region and is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance. </p>  <p>  The mentor contributes independent, informed observation and advice to aid decision making. Mentors can also advise on finance options available to entrepreneurs and can assist with applications and referrals to Micro-Finance Ireland, which provides vital support to eligible microenterprises by lending to businesses that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders and who do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders. It offers loan funding, including Start-up Loans, from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000. </p></reply>

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.  The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations.</p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the State and other EEA states.  Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, an employment permit may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national.</p>  <p>  All employment permits granted are employer and employee specific and therefore cannot be transferred from one employer to another.  This means that if a permit holder ceases employment with a company or is made redundant, they must obtain a new employment permit before entering a new employment.</p>  <p>  When an employment permit holder is made redundant from their employment, they are required to notify the Employment Permits Section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment within 4 weeks of the redundancy date on the prescribed Redundancy Notification form, available on the Department's website.</p>  <p>  By Completing the Redundancy Notification Form appropriately, an employment permit holder has up to six months from the date on which their employment ceases to find another job.  The new permit application is exempt from certain rules that would otherwise apply including the requirement to complete a Labour Market Needs Test in respect of a new application for a General Employment Permit in respect of a new job offer.</p>  <p>  Occupations included on the Ineligible List are occupations where there is evidence that there are more than enough Irish/EEA workers available to fill such vacancies, and therefore an employment permit shall not be granted in Ireland.  Every other job in the labour market, where an employer cannot find a worker, may be eligible for an employment permit.</p>  <p>  In cases of redundancy, if the permit holder is in an occupation which is now ineligible for the type of employment permit held, and they are offered the same job by a different employer, an employment permit application will still be considered for the same employment permit type.</p>  <p>  The redundancy waivers for permit holders who have been made redundant are valid for a period of 6 months from the date of redundancy. Details in relation to permit holders being made redundant can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website through this link:- enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Redundancy/</p>  <p>  Information is also provided on the Department&rsquo;s website in respect of all employment permits including information regarding to each permit type, Checklist documents for a General Employment Permits and an FAQ document which answers the majority of the most common questions, all of which are available through this link &ndash; enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/</p>  <p>  Information in relation to changing employers is available on the Department&rsquo;s website and can be accessed through the following link:-  enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Changing-Employer/. </p></reply>

These are the director&rsquo;s fiduciary duties which are owed to the company.  Section 228 of the Companies Act 2014 sets out the principal fiduciary duties of directors which are to:</p><p>- act in good faith in what the director considers to be the interest of the company;</p><p>- act honestly and responsibly in relation to the conduct of the affairs of the company;</p><p>- act in accordance with the company&rsquo;s constitution and exercise his or her powers only for the purposes allowed by law;</p><p>- not benefit from or use the company&rsquo;s property, information or opportunities for his or her own or anyone else&rsquo;s benefit unless the company&rsquo;s constitution permits it or a resolution is passed in a general meeting; </p><p>- not agree to restrict the director&rsquo;s power to exercise an independent judgment unless this is expressly permitted by the company&rsquo;s constitution; </p><p>- avoid any conflict between the director&rsquo;s duties to the company and the director&rsquo;s other interests unless the director is released from his or her duty to the company in relation to the matter concerned; </p><p>- exercise the care, skill and diligence which would be reasonably expected of a person in the same position with similar knowledge and experience as a director. </p><p>Where a director of a company acts in breach of his or duty, he or she may be liable to indemnify the company for any loss or damage arising from that breach.</p></reply>

This is specifically set out in Section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part Time Work) Act 2001.</p>  <p>  The evolution of the main elements of labour law in Ireland relating to employment rights, employment protection and non-discrimination, reflects, at the national level, a strong focus on the enactment of legislation based on clearly identified needs, in addition to those arising from wider European Union developments. </p>  <p>  A "posted worker" is an employee who is sent by his/ her employer to carry out a service in another EU Member State on a temporary basis. Council Directive 96/71/EC defines a posted worker as a &lsquo;person who, for a limited period of time, carries out his or her work in the territory of an EU Member State other than the State in which he or she normally works&rsquo;. If an Irish worker is posted to another EEA country they are protected under this directive, which was transposed into Irish Law by the Protection of Employees (Part Time Work Act) 2001. </p>  <p>  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights applicable to employees they may refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court. WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.</p>  <p>  I appreciate people&rsquo;s frustration when they are living close to a fibre network, owned by a commercial operator, but cannot get a connection to that network. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the commercial operator referred to in the Question, the provision of telecommunication services is a matter for the relevant service providers operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communication Regulation (ComReg), as independent Regulator. As set out in the Programme for Government, ensuring access to high-quality internet connections for people across Ireland is essential to the development of all parts of our country, socially and economically. Facilitating remote working and innovation opportunities is essential for addressing climate change, adapting in an evolving economy, and competing internationally. A combination of commercial investment and the State led National Broadband Plan intervention will ensure access to high speed broadband in every part of the country no matter how remote.</p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 11 February, over 300,000 have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 157,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and over 54,500 premises are available to order and pre-order across 21 counties.  In County Clare surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Feakle and Corofin, which includes the premises referred to in the question, and main works are underway in the Deployment Area of Kilkishen. To date almost 8,000 premises in County Clare have been surveyed, with over 3,500 premises under construction and over 1,500 premises now available to order or pre-order.  </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Clare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website, www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 11 February 2022, 486 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Clare 7 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date, including Obair Family Centre which is approximately 14.3km from the premises referred to. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.</p>  <p>  In County Clare 12 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/. </p></reply>

The CRU has decided upon a competitive market-based approach to the setting of this tariff, as well as a number of provisions to ensure that its implementation aligns with the National Smart Metering Programme.</p><p>  It is envisaged that initial payments or credits from suppliers will be available after June of this year and the CRU has requested that suppliers communicate their decision on when initial CEG payments will be made to customers at the earliest opportunity. The supplier may offer back-payments in the form of a credit to an account, if this approach is considered to be the most appropriate. The CRU also expects back-payments to be communicated clearly to customers of each supplier.</p><p>  Furthermore, a tax disregard of &euro;200 was introduced in Budget 2021 in respect of personal income received by households who sell residual renewable electricity, which they generate, back to the grid.</p></reply>

It will also facilitate the achievement of the goal to generate up to 80% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland's economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.</p>  <p>  The option of undergrounding the North-South Interconnector has been comprehensively assessed on several occasions. Most recently, the key finding from the International Expert Commission's report of October 2018 was that an overhead line remains the most appropriate option for this critical electricity infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I decided to commission a further short review to assess if the overall finding from the 2018 report remains valid. Formal procurement of international experts in electricity grid infrastructure was completed last September. Whilst my Department had hoped to receive their report before now, the experts have informed my officials that they plan to submit it to the Department by next month. I plan to publish it shortly after I have received and considered it. </p></reply>

This will support an increase in the number of free home upgrades, from an average of 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month this year, helping to reduce waiting times and clear Covid impacted backlogs. </p><p>In changes recently agreed by Government, for the first time, applications can now be accepted from qualifying homeowners who previously received supports under the Scheme, but who could still benefit from even deeper measures. The Scheme eligibility criteria will also be extended to include those in receipt of the Disability Allowance for over 6 months and have a child under 7 years. The Scheme will also target the worst performing properties, by prioritising homes that were built and occupied before 1993 and have a pre-works BER of E, F or G. Existing applications will not be affected by this change. </p><p>The key eligibility criteria are outlined below:</p><p>1. Must own and live in your own home</p><p>2.

The proposed technology includes synchronous condensers and energy storage capabilities at both  locations. Detailed environmental assessments will be carried out in support of those applications; and</p>  <p>  - should these applications be successful, the ESB&rsquo;s plans would then enable the company to successfully develop these sites within the appropriate regulatory, environmental and planning timelines.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that he management of ESB-owned facilities is an operational matter for the Board and management of the ESB.</p></reply>

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets, is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. The CRU, as the Deputy will appreciate, is an independent statutory regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions, including more generally on the matter raised in this question, to the Oireachtas, and not to me as Minister. In this regard, I understand that the CRU appeared before Committee on Environment and Climate Action as recently as the 15th February to answer its questions on these and other matters.More broadly, and in view of the current pressures faced by households following the exceptional recent rise in international energy prices, I introduced The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022, that will provide for a credit payment, on a once off basis in 2022, to each domestic electricity account amounting to &euro;200 (including VAT).

The NBP roll out is currently a 7 year plan under the contract and deployment is due to be complete by the end of 2026.</p>  <p>  Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan. I am advised by NBI that, as of 11 February 2022, over 300,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 157,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and over 54,500 premises are available to order and pre-order across 21 counties.  </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website, www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond.  This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.</p>  <p>  NBI has implemented a number of measures to help lessen the impact that these challenges have had on the rollout including:-</p>  <p>  - Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month;</p>  <p>  - Bringing in additional NBI resources;</p>  <p>  - Earlier procurement of material used in the build stages; and</p>  <p>  - Bringing in additional subcontractors</p>  <p>  It remains the ambition of the Government to rollout the National Broadband Plan as quickly as possible. My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. However, the primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the National Broadband Ireland build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p></reply>

These measures are aimed at making it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills and reduced emissions.</p>  <p>  These new measures include:</p>  <p>  - The establishment of the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offering increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump (up from the current level of 30-35%). </p>  <p>  - Establishment of a network of registered One Stop Shops to offer a new end-to-end project management service. This includes surveying the home; designing the upgrades; managing the grant processes; helping with access to finance; engaging the contractors to deliver the work and then quality-assuring that work.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the One Stop Shops will be distributed across Ireland, with a considerable number capable of offering services nationwide, due to the network of contractors they are working with throughout the country. Other One Stop Shops are expected to work within geographic regions. This will ensure that every home can benefit from the One Stop Shop service on offer.</p>  <p>  The capital funding available for the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme is &euro;97 million, with a &euro;40 million allocation in 2022 and &euro;57 million in 2023. This is expected to deliver 2,000 deep energy retrofits to B2 level with a heat pump in 2022 and an additional 3,000 in 2023.</p>  <p>  The new one stop shop model is suitable for bringing together groups of homes for aggregated projects thereby creating efficiencies in delivery and developing new innovation in processes and technologies.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Community Energy Grant Scheme makes grant funding available for community-based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area. The Scheme is designed to support cross-sectoral, partnership approaches that deliver energy savings to a range of building types including public, commercial and community buildings, with a particular focus on using the projects to deliver home retrofits. </p>  <p>  The total budget for the Community Energy Grant scheme will be &euro;43 million in 2022, of which approximately &euro;15 million will relate to home retrofits. The new grant rates announced under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme will also be available under the Community Energy Grant scheme for homeowners wishing to undertake their energy upgrades as part of a community project</p>  <p>  Registration for companies wishing to apply to be a one stop shop is now open. I expect the first One Stop Shops to be registered within the coming weeks. Homeowners can then make applications for upgrades. The call for projects under the Community Energy Grant scheme will be launched shortly.</p></reply>

Window and door replacement are also available in some circumstances under the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme which delivers free upgrades to eligible homeowners in low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.Window and door replacements are not supported under the Better Energy Homes Scheme, where homeowners can choose to carry out works on a step by step, and/or, self-managed basis.</p>  <p>  The residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme is part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan and will be co-financed by the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility and Exchequer funding. The target for introduction of the scheme is Q3-2022. The loan guarantee will enable credit institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates to private homeowners and non-corporate landlords and make comprehensive home energy efficiency upgrades even more affordable and accessible to more consumers. </p>  <p>  The parameters for the loans under the guarantee have not been finalised yet. However, the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility funding sets a number of conditions the guarantee must comply with. One of those is that at least 75% of loans issued under the guarantee are used for medium-depth retrofit projects. Medium-depth level renovation is defined as upgrades achieving primary energy savings of between 30% and 60%, as per Commission Recommendation on Building Renovation (EU) 2019/786. Consequently, the low-cost retrofit loans under the guarantee will predominantly, though not exclusively, target comprehensive home energy upgrade projects.</p></reply>

This includes homes that are at various stages of the process: awaiting the initial survey of their home; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor; have been allocated to a contractor for works; or, are currently undergoing works. It is important to note that activity under the Scheme in 2020 and 2021 was significantly impacted by COVID-related restrictions on the construction sector, given the nature of retrofit works, and this led to a large increase in the number of homes awaiting works. </p>  <p>  The 2022 budget, at &euro;109 million, is the highest ever and is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million). This will support an increase in the number of homes retrofitted under the scheme from 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month (or a total of 4,800) this year. The level of activity to be undertaken in 2023 will be determined , taking account of progress this year and as part of the 2023 Estimates process.</p></reply>

The aim of the review is to align the EU ETS Directive with the target set out in the European Climate Law to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels). The proposal makes provision for an extension of the existing ETS 'cap and trade' system to a new separate emissions trading system that would apply at the point at which fuels for the buildings and road transport sectors are placed on the market.</p>  <p>  The proposal to extend the emissions trading system is of significant importance to Ireland, as the greenhouse gas emissions associated with fuel used in these sectors are currently subject to the domestic carbon tax. Changes to our existing carbon tax would affect the expected revenues from scheduled annual increases to 2030, as provided for in the Finance Acts. The Government intends to ring-fence these revenues for a range of climate action programmes including residential retrofit, targeted increases in social welfare payments and other initiatives to prevent fuel poverty, and funding to encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way.</p>  <p>  Ireland is now in the process of engaging, through negotiations in the Environment Council of Ministers, on all aspects of the &lsquo;Fit for 55&rsquo; package of proposals, to ensure that the ambitions of the package can be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, balancing considerations of fairness and solidarity between and within Member States.</p></reply>

These measures are aimed at making it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills and emissions.</p>  <p>  Included in these measures is the establishment of the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offering increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump (up from the current level of 30-35%).</p>  <p>  The total capital funding cost for the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme is &euro;97 million with a &euro;40 million allocation in 2022 and &euro;57 million in 2023. This is expected to deliver 2,000 deep energy retrofits to B2 level with a heat pump in 2022 and an additional 3,000 in 2023.</p>  <p>  The SEAI registration portal for companies to apply to be a One-Stop-Shop is now open. It is expected that the first One-Stop-Shops will be registered in the coming weeks. Homeowners can then make applications for upgrades. </p></reply>

No. 203/2009 - Road Traffic (Driving Instructor Licensing) (No. 2) Regulations 2009 the Road Safety Authority (RSA) is legally required to carry out a check test of an Approved Driving Instructor every two years at the very minimum. This test takes the form of an observation by an RSA examiner of a lesson given by the instructor to a learner driver and is considered an essential element in the regulation and continuous professional development of driving instructors.</p>  <p>  Driving is a complex and multi-faceted skill and instructors shoulder a considerable responsibility in teaching their students to behave safely and responsibly on the roads at all times. It is for this reason that it is imperative that the RSA have a means of ensuring that all instructors maintain the highest of teaching standards in the years after they have completed their initial qualification. It is important that we do not allow the current pandemic to unnecessarily undermine the very significant progress we have made in reducing the impact of road collisions on public health and health services.</p></reply>

These supports comprise specific measures designed to support the sector, with a view to addressing statutory costs faced by operators which cannot be deferred. Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and are being waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million. The NTA has put in place schemes to refund the motor tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022, and to waive NCT fees for the same period. Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website.  The NTA has also waived standard age limits for taxis and hackneys through to the end of 2022, thereby ensuring no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle. </p>  <p>  Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles, I announced on February 4th last, the re-opening of the eSPSV Grant Scheme, with a further &euro;15 million allocated to it for 2022.  The take-up rate for this Scheme was exceptionally high in 2021: almost 600 drivers successfully applied for grants, with over &euro;11 million paid out as well as &euro;4 million in provisional grant offers. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy should be aware that the NTA has now started work on a new National Maximum Fare Review and is engaging with its service providers in the matter.  This Review, which is undertaken on a regular basis by the NTA, assesses any changes in the market facing the taxi industry as well as changes in annual taxi operating costs.  These costs include the fixed and running costs of an average taxi and labour costs.  The objective of the Review is to determine whether changes need to be made to the current level of maximum fares and the NTA has confirmed that it is endeavouring to conclude the review process as quickly as possible in 2022 whilst still ensuring that all steps, including a consultation process, are appropriately completed. </p>  <p>  More generally, in relation to recent price increases and their impact on consumers, Government announced a suite of policy measures designed to support all households on February 10th. These measures take account of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices and come on top of the measures already taken in Budget 2022 to support households &ndash; such as increases in social welfare rates as well as increases in tax bands, and also the electricity credit for households which the Government agreed on last year in recognition of the impact of rising energy costs.</p></reply>

The Department, through TII, are funding over 40 Greenway projects around the country, some on disused or closed railway lines. TII are also developing a National Cycle Network Strategy that will identify routes to be developed over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The issue with utilising in-use railway corridors is whether it is safe to do so and the views of the Commission for Railway Regulation would need to be sought in the first instance. There is also the issue of width, is there enough space within Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's ownership, or would additional land purchase be required. There would need to be adequate fencing installed to separate people walking and cycling from the railway line, and bridges and tunnels pose challenges especially along in-use railway corridors. However, the balance of considerations can favour running a greenway beside a railway in the right circumstances and planning approval and Government funding has been granted for the Broadmeadow Greenway along the railway causeway across Broadmeadow Estuary which is expected to go to construction next year. </p>  <p>  We will bring the issue to the attention of TII as they work on their National Cycle Network Strategy.</p></reply>

During the 1980s it became clear that an insufficient number of countries were ever going to ratify the Convention.  This led to the adoption in 1993 of the Torremolinos Protocol of 1993 Relating to the Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, 1977 (SFV PROT 1993).  Again, the rate of ratifications was insufficient to allow the Protocol to enter into force.</p>  <p>  The EU considered that the safety of large fishing vessels was a matter that they should legislate on.  Thus, Directive 97/70/EC was adopted (later amended by Directive 2002/35/EC).  The Directives were based on the provisions of the Protocol and were transposed into Irish legislation via S.I. 417 of 2002 and S.I. 418 of 2002 which remain the relevant Irish legislation in relation to the regulation of the construction standards, etc. of fishing vessels of >24m.  Ireland ratified the Torremolinos Protocol and applies the requirements as contained in Directive 97/70/EC.  Therefore for fishing vessels >24m, a higher level of regulation is maintained for such Irish fishing vessels or foreign-flagged fishing vessels in Irish waters compared to the level of regulation that is set out in the Cape Town Agreement.  However, Ireland recognises that ratifying the Agreement will help towards reaching the threshold for its entry into force which would eventually lead to increased safety standards for fishing vessels >24m around the world. </p>  <p>  In summary, the position on the Cape Town Agreement is that Ireland should and will ratify the Agreement to assist in the push towards reaching the threshold for its entry into force.  However, primary legislation is required to ratify the Agreement.  It is intended to include provisions regarding the Agreement in the next Merchant Shipping Bill that deals with international conventions.</p></reply>

To meet the demand for tests, approval has been given to significantly increase the capacity of the service through the recruitment and extension of a number of existing driver tester contracts. This, and the introduction of a new booking system for tests, have had a noticeable impact on reducing Covid waiting list backlogs. </p>  <p>  Pre-pandemic, the average waiting time target for a driving test was ten weeks, although on the immediate eve of the pandemic the actual waiting time was around six and a half weeks. This increased to 25 weeks during the Pandemic. With the improving public health situation, the pre-pandemic average national waiting time target of ten weeks was achieved in the last few weeks. </p></reply>

When this is done, I shall engage with the Committee with a view to beginning Committee stage as soon as possible.

PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax and appropriate insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them and they may not be used on public roads and in public places.  However, their use is permitted on private land, with the permission of the landowner. While their use on public roads (including footways) is illegal, I am aware that there has been some confusion over the legal constraints on their use.</p>  <p>  It is intended to legislate for e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government as soon as possible, so that they may be used on our roads within a clear legal framework. Provision has been made for this in the Road Traffic and Roads Bill, which has completed second stage in the Dail and is due to go to committee stage shortly. </p>  <p>  In order to allow for the rapid pace of technological change in this area, specific controls on the use of e-scooters will be set out in regulations, following the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. The use of e-scooters on public roads will become legal only once these regulations are in place.</p></reply>

At the outset, I would like to point out that there is no single solution to reducing insurance costs. This is why the Government is pursuing insurance reform on a whole-of-Government basis, through 66 cross-departmental actions in the Insurance Reform Action Plan, including, but not limited to, the Personal Injuries Guidelines. </p>  <p>  The National Claims Information Database (NCID) has already proven to be an excellent tool when it comes to collecting information on the cost of claims and pricing trends. The NCID will continue to contribute to evidence-based decision making and will help to provide greater market-focussed transparency in the insurance sector. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank indicated in its most recent NCID Motor Report that it intends to collect additional claim settlement data for all classes of business within the remit of the NCID so as to obtain further information on the impact of the Personal Injuries Guidelines on claims settlement. I understand that it intends to collect data that will allow it to distinguish claims settled under the new Guidelines from those settled under previous arrangements (i.e. the Book of Quantum), which will provide insight into the impact of the Guidelines on settling claims.</p>  <p>  In light of these proposed enhancements, I believe that the NCID remains an effective mechanism to objectively monitor whether savings arising from the Guidelines, as well as the suite of other reform measures being pursued by this Government, are being passed on to customers.  Accordingly, no further legislative changes are necessitated at this point.</p></reply>

To qualify as a single person for the purposes of the SPCCC, the claimant must not be jointly assessed for income tax as a married person or civil partner, or be living with his or her spouse or civil partner, or be cohabiting with a partner. </p>  <p>  The value of the credit is &euro;1,650 for each tax year. In addition to the credit, a claimant is entitled to an additional &euro;4,000 on the standard rate income tax band. An individual can only receive one SPCCC irrespective of the number of qualifying children residing with him or her. </p>  <p>  The credit is ordinarily given to the primary claimant. The primary claimant is the individual who proves that a qualifying child resides with him or her for the whole or the greater part of the tax year (i.e. a period greater than six months) and that the child is either his or her own or has been placed in his or her custody. A primary claimant can relinquish entitlement to the SPCCC to a secondary claimant. The secondary claimant can then claim the credit if he or she qualifies as a single person and the qualifying child resides with him or her for at least 100 days throughout the tax year. Detailed information on the SPCCC can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website at: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-41.pdf, which may be of interest to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it has reviewed the changed circumstances of the person in question and is satisfied that he now has full custody of one child while continuing to share custody for the second child and on that basis is entitled to claim the credit as a primary claimant.

The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant such as a grandchild of the disponer. The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases.  </p>  <p>  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts or inheritances that are in excess of his or her relevant tax-free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess benefit. </p>  <p>  While a disponer may have no natural children, any stepchildren, adopted children or certain foster children can avail of the Group A threshold in respect of gifts and inheritances received from that disponer. </p>  <p>  In addition, nieces or nephews of that disponer may qualify for favourite niece or favourite nephew relief in respect of gifts or inheritances of business assets. The relief allows a niece or nephew who qualifies for the relief to avail of the Group A threshold. Qualifying nieces or nephews are those who have worked substantially on a full-time basis for a period of five years prior to the gift or inheritance being given in carrying on, or assisting in the carrying on, the trade, business or profession, of the disponer.    </p>  <p>  For the nephew or niece to be deemed to be working substantially on a full-time basis in the business he or she must work: </p>  <p>  - more than 24 hours per week at the place where the business, trade or profession is carried on; or </p>  <p>  - more than 15 hours per week at the place where the business, trade or profession is carried on exclusively by the disponer, any spouse or civil partner of the disponer and the nephew or niece.</p>  <p>  The options available for providing increases to CAT thresholds are  considered in the context of available resources  as part of the annual budgetary process and like all matters need to be balanced against competing demands.  At the moment, I do not believe that a compelling case can be made for increasing the CAT Group threshold that applies to a sibling, niece or nephew.</p></reply>

This section, as amended, provides Income Tax relief for certain individuals assigned during any of the tax years 2012 to 2022 to work in the State. The relief is commonly known as SARP (Special Assignee Relief Programme).</p><p>The aim of the relief is to reduce the cost to employers of assigning skilled individuals in their companies from abroad to take up positions in the Irish-based operations of their employer or an associated company, thereby facilitating the creation of jobs and the development and expansion of businesses in Ireland.</p><p>SARP provides for relief from Income Tax on 30% of income over &euro;75,000, subject to an upper income threshold of &euro;1,000,000, where applicable. There is no exemption from USC. PRSI is payable where the individual is not liable to social insurance contributions in his or her home country. School fees of up to &euro;5,000 per annum and expenses incurred on one trip home per year, where they are paid for by the employer, are not subject to Income Tax, USC or PRSI.</p><p>I am advised that the latest costs available for the Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP) can be found in the 2019 SARP report which is published on the Revenue website and as part of the Budget 2022 Tax Expenditures Report on the Government's Budget 2022 website.</p><p>The cost of SARP for 2018 and 2019 (the latest year for which data are available) is set out below. <table>    <tr>       <th>SARP</th>       <th><div>2018</div></th>       <th><div>2019</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cost (&euro;m)</td>       <td><div>42.4</div></td>       <td><div>38.2</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I expect that figures in relation to 2020 will be published later this year and that figures in respect of 2021 will become available next year.</p></reply>

The findings of this review are set out as part of the Report on Tax Expenditures 2021 which was published on 12th October on the Gov.ie website as part of the package of papers associated with Budget 2022.</p><p>The four agri-tax reliefs/tax credits covered, where eligibility is (amongst other factors) determined subject to an age limit, are:</p><p>1. Stock relief for young trained farmers (section 667B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) </p><p>2. Stock relief for registered farm partnerships (section 667C of the TCA 1997)</p><p>3. Succession Farm Partnerships (Tax Credit) (section 667D of the TCA 1997)  </p><p>4. Young trained farmer (stamp duty) relief (section 81AA of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999)</p><p>The report found that the age limits currently in place for each of these are consistent amongst themselves, and  that they remain appropriate in the context of their intended purpose. </p><p>It also noted that introducing special exemptions from those age limits, even in limited circumstances  would both add complexity to, and weaken the intended impact of, the age limits currently in place.</p><p>The report therefore recommended that no changes in the age limits applicable to the four reliefs concerned be recommended to  me.</p><p>In relation to the situation that was applicable over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, I am informed that, as with many other businesses, providers of the Green Cert. responded to the impact of the pandemic with contingency arrangements to ensure continuity of service.</p><p>Teagasc continued to deliver existing Level 5 and Level 6 green cert programmes in agricultural colleges and regional centres in accordance with the national Covid-19 guidelines for provision of further and higher education. Contingencies were introduced in line with QQI guidance which enabled Teagasc programmes (full-time, distance education and part-time) to maintain their schedule of delivery. This included increased use of online learning technology to support teaching and learning in addition to  on-campus skills training.</p><p>Teagasc also continued to recruit students and has commenced a number of new green cert programmes nationwide over the past two years, with over 30 part-time/distance education green cert courses commencing during 2021 alone.</p><p>I  therefore see no need to provide any extension of, or exemption from, the age limits currently in effect.</p></reply>

The relief for gifts is agreed and harmonised at EU level and the provisions are common throughout the 27 EU Member States.  </p>  <p>  Under EU legislation, the relief of Customs Duty and VAT for gifts applies where the Customs Value of the consignment sent is less than &euro;45. The Customs value is the value of the item plus the cost of transport and insurance. This also includes the cost of postage where consignments are sent via the postal network. Where the value of the gifts imported from outside of the European Union exceeds this &euro;45 threshold, then the applicable rates of Customs Duty and VAT apply.</p></reply>

However, such written documentation may reasonably be expected to include information such as the nature of the claim, the nature of the relationship between the parties involved or a high-level summary of the allegations and the impact of same. The employee need not engage an external advisor to prepare such written documentation on their behalf and there is no requirement for the statement of claim to have been formally submitted to a relevant Authority, provided all other conditions set out above are met.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Where payments are made under the provisions of section 192A, generally a self-assessment approach applies and Revenue approval is not obligatory.  However, it is possible for an employer to seek Revenue approval if there is any doubt as to the application of the exemption.  As there is no formal application or approval process, Revenue advise that the details requested are not available.  However, it is important to note however, that where such payments to employees are encountered during the course of a Revenue compliance intervention, details of the payment would be examined to ensure they meet the requirements of the legislation.</p></reply>

It will then enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>  <p>  In the interim officials in my Department will be reviewing the options now available to Ireland in setting VAT rates.

Its primary purpose was to widen the tax base and to provide a steady income to the Exchequer to provide funding for public services.</p>  <p>  The USC is an individualised tax, meaning that a person&rsquo;s liability to the tax is determined on the basis of his/her own individual income and personal circumstances. The USC is applied at a low rate on a wide base, which ensures that it is a stable and sustainable source of revenue for the State.</p>  <p>  Currently individuals with incomes of less than &euro;13,000 are exempt from USC. For 2022, it is estimated that 28% of all taxpayer units will be exempt from USC.  I would also note that in recent Budgets, including Budget 2022, this Government actively increased the USC ceiling for the 2% rate in line with increases to the national minimum wage, to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate would remain outside the top rates of USC.</p>  <p>  The USC has played a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.  USC receipts have been central to the current stability of the public finances since March 2020, despite the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Receipts from the USC in 2021 amounted to &euro;4.4 billion &ndash; 16.5% of total income tax receipts or 6.4% of total Exchequer receipts. The projected USC yield for 2022 is broadly similar. If USC were to be abolished, it would be necessary to raise approximately &euro;4.4 billion from other sources. </p>  <p>  In 2016, joint Department of Finance/Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) research found that USC represented a more stable form of revenue than income tax. The findings highlighted that USC revenues would fluctuate by less than income tax revenues whenever income is volatile, for example where the economy moves from a boom into a bust. Given the openness of the Irish economy and consequent susceptibility to economic shocks, the contribution that the USC makes to the stability of the State&rsquo;s revenue sources is considerable.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that an inter-departmental working group was established in February 2018 to examine and report on options for the amalgamation of USC and PRSI over the medium-term. The Report of the Working Group can be located here: //assets.gov.ie/180893/1c9cd219-fb8a-47d2-86c3-d1cd9c3bcf03.pdf. </p>  <p>  The report acknowledged the complexity of the amalgamation proposal and confirmed that there is no single option that can deliver the proposed amalgamation without leading to implications at the individual level, with some people paying more, or significant loss of Revenue for the State overall.  In the light of the information brought forward in the report, the proposal has not been pursued.</p>  <p>  The Deputy refers to the concept of incorporating the USC into the wider taxation system. I have already referred to the examination of USC/PRSI above.  Another idea might be to incorporate the USC into the personal income tax system and, on the face it, a single unified income tax system may appear to offer advantages as compared with current arrangements.  However, many of the significant challenges outlined in &ldquo;The Report of the Working Group on the Amalgamation of USC and PRSI&rdquo;, published in September 2018, remain valid in the context of an amalgamation of USC and Income Tax. </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to carry out any further analysis on the proposal suggested by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the world, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution. Our redistributive tax system has been acknowledged by the IMF, the OECD and the ESRI. In my view, a broad-based, progressive income tax system, where the majority of income earners make some contribution but according to their means, is the most fair and sustainable income tax system in the long term.</p></reply>

As of September 2021, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;387 million, an increase of 19% year-on-year.  </p><p>Credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). I am pleased to share with the Deputy that three credit union backed funds have received approval from the Central Bank. Credit unions will be able to invest up to &euro;900 million in these regulated funds, which will subsequently lend to AHBs. </p><p>SME Lending </p><p>Nineteen credit unions were approved in early 2021 for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Further, in November five credit unions were announced as participants in the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme (BILS). The BILS provides low-cost loans of &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m to eligible Brexit-impacted businesses. </p><p>In total, SME lending has grown 6.9% year on year to end September 2021.  Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book. </p><p>Access to Finance for Retrofit </p><p>The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit. My officials have been engaging with stakeholders to support increased credit union participation in retrofit loan schemes.  </p><p>Other Services</p><p>Other than member savings and lending, in order to provide &ldquo;additional services&rdquo;, a credit union must receive approval from the Central Bank.  </p><p>66 credit unions are approved to provide current accounts.  </p><p>The Central Bank has prescribed a list of exempt services which may be provided without requiring approval. The Central Bank is undertaking a review of the Exempt Services Schedule to ensure that the services listed reflect the current financial services landscape. The Central Bank has commenced a public consultation seeking views from stakeholders on the proposed changes arising from this review.</p></reply>

It is not possible to definitively confirm the number of PAYE taxpayers who have yet to file their returns for 2021 as in many cases they pay the correct tax throughout the year and are not required to file a return, unless there are additional credits or reliefs to which they are entitled and wish to claim. Over 99% of the tax returns filed to date were received through the online channels with any refunds due paid within three to five working days.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has answered 110,000 calls to the PAYE Helpline so far in 2022. These calls related to a broad range of issues including requests for assistance with completing the income tax return (online and paper), clarifying tax entitlements for the current year (2022) and requesting changes to individual taxpayer records. Revenue has also dealt with over 3,400 requests for paper forms through its Forms and Leaflets Ordering Service to date in 2022 and processed almost 1,350 paper PAYE returns subsequently received. </p>  <p>  Regarding Question 9751-22, Revenue has confirmed that it already provides instructional videos to assist taxpayers using Revenue&rsquo;s online facilities.

Of course, the recovery has not been uniform across service sub-sectors and activity remains below the pre-pandemic level in the majority of these sectors, with the exception of ICT and Wholesale and Retail Trade.  Indeed the recovery in these services sub-sectors stalled somewhat towards the end of last year during the height of the Omicron wave.</p>  <p>  On the other hand, &lsquo;knowledge-intensive&rsquo; sectors proved more resilient. For this reason the &lsquo;&rsquo;modern manufacturing sector&rsquo;&rsquo; which is dominated by pharmaceutical and other MNEs performed strongly throughout the Pandemic. Perhaps more importantly, production in the &lsquo;&rsquo;traditional sector&rsquo;&rsquo; is performing solidly having grown by over 5 per cent in the final quarter of 2021 compared to the previous three months. </p>  <p>  Looking ahead, a range of business surveys suggest a continuing strong rate of growth in both the manufacturing and services sectors, as both international and domestic demand recovers. The lifting of many of the remaining domestic restrictions in January this year is an important tailwind for the services sector. My Department will continue to closely monitor and analyse these developments and will publish updated economic forecasts as part of the Stability Programme Update in April.</p></reply>

However, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages, nor can other EU counterparts.   </p>  <p>  Despite this, it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland. For example, the interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.69% in December 2021.   </p>  <p>  The weighted average interest rate on new fixed rate mortgage agreements stood at 2.59% in December 2021, down from a series high of 4.11% in December 2014. There has also been a reduction in the interest rates charged on loans to SMEs and consumers over the same period.</p>  <p>  However, Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include for example operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect: </p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience; </p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks); and</p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income ratios which has been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years.  </p>  <p>  To conclude I appreciate that greater sustainable competition in the credit market will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers.  Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will consider how the banking system can best support economic activity, assess competition and consumer choice in the market for banking services and consider options to further develop the mortgage market.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the 2% rate band ceiling for USC was also increased for 2022 in line with the increase in the national minimum wage to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate of &euro;10.20 to &euro;10.50 will remain outside the top rates of USC. Further details can be located at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/7e491-taxation-measures/.     </p>  <p>  Having regard to the fiscal demands and pressures facing the State in 2022, it was not possible to increase all tax credits and remain within the fiscal parameters. However, the tax changes introduced in Budget 2022, will benefit all income earners who pay income tax, including those persons in receipt of the Single Person Child Carer Credit, and are aimed at helping taxpayers at a time when prices are rising.   I would also note that those in receipt of this credit may also have entitlement to an increased standard rate band each year which is &euro;4,000 higher than that which applies to a single person who is not entitled to the credit.</p>  <p>  In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Single Person Child Carer Credit in its current form is appropriately calibrated at present and there are no immediate plans to review or amend the relief.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-22a.692.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022200065#WRO02800"><p>The Government have stated on many occasions that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  In relation to EWSS the scheme was introduced to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.  </p>  <p>  In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (17 February) by EWSS is just over  &euro;7.46 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of &euro;6.45  billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;1.01 billion to 51,900 employers in respect of over 715,300 employees. </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the scheme, the EWSS has been under active consideration and review in terms of its responsiveness, cost and impact. As part of Budget 2022, the Government agreed the future of EWSS including its graduated exit strategy. Since then, consistent monitoring of the scheme continued and the scheme was subsequently enhanced in response to the public health situation, namely the extension of the enhanced rates of subsidy for a further two months (across December 2021 and January 2022) and the reopening of the scheme for certain businesses as announced on 9 and 21 December 2021 respectively.</p>  <p>  From 1 February 2022, for most businesses, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022. </p>  <p>  Following a further assessment, I announced on 21 January 2022, that businesses availing of EWSS that were directly impacted by the public health regulations of last December, would continue to receive the enhanced rates of subsidy for the month of February and the graduated step-down in subsidy rates would be delayed by one month with such firms continuing to receive support under the scheme until 31 May 2022.    </p>  <p>  Turning to CRSS, the scheme was introduced as a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The CRSS was extended to 31 January 2022 in the Finance Act 2021.   </p>  <p>  The scheme was available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits of which are chargeable to tax under Case 1 of Schedule D, from a business premises that is subject to restrictions, set out in the relevant legislation, that prohibit or considerably restrict customer access. The legislation requires that a claim must be made no later than eight weeks from the date on which the &lsquo;claim period&rsquo; commences.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, from 20 December 2021, the Government introduced certain restrictive measures for businesses within the hospitality and indoor entertainment sectors. Following the announcement of these restrictions, the CRSS was reviewed with a view to expanding the supports available to businesses during the period of restrictions. Businesses operating within these sectors, who would ordinarily operate evening and night-time trading hours, were considered to be significantly restricted from operating for the purposes of the CRSS and were eligible for support under the scheme where they meet the eligibility conditions.  The Government also agreed that the turnover reduction criteria will be increased from no more that 25% of 2019 turnover to no more that 40% of 2019 turnover, and that new businesses established between 13 October 2020 to 26 July 2021 would be eligible to apply for the scheme. To date a total of 25,600 unique premises have claimed payments under the scheme amounting to &euro;727 million.  </p>  <p>  It is my intention that the legislative aspects associated with the revised arrangements for CRSS and EWSS, outlined above, will be addressed by primary legislation in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the Revenue Commissioners are operating the revised arrangements on an administrative basis pending the legislation.  </p>  <p>  Finally, work is underway at senior official level on an inter-departmental basis to review the experience from the introduction and operation of Covid-19 emergency income supports paid to/in respect of people whose employment was impacted due to public health restrictions, and to identify lessons learnt.  My Department is represented on the relevant group which is chaired by the Department of Social Protection and also includes representatives from the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Enterprise Trade and Employment and from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Where a complaint closes in Registration and Assessment or in Legal Services, these complaints have been subject to an in-depth assessment. </p><p>Complaints that close in Registration and Assessment will be closed for a number of reasons. In 2020, 465 complaints were closed because they were found to be ineligible. This was mainly because these complaints were related to products, services, or service providers that do not fall within the remit of the FSPO, not enough information was provided by the complainant to proceed, the complaint was appropriate for another Ombudsman, or the complaint was deemed withdrawn because the complainant did not engage in any further communication. </p><p>There were 327 files closed following a detailed Early Jurisdictional Assessment service, where these complaints fell outside the remit of the FSPO due to jurisdictional issues. These included complaints that do not meet the time limits for bringing a complaint to the FSPO, where the complaint has been, or is the subject of legal proceedings, where fraud has been alleged or where the complaint is more suitably dealt with by a different forum. </p><p>Complaints will also be closed in Registration and Assessment when the FSPO engages directly with the financial service provider or pension provider, in order to secure a final response to the complaint for the consumer. This allows the complaint to close if the complainants are satisfied with their provider&rsquo;s final response.</p><p>Where an issue arises, which requires a more detailed legal assessment, the matter is referred to the Legal Services Unit for a formal jurisdictional assessment to determine whether the complaint, or elements of the complaint, can proceed to investigation. The FSPO makes every effort to assist the parties in understanding the extent and limits of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s jurisdiction. The parties to the complaint will be invited to make submissions during the assessment process, before the final determination on jurisdiction is ultimately confirmed to the parties. 536 complaints were closed following this detailed legal assessment. The total number of complaints closed during 2020 was 6,193 which occurred at various stages of the complaint management lifecycle, as detailed below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Registration and Assessment</th>       <th>1,401</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dispute Resolution Service</td>       <td>2,960</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Investigation Service</td>       <td>735</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Legal Service</td>       <td>536</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>An additional 561 complaints that were ineligible were closed in 2020.

Any jurisdictional determination, including in relation to time limits, is made by the Ombudsman on the basis of an in-depth assessment of the evidence available regarding the complaint, to ensure that the provisions of the Act are observed. The Ombudsman must at all times act within the limits of the governing legislation. </p><p>In July 2017, legislative changes were made to the time limits for making complaints to the FSPO&rsquo;s predecessor, the Financial Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s Bureau. This introduced additional time limits for complaints about the conduct of financial service providers, in respect of a &ldquo;long-term financial service&quot;. These expanded time limits were included in the Act, which commenced in January 2018, when the FSPO came into existence. </p><p>Section 51 of the Act, governing time limits, prescribes that any complaint about a &quot;long-term financial service&quot;, can be made not only within a period of six years of the date of the conduct complained of, but also within a period of three years of a certain &quot;date of knowledge&quot; as prescribed within the Act. In addition, the Ombudsman has a statutory discretion, regarding such complaints, to extend the time where there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and it would be just and equitable in all the circumstances to do so. </p><p>Section 2 of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017 originally prescribed that a &ldquo;long-term financial service&rdquo; essentially constituted: </p><p>(a) a product or service with a fixed term of 5 years and 1 month or more, or </p><p>(b) life assurance. </p><p>The definition of long term financial service was further refined in 2018 to ensure greater protections for consumers, such that the definition now includes the following provision:- </p><p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the fact that the financial service does not fix its duration to be of a term such as is referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of &lsquo;long-term financial service&rsquo; in subsection (1), a financial service shall be regarded as falling within that definition if it would be reasonable for a consumer to expect its duration to be of at least the length referred to in that paragraph and that reasonable expectation arises by reason of&mdash; </p><p>(a) the manner in which the financial service operates to provide a financial benefit to the consumer, </p><p>(b) the type of assets with which its operation is connected, or </p><p>(c) representations made by the financial service provider, as distinct from where such an expectation arises in the case of</p><p>(i) a current account with a financial institution, or </p><p>(ii) any other financial service of an indefinite duration that is widely available and does not possess specialised characteristics.&rdquo;</p></reply>

These services, which include an online communications channel through the MyEnquiries system, are available 24/7, are easy to use and are fully secure.</p>  <p>  For customers that are not comfortable with its online services, Revenue provides an extensive telephone service, which has continued to operate since the early stages of the pandemic. The full list of telephone services and their opening hours are available on the Revenue website. Revenue also continues to operate a full service for queries being received through the postal system.</p>  <p>  Regarding situations where more complex tax issues exist that require direct engagement, Revenue provides a one to one appointment service with the relevant official. These engagements can be carried out remotely by video conferencing. Such an appointment can be arranged by contacting 01- 738 3660 from 09.30 to 13.30 (Monday to Friday).</p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has confirmed that the timelines around reopening public offices are kept under continuous review.

However, I have been advised by it as follows:</p>  <p>  Revenue's process for taxing DSP payments, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) seeks to cater for the different scenarios that can arise across the PAYE case base. </p>  <p>  Following significant consideration by Revenue, the basis of taxation adopted aims, as far as possible, to collect the right amount of tax at the right time while avoiding an accumulation of liabilities at year-end in as many of the different scenarios as possible. While the option proposed has merit in some less complex cases, (like in the worked examples provided in the details supplied with the question), it could lead to significant hardship in many cases, particularly where credits were allocated other than 50/50 between jointly assessed couples.  </p>  <p>  For example, married couples who are jointly assessed may choose to alter &lsquo;the split&rsquo; in the tax credits they jointly share. In such circumstances, where one or both was on the PUP, applying the process proposed could result in significant financial hardship where the allocated tax credits to one spouse or civil partner does not cover the tax due.</p>  <p>  By way of example, a jointly assessed couple may opt to have the married personal tax credit allocated to one partner for 2021 rather than split evenly. This would result in a scenario where one has tax credits of &euro;4,950 for the year (made up of the married personal tax credit of &euro;3,300 and the PAYE tax credit of &euro;1,650) while the other has the remaining PAYE tax credit of &euro;1,650. If the person on the lower tax credits was on the maximum rate of PUP, s/he could have a potential liability of &euro;995 after 26 weeks if those credits were allocated on a &lsquo;week 1&rsquo; basis.</p>  <p>  When a person who was in receipt of PUP payments returned to work in 2021, his or her tax credits and rate band were generally restored on a &lsquo;week 1 basis&rsquo;. This was to avoid any possible financial hardship that could arise from an increased tax liability for that pay period under the &lsquo;cumulative basis&rsquo;. However, a person who received the maximum rate of PUP could still have a tax liability at the end of the year because the tax due exceeded his or her available tax credits.</p>  <p>  For a person who received less than the maximum weekly rate of PUP, his or her tax credits may have exceeded the tax due by between &euro;3.46 and &euro;22.86 (depending on which PUP rate applied). In such circumstances it was more beneficial to the person that his or her tax credits were restored on the &lsquo;cumulative basis&rsquo; rather than the &lsquo;week 1&rsquo; basis, thereby ensuring that any over-deducted tax was refunded through salary. </p>  <p>  In some instances where a person returned to work, the final PUP payment (paid in arrears) overlapped with the first salary payment resulting in an overpayment of tax for that period because the necessary adjustments to the tax credits had not taken place. For a person on the maximum rate of PUP, the additional tax deducted minimised his or her liability at year end, while for employees on the lower rates of PUP, the additional tax deducted was refunded once their credits were restored to the &lsquo;cumulative basis&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Revenue has assured me that taxpayers that were placed on a &lsquo;week one&rsquo; basis can opt to be switched back to the &lsquo;cumulative basis&rsquo; where it is advantageous for them to do so.  A very sizeable proportion of PUP recipients chose this option in 2021 and where an overpayment existed, it was repaid to them through their salary. </p>  <p>  When the Income Tax Return for 2021 is submitted after year end and there is an overpayment of tax in the year but there is an outstanding liability for other years, the refund due is firstly offset against the outstanding amounts before any remaining balance is repaid. This is the normal practice and applies to 2021 as it does for any other year.</p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue has assured me that it is constantly seeking to ensure that its processes do not disadvantage taxpayers and that it stays as close as possible to the principle that people should pay the right tax at the right time.  </p></reply>

This is a similar system to that operated in the majority of OECD countries and means that contributions to pensions are exempted from income tax (subject to age-related percentage and income limitations), pension fund gains are exempted from income tax but income from pension drawdown is taxed.</p>  <p>  Overall, the policy objective for tax relief on pension contributions is to encourage individuals to save for retirement, to meet a target level of supplementary pension coverage and an income replacement target, and to assist in preventing an over reliance of State support for people in later life.</p>  <p>  In my view, we should seek to make overall progress in the area of pension provision in a manner that is comprehensive and surefooted.  That broad approach is what has informed recent action in this area including the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 which, in turn, led to the work of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group and the separate work of the Pensions Commission. Indeed, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare has also been charged with considering the output from the Pensions Commission regarding sustainability and eligibility issues in respect of State Pension arrangements.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, the performance of private pension funds is primarily a commercial matter and contingent on market circumstances and external factors.</p>  <p>  As regards the pension fund levy, this levy was introduced in 2011 in the wake of the financial crash and at a time when the economy was in serious difficulties. Something had to be done to preserve and boost jobs and it is an unavoidable fact that difficult economic situations require hard and very often unpopular decisions. All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years.</p>  <p>  The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. The levy was successful and did its job as reflected in the increased activity and employment in that sector.</p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levies have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to support the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers who may have ultimately borne the impact of the levy will have since benefitted from tax reductions in the last number of Budgets, including the substantial income tax package announced as part of Budget 2022.</p></reply>

It is for this reason that Ireland has not introduced any new VAT refund orders since the 1980&rsquo;s and any changes to VAT refunds since then have been either by EU requirement or making minor changes to existing orders.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Government is committed to the delivery of a National Retrofit Plan, approving a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills. The measures address barriers to undertaking energy upgrades (retrofits) reported by homeowners and those working in the industry.</p>  <p>  The changes represent an important step in delivery of the National Retrofit Plan, which identifies a range of measures aimed at driving demand for retrofit, expanding the size and capacity of the supply chain, as well as making retrofits more affordable.</p></reply>

It also represents a 13 per cent increase compared with November 2021. Separately BPFI data indicates that in overall terms, almost &euro;10.5bn in new mortgage lending was drawn down in 2021, the highest level of annual lending since 2008.  More than half of this lending was drawn down by first time buyers. </p>  <p>  More generally, there is also an increasing range of diversity of mortgage products now available to consumers, with different mortgage lenders seeking to focus on or be more competitive in a particular part of the market.  Also new entrants have recently come into the market and a number of lenders now offer very long term fixed mortgage interest rate products to consumers. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, some lenders are offering &ldquo;green&rdquo; mortgages at competitive rates to customers who intend to apply for a mortgage to buy a property with a high energy efficient rating or to improve a property by bringing it up to a high energy efficient rating.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the general level of new lending interest rates in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries. However, the price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders.  Despite this, it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland. For example, the interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.69% in December 2021.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that caution should be used in making direct comparisons, given that cash back offers and mortgage fees are features of some markets, and will alter the overall cost of credit for a mortgage borrower relative to that reported in interest rate statistics.</p>  <p>  Irish mortgage and other loans can have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  There are also a number of important factors which will likely influence the interest rates charged on Irish mortgages. These include for example operational costs, certain structural factors as referenced above (such as incentives offered), as well as the fact that pricing will reflect:</p>  <p>  - credit risk and capital requirements which in Ireland are elevated due to historical loss experience;</p>  <p>  - the level of non-performing loans which is higher in Ireland relative to other European banks (as provisioning and capital requirements are higher for these loans to reflect their higher risk and this in turn results in higher credit and capital costs for the Irish banks); and</p>  <p>  - higher cost-to-income ratios which has been a characteristic of the Irish banking sector in recent years.</p>  <p>  In relation to the availability of mortgages, while competition issues generally are primarily a matter for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, competitive pressures in the banking sector can clearly have an effect on the functioning of the financial system and the on the quality and price of credit and other banking services provided to customers.</p>  <p>  The Irish retail banking system is relatively concentrated by international standards and the recent decisions by some banks to leave the Irish market will further impact on this. However, against this as noted above some new lenders have entered the market and are playing a greater role in the provision of new mortgage lending. Even in a concentrated banking system such as that in place in recent years, price competition is possible, particularly in a growing economy and trends show that interest rates in Ireland have been falling in recent years, providing benefit to consumers. </p>  <p>  However, I fully appreciate that enhanced sustainable competition in the credit and banking market more generally will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers.  Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will assess various aspects of the banking market and will consider options to encourage greater competition in the credit and banking market, including possible options to develop the mortgage market.</p></reply>

This was largely driven by energy inflation, which increased by an estimated 29 per cent. Pandemic-related effects, such as the impact of temporary VAT reductions, and technical factors, such as measurement issues, added further volatility.  Core inflation &ndash; which strips out energy and non-processed food inflation &ndash; was 2.5 per cent in January.</p>  <p>  HICP inflation moderated slightly from 5.7 per cent to 5.0 per cent in Ireland in the same period.</p>  <p>  The latest figures point to inflation, including energy prices, remaining high over the near-term, before gradually easing later this year. The ECB projects inflation to average 3.2 per cent this year but to decline to rates of 1.8 per cent in both 2023 and 2024.  Both the Commission and the ECB are confident that elevated inflation is largely linked to temporary factors, including supply-side constraints and the recovery in demand as our economies reopen.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the ECB is an independent institution with a mandate to maintain price stability, defined as around 2 per cent over the medium-term. The ECB currently expects inflation to fall slightly below 2 per cent by end-2022.</p>  <p>  That said, energy prices can entail wide-ranging consequences for inflation and raise costs for businesses and families. In recognition of these potential social impacts, many Member States have introduced targeted measures to protect vulnerable households from energy poverty.</p>  <p>  Ireland is one of these Member States.  In framing Budget 2022, I was conscious of these cost of living pressures and announced a range of measures including targeted social welfare initiatives. Last week, Minister McGrath and I announced a suite of further supports to aid households and to target the main underlying problem &ndash; higher energy prices. This is in addition to the electricity credit for households announced late last year.</p>  <p>  In addition, at an EU level, the Commission has issued a Communication on Tackling Rising Energy Prices, and the matter was discussed at various Council configurations. The Communication emphasises the broad nature of the impact and policy response.</p>  <p>  In short, my fellow Finance Ministers and I all agree that this is an important issue and that we need to continue closely monitoring inflation and energy price developments and the potential implications for our economies.</p></reply>

According to the most recent figures released by the Central Statistics Office, the national Residential Property Price Index increased by 14.4 per cent in the year to December 2021. The price of new homes also increased by 5.1 per cent between Q4 2020 and Q4 2021.</p>  <p>  The "going price" of a house is determined by the cost of construction and the dynamics of housing demand and supply. The high levels of property price inflation seen recently are likely a reflection of an undersupply of homes in the market and the release of savings built up during public health restrictions.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary response to mitigating residential price inflation is to increase supply. Recent data give encouragement that the target for delivery of new homes for 2022 under Housing for All will be met and very likely exceeded. During 2021, over 30,700 new homes were commenced, the highest since 2008. In addition, planning permission was granted for the construction of 39,077 new units in the 12 months to end-September 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition to increasing the supply of homes in general, more work needs to be done to increase the supply of social and affordable homes. In Budget 2022, &euro;4 billion was allocated towards housing, including capital funding of &euro;2.58 billion, a large element of which will be used to deliver 9,200 new social homes. The vast bulk of this will be delivered through new-build, with a limited, targeted acquisition programme.</p>  <p>  Housing for All also targets the delivery of 54,000 affordable homes for purchase or rent and over 90,000 social homes by 2030, which will make a real difference in improving affordability for our citizens.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I also extended the Help to Buy scheme which is a key support for first-time buyers who wish to purchase a new home.</p>  <p>  All of these measures testify to the need to take a multi-faceted approach to increase the supply of new housing and I will continue to work closely with my Government colleagues to ensure these targets are delivered.</p></reply>

While the annual rate of inflation moderated to 5 per cent in January, this reflects seasonal patterns, including post-Christmas sales rather than an easing of inflation more generally. Almost every advanced country in the world is in the same position, with the inflation rate reaching a record high of 5.1 per cent in the euro area in January.</p>  <p>  Both domestic and external factors can explain this uptick in inflation. On the external front, the rise in wholesale energy prices is the key contributor and reflects the rapid rebound in global demand. Global supply chain disruptions including the availability of inputs, including timber and semi-conductors, and transport bottlenecks have also added to inflationary pressures.</p>  <p>  Domestically, the speed and strength of the economic recovery has led to a mismatch between demand and supply and put upward pressure on prices. Brexit and the reversal of the temporary VAT cut since September are likely to have been additional factors, with regulations affecting the minimum price of alcohol contributing to inflation in January.</p>  <p>  At the time of Budget 2022, my Department forecast headline inflation of 2&frac14; per cent for this year. Due to energy price spikes since the Budget, there will be some upside to this projection, with inflation of around 4 per cent or more based on current energy price projections now more likely. Nevertheless, inflation is expected to ease over the course of this year as some of the temporary drivers fade, demand stabilises and supply catches up. Updated projections will be published with the Stability Programme Update in April.</p>  <p>  However, the possibility that these price dynamics prove more persistent cannot be ruled out, with the likelihood of second round effects increasing the longer this period of high inflation lasts. The higher inflation environment has brought about an earlier than expected shift in monetary policy. In the euro area, market participants are now pricing in two interest rate increases this year; these come on top of the ending of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme next month. The net effect of this monetary policy shift is expected to be higher sovereign borrowing costs. In light of these risks, my Department will continue to closely monitor inflation over the coming months.</p></reply>

I am informed that international organisations, such as the OECD and Eurostat, do not publish comparative data on the cost of insurance between countries. Eurostat publishes Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data with regard to insurance, but this only provides a comparison of the rate of inflation for different types of insurance such as motor and travel insurance. Accordingly, it is not possible to compare the underlying cost of each insurance type. In addition, this does not include a comparative index for the price of insurance to businesses. In any event, any international comparisons based on price alone would not take into account relevant factors such as the various regulatory environments and liability systems in place in different jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  However, increased availability of data in relation to insurance, and understanding the factors that influence insurance costs, is important. In this regard, the National Claims Information Database (NCID) is unique in Europe in terms of the transparency it provides into the Irish insurance sector. To date, the Central Bank has published NCID reports on private motor insurance and employers&rsquo; liability, public liability and commercial property insurance. These contain a wealth of information regarding the key insurance markets for consumers and businesses, including data on claims costs and average earned premiums.</p>  <p>  The NCID is continually looking to improve the transparency and insight that can be provided through these reports, and each data collection has been amended to include more information. As such, I believe that it will continue to serve a vital role in helping us to understand the impact of market developments on insurance costs into the future. In addition, over time the NCID should enable stakeholders to assess the impact of the wide range of Government reforms already undertaken to improve the affordability of insurance, and will enable us to better-tailor any future measures to increase the competitiveness of this sector.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that according to the latest CSO Consumer Price Index for January 2022, the price of motor insurance decreased by a further 9.3 per cent year-on-year. This is especially of note in light of the 5 per cent rise in the general price level over the corresponding period. As such, it is my hope that consistent implementation of measures under the current reform agenda will help to maintain this downward trend, while also improving the affordability of other types of insurance for businesses, community and voluntary groups.</p></reply>

My Department, the Central Bank and the NTMA continue to monitor developments and activities in the financial sector in accordance with their respective responsibilities.</p>  <p>  The nature, scale and complexity of Ireland&rsquo;s international financial services sector is changing in a number of ways as a result of firms relocating within the single market, and the sector is broader and more diverse with more firms carrying out a greater range of regulated activities than at any time.

The most recent data for modified domestic demand &ndash; the best measure of domestic economic activity &ndash; showed continued growth, with domestic activity surpassing its pre-pandemic level. While the domestic economy is rapidly bouncing back, external trade has bolstered the Irish economy throughout the crisis.</p>  <p>  The exports of the multinational sector in Ireland proved highly resilient during the pandemic, and MNCs supported the Irish economy via employment and taxes. Importantly this growth is now becoming more broadly balanced with the indigenous traded sector rebounding strongly last year. The economies of our major trading partners, including the EU, are also recovering, creating a supportive external environment for Ireland&rsquo;s trade going forward.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the contribution Ireland&rsquo;s exports make to the economy, and the need to maintain our competitive advantage on the international stage. The Irish modified current account, which strips out the distorting effects of globalisation, is also in a very strong position and is expected to remain in surplus over the medium term. The 2021 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Ireland as the 6th most competitive country in the EU and the 13th most competitive country in the world.</p>  <p>  The strong recovery in the economy has helped drive the recovery in the labour market, with 2.5 million now in employment and the Covid-19 adjusted unemployment rate falling from a peak of 31.5 per cent in April 2020 to 7.8 per cent in January 2022.</p>  <p>  Against this positive economic backdrop we cannot become complacent and we must remain cognisant of the challenges to our competitiveness both now and into the future. As the economy approaches full employment, wage pressures are likely to emerge which could in turn feed through to persistent inflationary pressure. Indeed, shortages are already emerging in certain sectors.</p>  <p>  The international outlook remains a source of continued uncertainty and I am acutely aware of the risks this poses. There is expected to be a negative implication for Irish trade once the UK fully implements the trade provisions of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. Beyond Brexit, Ireland, as a small open economy, remains particularly exposed to global risks, including a worsening in the epidemiological situation, persistent supply side bottlenecks, energy price shocks, global inflationary pressure and rising geopolitical tension. My Department will continue to monitor the risks to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness closely, and this Government will respond to them as required to protect and promote the Irish economy.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery has been remarkable, and both the domestic economy and our external environment have improved markedly since the onset of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Over the course of the crisis, Ireland&rsquo;s FDI base has shown incredible resilience. Inward FDI flows to Ireland amounted to almost a fifth of GDP in 2020, placing Ireland&rsquo;s inward flows as the second highest in the EU, according to the OECD. The IDA results for 2021 suggest that FDI in Ireland remains strong, with the highest increase in FDI employment in a single year recorded.</p>  <p>  The competitiveness of the Irish economy is internationally recognised. The 2021 IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Ireland as the 6th most competitive country in the EU and the 13th most competitive country in the world. This provides a strong foundation on which Ireland can build in coming years.</p>  <p>  With the economic recovery progressing rapidly, FDI investment will play a crucial role in helping ensure a strong and sustainable economy going forward. Despite the disruption to the global FDI landscape caused by the pandemic, Ireland remains an attractive location for foreign direct investment. Foreign companies continue to recognise and value Ireland&rsquo;s unique competitive advantages, namely our track record as an innovative and stable home to global business, our talented and flexible workforce, and our hard-won reputation as a pro-enterprise jurisdiction.</p></reply>

Reflecting this approach, the Government allowed public indebtedness to rise over the last two years in order to mitigate the economic fallout of the pandemic. This was the appropriate counter-cyclical strategy, with budgetary supports helping to cushion the negative economic impact of the necessary public health restrictions. In turn, the prudent management of the public finances in the years preceding the pandemic helped build the budgetary space to allow such an approach. However, as we look beyond the pandemic, we need to once again balance the books over the economic cycle and put the debt ratio on a downward path, in order to maintain the sustainability of the public finances in the future.</p>  <p>  To this end, in last year&rsquo;s Summer Economic Statement, the Government set out a pathway consistent with investing in our economy and society while, at the same time, reducing the budgetary deficit over time. Our medium-term budgetary strategy is now anchored to an expenditure rule. Under this rule core expenditure growth, that is, excluding Covid-related expenditure, is fixed at just over 5 per cent per year. This is in line with the economy&rsquo;s estimated trend growth rate and will allow significant investment while at the same time stabilising the public finances.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the public finances out-performed our expectations last year with a deficit of around 4 per cent of GNI* recorded, around half the level we expected it would be last spring.  Most of this improvement was due to better than forecast revenue receipts, and the directing of this additional revenue to deficit reduction. A continuation of this prudent approach coupled with the phased exiting of Covid-related supports, will mean that the economic recovery will help restore balance to the fiscal accounts over the short-term. In addition, the Department&rsquo;s medium-term economic projections envisage a return to reasonably strong economic growth in the coming years.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are a number of medium-to-long-term fiscal challenges already identifiable on the horizon. Amongst these are the challenges to the public finances posed by the so-called &lsquo;dual transitions&rsquo; to a digital and green economy, as well as the expected ageing of the population over the coming decades. The window of opportunity to address these challenges is rapidly closing. Policy intervention will be require to mitigate the inevitable implications of ageing demographics, and the dual transitions, otherwise we risk putting the public finances on an unsustainable trajectory over the medium-to-long-term. At the same time, our revenue streams will be affected by the possibility of lower corporation tax receipts. </p></reply>

As one of the most affected Member States, I pay particular attention to the effective implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) and to the Withdrawal Agreement, which includes the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Across the EU, solidarity with Ireland in respect of Brexit remains steadfast. The Member States support the Commission's approach in engaging and responding to genuine concerns from people and businesses in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is also important that we continue to prepare for any unforeseen consequences over the coming period. The Government remains focused on protecting our economic and financial interests, and will continue to work to minimise the disruption that Brexit will have on the economy and peoples&rsquo; livelihood to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  The Government has dedicated substantial resources to preparing for Brexit and the systems in place are working well. We have invested significantly in new infrastructure, systems and staff, and continue to engage intensively with stakeholders and to provide a range of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for impacted sectors and businesses.</p>  <p>  Ireland will be the largest beneficiary from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR), the aim of which is to provide financial support to the most affected Member States, regions and sectors to deal with the adverse consequences of Brexit. Ireland is to receive &euro;1.165 billion from the BAR, and the payment of the first tranche of &euro;361.5 million was received in mid-December 2021. Funding will be directed at areas such as enterprise supports; supports for the agri-food and fisheries sectors, reskilling and retraining; and checks and controls at our ports and airports.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions they apply in those policies, nor can I direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that there is no standard approach from insurers when it comes to offering quotations on the open market. Insurers rely on their individual risk and underwriting criteria, and they review such scenarios on a case-by-case basis. It is understood from Insurance Ireland that, generally speaking, if a claim is pending/outstanding, regardless of fault, there is a reluctance from prospective insurers in the market to provide a quotation. In general terms this means that the consumer will stay with their incumbent insurer until the claim is settled.</p>  <p>  According to Insurance Ireland, one of the reasons for this is that getting up-to-date information on the status of the open claim can be challenging, as there is no definite length of time to settle an insurance claim, especially with regard to personal injury claims. Furthermore the potential claim settlement amount could be outside the individual insurers risk acceptance criteria. Insurance Ireland has advised that there are usually specialist brokers in the market who may source capacity for consumers with open or pending claims, but the nature of the premium is often higher to reflect the risk.</p>  <p>  Finally, it may interest the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover. This can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

The project was funded as a pathfinder initiative in the area of data analytics on the non-profit sector. Benefacts was initially co-funded with philanthropy, however in recent years the Department has been providing the majority of funding to the entity.</p>  <p>  In 2019, DPER received an independent report which it commissioned to provide analysis of the market for data on the non-profit sector. This report examined, inter alia, issues around the demand for the data concerned; methodologies and technologies used; the potential for direct provision by the State of these services itself, and; the maturity of the market to provide these services efficiently. On foot of this report, DPER undertook a review in 2020 which found that the business case for its continued funding of Benefacts was no longer justified and accordingly the decision was made to terminate funding. This decision was notified to the Chairperson of the Board of Benefacts and other relevant stakeholders from June 2020.</p>  <p>  Recognising that other public service bodies with direct policy involvement in the not-for-profit sector may have wished to consider whether they had an appreciable business case to continue funding Benefacts, my Department agreed to fund the initiative up to the end of 2021. This provision was made to facilitate relevant public service bodies to consider their position and to assess all of the options in relation to their respective business needs concerning data on the not-for-profit sector. </p>  <p>  In April 2021, my Department reaffirmed its 2020 decision to all of the parties concerned. Furthermore, in acknowledgment of the impact of Covid19 on this deliberative process, DPER sanctioned a final three month extension of funding to Benefacts up to the 31st March 2022.  As of February 2022, no department or agency has identified a significant business need to continue to avail of and provide funding to the service. </p>  <p>  The factors influencing the original decision from 2020  have not changed materially and, consequently, the decision of this Department to terminate funding remains unaltered. </p>  <p>  My officials are continuing to work closely with the staff and Board of Benefacts to ensure that all necessary requirements under the funding agreement will be met, including those which may arise under a wind-up scenario.</p></reply>

The Civil Service currently operates a 3 year carryover rule in relation to accrued annual leave. Under this rule, any untaken statutory leave may be carried forward from Year 1 to Year 2 with the employees consent and taken within the first six months of Year 2. Any untaken leave that exceeds the statutory minimum allowance (4 working weeks) may be carried forward from Cycle Year 1 to Cycle Year 2. </p>  <p>  Staff who are in Cycle year 2 can carry over any untaken statutory leave from Year 2 to Year 3 with the employees consent and taken within the first six months of Year . Any untaken leave that exceeds the statutory minimum allowance (4 working weeks) may be carried forward from Cycle Year 2 to Cycle Year 3. </p>  <p>  For staff who are in Cycle year 3, carryover of annual leave at the end of the third year of the annual leave cycle is limited to the difference (if any) between the statutory minimum annual leave allowance (4 working weeks) and the officer&rsquo;s untaken annual leave in excess of the statutory minimum which has been accrued during the third year of the cycle only.  Any untaken leave over and above this difference will be forfeited.  </p>  <p>  Due to the unprecedented circumstances of the outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 and the various associated business challenges at the time, a special arrangement was put in place for officers to remain in their cycle year i.e. at March 31st 2020 (the end of the leave year) to allow additional time to avail of their annual leave during the 2020/21 annual leave year. For equity reasons, a similar &lsquo;roll back&rsquo; was applied to all staff in each of the different leave calendars (as certain civil service organisations have differing leave years). The associated issuing of communications and system updates for these 'roll backs' were processed by the National Shared Services Office (NSSO).</p>  <p>  In 2021, a second roll back was implemented for all staff to allow more time for those in cycle year 3 to use the build up of annual leave that had been created in the system and also for clear advance notice to be given that there was no intention of any further rollbacks. </p>  <p>  The NSSO issued a communication to all staff at the beginning of July 2021 to advise staff that it was not intended that there would be any further rolling back of the leave cycle years and advising all staff to discuss with their line managers how leave was to be used over the course of the year.   This communication also reinforced to all staff of the importance of taking annual leave for health and wellbeing purposes. </p>  <p>  In recent weeks, a reminder issued to all civil servants (of the previous communication that issued in July 2021), to advise staff who are in Leave Year 3 with outstanding leave to avail of, that they should discuss with their line managers how this is to be utilised. </p>  <p>  Further to this, in acknowledgement of the possibility that there may be staff who were not in a position to use their leave due to the business impact of the pandemic in some areas of the civil service during the past year, communications issued to all civil service employers and staff that on this occasion only, local flexibility may be provided where appropriate, outside of the NSSO system, to allow for  outstanding leave of those staff in cycle year 3 to be used beyond the end of the current annual leave year, in line with business requirements. </p></reply>

Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.1 billion.   The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.</p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the Programme closed for applications on 1 March 2021.  By this date, 3,106 applications had been submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.</p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were finalised and published prior to assessment work commencing and all applications were assessed in accordance with these procedures. The full scoring system and assessment procedures can be viewed at the following link: www.sportscapitalprogramme.ie/ and the final grant decisions were made in accordance with the scoring system.</p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on 6 August 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed. </p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the assessment process by the Sports Capital Division of my Department, a submission which included a spreadsheet setting out the final set of recommended grants was sent to Minister Martin and me on 10 February. As is the norm for grant announcements, the full set of approved grants was sent on the morning of 11 February to the Press Offices of the three Government parties in advance of the publication of all grants on the Gov.ie website later that day.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of all communications with regard to the SCEP, or any other official business for that matter, within and from my office is done through in person briefings and meetings, official Department email accounts and electronic submissions. Private email is not used in this regard and, while communication applications are used on occasion for reasons of expediency no sensitive material is circulated using such methods.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme is important to thousands of communities throughout the country and I receive regular representations on the Programme. I am always willing to engage with interested parties on the programme given its huge benefits for so many people, communities and clubs. These queries include contacts from Ministers, Ministers of States, Oireachtas members of all parties and their staff or advisers as well as other elected representatives and applicants. Where updates are sought on an application over the course of the round of the SCEP from Oireachtas members, staff or advisers, my office endeavours to provide the factual position at that point in time. </p>  <p>  An overall package of &euro;150 million in new capital grants under the 2020 round of the SCEP was announced on 11 February, a  record allocation under the programme. &euro;144 million was allocated to almost 1,900 applications with &euro;6 million kept in reserve for successful appeals lodged by unsuccessful applicants. The record allocation reflects the government&rsquo;s ongoing support to sport as the sector emerges from the challenges of the past two years. It reflects the funding challenges facing clubs across the country, the unprecedented number of applications received and the vital role that sport plays in supporting community and individual wellbeing, a role that came into sharp focus during the pandemic.</p></reply>

Any sports club can apply directly for funding up to a value of &euro;150,000 for local projects. In cases where a club does not own a premises, it is still permissible to apply for capital grants up to a value of &euro;50,000. A copy of the latest "Guide to Making an Application" which sets out the terms and conditions of the scheme is available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/service/d13385-sports-capital-programme/#introduction.</p>  <p>  The most recent round of the Programme closed for applications on 1 March 2021.  By this date, 3,106 applications had been submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received. </p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were finalised and published prior to assessment work commencing and all applications were assessed in accordance with these procedures. Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on 6 August 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over &euro;143.8m were announced on Friday 11 February 2022. The priority in the medium terms is to progress all of these projects to grant drawdown stage.</p>  <p>  In relation to any unsuccessful applicants, my Department will be in touch with relevant applicants shortly outlining the procedures which need to be followed to appeal the Department's decision. When the appeals process is complete, a full review of the 2020 round of the SCEP will be undertaken and any recommendations contained therein will be included in the terms and conditions of the next round.  The precise timing of this next round of the Programme will be announced once this review is complete. </p></reply>

Details of all applications made and grants awarded are published in tabular form on the Government's website and can be accessed at www.gov.ie/en/service/4113b3-large-scale-sport-infrastructure-fund-lssif/.</p>  <p>  Two grantees have commenced the implementation of their projects and to date a total of &euro;417,015 has been paid to those applicants. The remaining projects are at various stages of assessment with many at a stage where funding agreements are being finalised.</p>  <p>  While the priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects, as it is now two years since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced by grantees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was considered timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants. My Department has now met with all successful grantees and work is at an advanced stage in drafting the review. I expect this work to be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  Once that review is complete the scope for awarding any additional grants, adjusting the level  of existing grants and the timing of any new call for proposals will be considered.</p></reply>

The OPW is responsible for overseeing Ireland&rsquo;s approach to flood risk management across three strategic and policy areas, i.e. prevention, protection and preparedness.</p>  <p>   The 2004 report also acknowledged that the primary concern of my Department in relation to flooding, is to ensure that when adverse conditions arise, local authorities (including the fire services) are able to respond promptly and effectively to help offset the worst effects in relation to those aspects for which they have direct responsibility.</p>  <p>  There are three main flooding threats:</p>  <p>  -  Fluvial (river)</p>  <p>  -  Tidal</p>  <p>  -  Pluvial (rainfall)</p>  <p>  My Department is designated as the Lead Government Department for response to flooding with the Office of Public Works (OPW) having responsibility for flood prevention and mitigation. The National Directorate for Fire &amp;amp; Emergency Management (NDFEM) of my Department, working with Met &Eacute;ireann and OPW, monitor weather conditions on an on-going basis. NDFEM staff co-ordinate the response to flooding at national level, when required, supporting local authorities.   </p>  <p>  Local authorities are designated as a principal response agency as well as being 'lead agency' for coordinating the local response to flooding emergencies as per the Government decision relating to the &ldquo;Framework for Major Emergency Management&rdquo; (2006).  Local authorities prioritise life safety when responding to flooding emergencies. Protection of critical infrastructure, property and transport routes are also key objectives in any response to flooding.   </p>  <p>  My Department works with relevant stakeholders as appropriate, including Met &Eacute;ireann, OPW, local authorities, relevant Departments and ESB to ensure a co-ordinated response to each flooding event. This response mechanism has been evidenced in recent flooding events.</p>  <p>  Since 2009, my Department has made financial support, amounting to over &euro;94million available to assist local authorities in meeting the un-budgeted costs of clean-up and necessary immediate works, such as staff overtime and hire of plant and contractors, associated with significant severe weather emergency events, including flooding. This is in recognition of the exceptional nature of activities carried out by local authorities in responding to these types of emergencies and the fact that the costs of these un-programmed activities cannot be met from within existing resources.  This practice is considered a vital enabler of local authority response, providing the assurance that availability of resources is not a limiting factor in providing effective local response.</p>  <p>  The arrangements for emergency management have evolved and, when called upon, are seen as having worked well, in particular the responses to flooding and other severe weather emergencies led by local authorities. All local authorities have Severe Weather/ Flood Plans in place to support the response to weather emergencies as part of their individual Major Emergency Plans. Local authorities also have a Severe Weather Assessment Team in place, monitoring Met &Eacute;ireann weather warnings and OPW and EFAS flood advisory/ warnings and High Tide Advisories.</p>  <p>  My Department's Lead Government Department role includes the preparation of review reports into the response to flooding emergencies where national level coordination is activated. The most recent is the Review Report on Severe Weather Events 2017-2018, published in December 2019. The 2019 report was considered by the Government Task Force for Emergency Management.  My Department has implemented the recommendations relating to the Local Government sector fully.</p>  <p>  As outlined above, my Department&rsquo;s role in relation to flooding has been designated as coordinating the response when flooding does occur, with OPW as the lead organisation for flood risk management in Ireland.</p></reply>

These are the Historic Structures Fund (HSF) and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Community Monuments Fund (CMF).</p>  <p>  The HSF is for conservation and enhancement to heritage structures and historic buildings, in both private and public ownership, for the benefit of communities and the public. The BHIS is a scheme for the repair and conservation of structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures (RPS). It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small-scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals. The CMF is for investment in archaeological heritage and helps owners and custodians of archaeological monuments to safeguard them into the future for the benefit of communities and the public.</p>  <p>  On 5 November 2021, I launched the 2022 BHIS and HSF schemes which will have funding of &euro;8m - an increase of &euro;2 million from 2021. Full details of both schemes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website as well as on the websites of the local authorities; it should be noted, however, that the deadline for applications to the local authorities for the 2022 schemes has now passed. On 17 November 2021, I launched the 2022 CMF scheme with funding of &euro;5m &ndash; an increase of almost &euro;1m from that awarded in 2021. The deadline for applications to my Department from the local authorities for this scheme is 1 March 2022. It is intended to run all three schemes again in 2023 and full details will be available on my Department's website, and from the local authorities, from November onwards. An application in relation to the structure mentioned would be welcome.</p>  <p>  In the context of a particular building or historic structure, such as the boundary wall to the Church of Ireland in Glendalough, the best advice is generally to contact the Architectural Conservation Officer or Heritage Officer in the local authority who is very well placed to advise on the various types of funding available to assist with renovation. The relevant official in Wicklow County Council is Deirdre Burns, who can be contacted at (0404) 20100, dburns@wicklowcoco.ie.</p></reply>

These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing. </p>  <p>  The Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will support purchasers of Local Authority-delivered new homes by bridging the gap between the market value of the home and the combined value of the buyer's mortgage and deposit. Regulations to set out the detailed criteria are at an advanced stage and will be issued in the coming weeks. The first homes delivered through the scheme will be located in Cork City in the coming weeks. Cork City Council indicated the prices to be &euro;218,000 for a 2-bedroom and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling.  </p>  <p>  The First Home affordable purchase shared equity scheme, established under Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act, will act in a similar way to the Local Authority-led scheme, but will support purchases of newly constructed homes on the private market. This scheme will be available and in every county and will incorporate regional price caps based on median house price sales. Confirmation of the final details of this scheme is ongoing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders and it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will be available for applications from mid year. </p>  <p>  While affordable purchase measures are primarily targeted at first-time buyers to provide for new supply and concentrate supports in areas of highest need, the Housing for All strategy also provides for the &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle. Under the Fresh Start principle both affordable purchase schemes will be available to applicants who are divorced, legally separated or where the relationship has ended and where they retain no beneficial interest in a home. </p>  <p>  To further support affordability constrained households to purchase a home, the Local Authority Home Loan scheme commenced on 4 January 2022 and incorporates a lower interest rate, higher income eligibility thresholds, and more flexibility on house size. The Local Authority Home Loan is a Government backed mortgage scheme for those on modest or low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home. The loan can be used for new and second-hand properties, or for self-builds. Whilst targeted at First Time Buyers, the Local Authority Home Loan scheme  also applies the Fresh Start Principle. </p>  <p>  Importantly, affordable housing measures and schemes are designed to assist purchasers in meeting the costs of newly constructed homes and increasing the overall housing supply. By significantly increasing supply we will help temper inflationary pressures on the wider housing market which will benefit all home purchasers. </p>  <p>  Crucially, the CSO reported that housing completions amounted to 20,433 in 2021, a welcome increase over the 2015 reported levels of 7,219. The CSO also report that Commencement Notices for 30,724 new homes were issued in 2021, representing a 42% increase compared with 2020, or roughly the same as the combined reported totals from 2016 &amp;amp; 2017. While these reported figures represent a significant step forward in the Government&rsquo;s ambition to support the supply of new housing, it remains short of the 33,000 new dwellings annual target under Housing for All. This is why the Government has committed unprecedented levels of funding, averaging &euro;4 billion per year to improve the situation. </p>  <p>  Our multi-faceted approach to housing delivery will see greatly increased supply which we recognise is key to addressing inflationary pressures. Our measures will improve affordability for all families or individuals across society wishing to secure a home.</p></reply>

It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022 for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build. </p>  <p>  A &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle applies for applications to State loan schemes such the Local Authority Home Loan. The following categories of persons are eligible to apply for the Local Authority Home Loan under the Fresh Start principle:</p>  <p>  -  Applicant(s) that previously purchased or built a residential property, but is divorced and has left the property and divested themselves of their interest in the property are eligible. </p>  <p>  -  Applicant(s) that previously purchased a residential property, but have been divested of this through insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, are eligible to apply. The applicant must be discharged from bankruptcy proceedings. It should be noted that a return to solvency should not be interpreted as a return to creditworthiness, which is a separate assessment.</p>  <p>  In recognition of such instances, an exemption to the First Time Buyer eligibility criteria can be applied under the Fresh Start Principle. Therefore, once a person has exited insolvency/bankruptcy proceedings and if as a result of insolvency or bankruptcy they had to sell or had been divested of their home, they are eligible to apply for a Local Authority Home Loan. However, credit worthiness and repayment capacity must also be assessed as part of the underwriting process.</p>  <p>  The final decision regarding the Local Authority Home Loan application is made by the relevant Local Authority Credit Committee on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  Further details can be found on localauthorityhomeloan.ie/.</p></reply>

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural, to which specific conditions are attached. There is currently no planning exemption set out in the Regulations for the installation of solar panels on the roof of a school.  </p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for apartments and educational/community/religious buildings.  </p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, the regulations will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country with limited restriction zones around airports.  </p>  <p>  The draft regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. It is anticipated that the formal SEA process will commence, with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the completion of the screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit. The SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside the draft regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to commence shortly. A copy of the draft regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before the finalisation of the draft  regulations. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. It is intended that the process for finalising the solar panel planning exemptions will be completed in the coming months. </p>  <p>  While these regulations are being advanced, my Department is concurrently examining the scope to draft supplementary regulations to further expand the exemptions by way of reducing the proposed restriction zones around airports. </p></reply>

Increasing supply is at the heart of <i>Housing for All</i>and without appropriate institutional investment, activity in the housing market would be much reduced and the significant pressure already facing renters and prospective home-owners would increase further.</p><p>That said, the Government took action last year to ensure institutional investors do not inappropriately purchase homes better suited for individual buyers. It did so through a significant stamp duty increase, which has now been fully legislated for, and planning permission changes. This combination of measures is a balanced approach, which supports home ownership in lower density type developments, while maintaining and supporting finance for additional supply in high density projects where viability is an issue.</p></reply>

These are the Historic Structures Fund (HSF) and the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Community Monuments Fund (CMF).</p>  <p>  The HSF is for conservation and enhancement to heritage structures and historic buildings, in both private and public ownership, for the benefit of communities and the public. Included in the HSF is a stream for vernacular structures, under which conservation works to &lsquo;informal&rsquo; traditional buildings may be funded. The BHIS is a scheme for the repair and conservation of structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures (RPS). It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small-scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals. The CMF is for investment in archaeological heritage and helps owners and custodians of archaeological monuments to safeguard them into the future for the benefit of communities and the public.</p>  <p>  On 5 November 2021 I launched the 2022 BHIS and HSF schemes which will have funding of &euro;8m - an increase of &euro;2 million from 2021. Full details of both schemes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website as well as on the websites of the local authorities; it should be noted, however, that the deadline for applications to the local authorities for the 2022 schemes has now passed. On 17 November 2021 I launched the 2022 CMF scheme with funding of &euro;5m &ndash; an increase of almost &euro;1m from that awarded in 2021.  The deadline for applications to my Department from the local authorities for this scheme is 1 March 2022.</p>  <p>  It is intended to run all three schemes again in 2023 and full details will be available on my Department's website, and from the local authorities, from November onwards. You may wish to ascertain the eligibility of the structure you have in mind in the meantime. In the context of a particular building or historic structure, the best advice is generally to contact the Architectural Conservation Officer or Heritage Officer in the local authority who is very well placed to advise on the various types of funding available. </p></reply>

These measures will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to put affordability at the heart of the housing system and prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) delivering affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, (3) a First Home shared equity scheme and (4) expanding Part V planning requirements to increase the 10% contribution requirement to 20% and to apply it to cost rental as well as social and affordable housing.</p><p>This Act, supported by the unprecedented levels of funding committed to in the Housing for All strategy, averaging over &euro;4 billion annually, will underpin the delivery of affordable housing targets. Specifically, 54,000 affordable homes will be delivered between now and 2030 by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the Land Development Agency and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks.</p><p>There is no single or universally applicable definition denoting housing affordability. Typically, benchmark figures of between 30% and 40% spending of net household income on housing can be used by policy makers and commentators as &lsquo;rule of thumb&rsquo; measures of affordability. However, the limitations of such indicators is also frequently referenced given they do not consider household circumstance and expenditure that may, or may not, arise such as childcare and education costs or tenure type.  </p><p>Therefore defining affordability is not simply a question of <i>&lsquo;how much is too much?&rsquo;, </i>and may be better answered by asking<i>&lsquo;how much is too much for whom and in what circumstance?&rsquo;</i>This is why our affordable purchase schemes will provide for a household specific assessment of affordability. This strives to contribute to a more developed, responsive and appropriate housing system that offers people real choice for affordable housing when they need it.</p><p>Under the provisions of the Affordable Housing Act, each household's capacity to purchase or rent a home in the required location will be considered. Where households are deemed not to be able purchase a home in the private market, or secure a tenancy at the prevailing market rates, affordable housing supports will be made available. These assessments will be informed by the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s macro prudential rules which have been designed specifically to prevent house buyers from borrowing more than they can afford and to increase the financial resilience of borrowers.</p><p>The Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will support purchasers of Local Authority-delivered new homes by bridging the gap between the value of the home and the combined value of the buyer's available mortgage and deposit. Regulations to set out the detailed criteria are at an advanced stage and will be issued in the coming weeks. The first homes delivered through the scheme will be located in Cork City. Cork City Council indicated the purchase prices to be &euro;218,000 for a 2-bedroom and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling. This will be followed by a Fingal County Council supported affordable purchase development (Dun Emer). Fingal County Council have indicated these will cost &euro;166,000 for a 2-bed apartment and between &euro;206,000 and &euro;258,000 for 3-bed dwellings. A scale up of Local Authority-delivered affordable homes will be implemented under the Housing for All targets.</p><p>The First Home shared equity scheme, under Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act, will primarily support first-time buyers purchasing newly constructed homes on the private market. This scheme will be available at a national level and will incorporate regional price caps reflecting median house price sales. Confirmation of the final details of this scheme is ongoing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders and it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will be available for applications in Q2 of this year. This initiative is being designed to ensure support is provided to those that, because of the current income levels, cannot secure a sufficient mortgage to meet the cost of a modest newly constructed home in their preferred location.</p><p>Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act provided for the establishment of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland. The introduction of Cost Rental tenancies helps improve affordability and security in the rental market. Cost Rental tenancies rent levels are based on the cost of the provision of homes, rather than being subject to the pressures of the open market. Once tenanted, rents will increase only in line with consumer inflation, remaining stable in real terms, while continuing to cover management and maintenance costs on the properties.</p><p>Over 1,500 Cost Rental homes are expected to be developed and tenanted through three delivery strands in 2022: Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding; Local Authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF), and the Land Development Agency (LDA), either on their portfolio of sites, or through Project Tosaigh. All Cost Rental homes will deliver rent prices at least 25% below market rates.</p><p>The first 65 Cost Rental homes, delivered through CREL funding, were tenanted in 2021, with 25 at Taylor Hill in Balbriggan and a further 40 at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip. Both developments delivered cost-covering rents at least 40% below comparable open-market prices within their respective local areas.</p><p>Additionally the Help-to-Buy incentive supports first-time buyers in meeting the deposit requirements for newly-built houses or apartments, as well as self-build homes. Subject to the level of income tax and DIRT paid over the previous 4 years, the Help-to-Buy scheme provides a maximum benefit to first-time buyers of &euro;30,000 or 10% of the cost of the newly constructed home. The Help-to-Buy scheme has already helped over 30,000 first-time buyers achieve the deposit required for a new home. </p><p>The Local Authority Home Loan scheme commenced on 4 January 2022 and incorporates a lower interest rate, higher income eligibility thresholds for single applicants in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow (increasing from &euro;50,000 to &euro;65,000), and more flexibility on house size. The loan can be used for new and second-hand properties, or for self-builds with a maximum value of 90% of market value of a residential property. The maximum market values are &euro;320,000 in the counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and &euro;250,000 in the rest of the country.</p><p>The Help-to-Buy scheme, the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme and the First Home scheme are designed to assist first-time buyers in meeting the higher costs of newly constructed homes and, in doing so, will increase the volume of new homes being developed. Importantly the CSO reported that housing completions amounted to 20,433 in 2021, a welcome increase over the 2015 reported levels of 7,219. The CSO also report that Commencement Notices for 30,724 new homes were issued in 2021, representing a 42% increase compared with 2020, or roughly the same as the combined reported totals from 2016 &amp;amp; 2017. While these reported figures represent a significant step forward in the Government&rsquo;s ambition to support the supply of new housing, it remains short of the 33,000 new dwellings annual target under Housing for All. This is why the Government has committed unprecedented levels of funding, averaging &euro;4 billion per year to improve affordability for all families or individuals across society wishing to secure a home.</p></reply>

The NPPR charge, which has since been discontinued, applied from 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. The self-assessed charge was set at &euro;200 per annum.</p>  <p>  2013 was the last year in which a NPPR liability could be incurred. However, outstanding NPPR liabilities and payments remain payable to the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  NPPR charges, including late payment fees, expire 12 years from the date of liability. This means that NPPR liabilities incurred from 2009 to 2013 and remaining unpaid, the portion of the liability and charge on a property which related to 2009 expired in 2021, the 2010 portion will expire in 2022 and so on until the liability and charge on a property relating to the final year of NPPR in 2013, expires after 31 March 2025. </p>  <p>  There is no intention to re-introduce the NPPR charge. It was discontinued in 2013 in parallel with the introduction of the Local Property Tax, which has a much broader applicability.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. Fire services issues are managed in my Department by the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM).</p>  <p>  Fire services are provided in Ireland by local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, there are 31 fire authorities which provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Local authority fire services are delivered by approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide. 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even when staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in other areas of the local authority sector.</p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms/ standards being established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves. The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, ' Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.</p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires which occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.</p>  <p>  In May 2021, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management mandated a small internal project team to undertake a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;retained&rsquo; fire services delivery, with particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff, with the proviso that due consideration also be given to input from the County and City Management Association (CCMA).</p>  <p>  The objective of the review is to explore and understand the issues which are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options which will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future. The Project Team will work with and report to the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management Fire Service Operations Committee in the performance of its functions.</p>  <p>  The initial engagement element of the review was the gathering of appropriate data and information, to inform the needs analysis and option appraisals for further development. To that end, the project team undertook a procurement process and have secured the services of an independent consultant who will survey the views of the personnel who work in the retained fire services and those that have recently retired from the retained fire services. That feedback in conjunction with consultation at appropriate stages with all key stakeholders during the review process, including central and local government, the public, fire service management/staff, and the staffing interest groups will form the basis of the final review report. </p>  <p>  The final report is now in an early drafting stage, it is the expectation of the project team that the final review report will be submitted to the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management later in 2022.

It is understood that Maghaberry Prison has so far had a good record in preventing cases of Covid 19 in the prison.

Among the actions under the programme is a commitment from the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland to revisit the framework related to the separated regime and arrange for an independent review of the operation of the regime.

These rights pertain mainly to the exploration, exploitation, conservation and management of natural resources (living and non-living) and the protection of the marine environment.  Pursuant to Article 58 of UNCLOS, all states enjoy various high seas freedoms in the coastal state&rsquo;s EEZ, including freedom of navigation &ldquo;and other internationally lawful uses of the sea related to these freedoms&rdquo;.  The EEZ is therefore a hybrid maritime zone in which some sovereign rights of the coastal state overlap with high seas freedoms of all states.  Article 58 requires that in the exercise of these freedoms states &lsquo;shall have due regard to the rights and duties of the coastal state.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  While states are not obliged, in most cases, to inform the coastal authorities of any proposed naval exercises, my Department&rsquo;s attention has indeed been drawn to some such exercises that have taken place in Ireland&rsquo;s EEZ in the past.  Where relevant, officials have engaged with the states concerned, including to ensure that any such exercises are conducted with due regard to our own exercise of sovereign rights in the area.  Where a planned exercise includes use of international airspace, the state concerned must follow the agreed international procedure (as set down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation) for notifying the relevant authorities responsible for providing air traffic control services for the airspace affected.</p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to distinguish between this and the situation regarding our territorial sea, which extends up to 12 nautical miles from shore.  The coastal state exercises sovereignty within its territorial sea subject to the relevant rules of international law.  Within the territorial sea of a coastal state the ships of other states, including their warships, enjoy the right of innocent passage only &ndash; not freedom of navigation.  This means that naval exercise may not be conducted by them within the territorial sea except with the express consent of the coastal state.  The submarines of other states are required to navigate on the surface.</p>  <p>  Should a foreign naval or other state vessel used for non-commercial purposes wish to access an Irish port or harbour, my permission is required as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and a diplomatic clearance procedure is in place to consider requests for such permissions.   </p></reply>

The Commission have undertaken a significant body of work encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference.  The report contains 69 main recommendations and together with sub recommendations, there are 130 recommendations.  The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  </p>  <p>  The report proposes significant changes for the Defence Forces, including to high-level command and control structures, and for the level of Defence provision in Ireland.  Clearly, there are matters that will require careful consideration and in some critical aspects inter-departmental discussion and agreement. This includes the level of resourcing that may be allocated to Defence and the governance framework that will be required to underpin any changes the Government approve on foot of the Commission's report.   I will also be seeking the views of my Department and the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces Representative Associations will be consulted on all matters that fall within the scope of representation, relating to the implementation of any approved plan.   I also intend to engage with key stakeholders and the Oireachtas, which commenced with the D&aacute;il statement on the report which took place on 16 February.  When these deliberations are completed I intend to revert to Government with a proposed plan of action. </p>  <p>It is anticipated that this process will take at least four to five months in order to bring a considered and comprehensive proposal back to Government to address the fundamental issues that the Commission have set out.   </p></reply>

This period of service service was below the minimum length of service required to qualify for an occupational or service pension; however, a Short Service Gratuity was paid at the time.</p>  <p>  The person in question separately applied for a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts, which he was awarded in 1986.   In 1986 the value of his disability pension was &euro;4,071 (&pound;3,206) per year. The current rate of his disability pension is &euro;13,749 a year.</p>  <p>  The person in question also instituted civil proceedings in respect of the same injury and in July 1986 the High Court awarded him compensation of &euro;37,457 (&pound;29,500). His disability pension was therefore reviewed by the Minister for Defence in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(2) of the Army Pensions Act, 1923 (as amended). Section 13(2) provides:- </p>  <p>   &ldquo;Any compensation which may be received from or on behalf of the person alleged to be responsible for the act which caused the wounding&hellip;.. may be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of any pension, allowance or gratuity which might be awarded under this Act to or in respect of such person and if such compensation is received after the award of any such pension or allowance the Minister may review the award and, having regard to the amount of such compensation, either terminate or reduce the amount thereof&rdquo; </p>  <p>  The underlying objective of Section 13(2) is to take into consideration compensation paid &lsquo;on the double&rsquo; for the same disablement. </p>  <p>  In March 1987, the then Minister for Defence decided under the provisions of Section 13(2) to reduce the disability pension in question by the annuity value (as assessed by an Actuary) of the civil compensation received.  The annuity value of the civil compensation was assessed at &euro;3,648 (&pound;2,873) a year.  </p>  <p>  The person in question applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the Minister&rsquo;s decision to reduce his pension.  The High Court decided that he had not been given adequate opportunity to present his case before the decision to reduce the disability pension was made.  The Court quashed the decision to reduce the disability pension and ordered that the matter be considered anew.  The Court did not express any view as to the outcome of the review.  The Department consented to the High Court&rsquo;s decision and an Order to this effect was made. The Order did not preclude the then Minister for Defence from arriving at the same decision made previously. </p>  <p>  A fresh review of the disability pension was undertaken and all aspects of the case, including, in particular, representations made by his solicitors, were fully considered.  In March 1988 the then Minister decided to take into account all of the civil compensation received by him and to reduce the disability pension by the assessed annuity value of that compensation.  The reduction took place from 1 April 1988, some two years after the date of discharge and after payment of the pension had commenced.  </p>  <p>  As the annuity value was assessed at &euro;3,648 (&pound;2,873) a year the effect of the decision under Section 13(2) is to reduce the rate of disability pension payable from &euro;13,749 to &euro;10,101 a year at the current rates payable. The annual deduction of &euro;3,648 equates to a monthly deduction of &euro;304. (Defence Forces&rsquo; disability pensions are not subject to Income Tax.)  The annuity value has remained fixed at &euro;3,648 per annum since 1988; however, the annual value of the disability pension has increased over time from &euro;4,071 (&pound;3,206) in 1986 to a current value of &euro;13,749.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries.  On 27 October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13 September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. The Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale, on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern.  The Department has additionally offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions. These offers are subject to agreement on all elements of the claim. Engagement is continuing, with the aim of reaching an overall agreement: the most recent formal talks took place at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January, and the parties are to meet again later this week, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting. </p>  <p>  Public servant status and the associated access to a public service pension scheme is not a part of the current offer.  As previously set out in the joint statement following the WRC engagement in May 2021, the final element of the claim in respect of public service status is acknowledged by all parties to be more complex and will require more detailed analysis and consideration following the conclusion of current discussions. </p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement</p></reply>

Its policy advice is always informed by international best practice.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that NCSE published a progress report in November, 2019. At that stage, NCSE had reviewed existing educational provision in Ireland, conducted a detailed literature review, consulted various stakeholder groups and visited a number of Irish schools. NCSE had also looked at fully inclusive schools and practice in Canada and Portugal.</p>  <p>  The report found no evidence to show that one type of special education placement is better that another.  It also stated that any decision to move towards greater inclusion would require careful consideration and planning. It is not something that could be achieved in the short term.</p>  <p>  Since the publication of the progress report, NCSE has conducted further research and analysis, engaged in a public consultation survey and has received further submissions and expert inputs. It has also examined the implications arising from the UNCRPD.</p>  <p>  Before the advice is finalised, every effort is being made to ensure that NCSE has consulted widely with a view to developing shared understandings on the critical issues involved and proposed solutions.</p>  <p>  The policy advice is expected to be completed in 2022.</p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p><font color="#001A26">- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically roll over into the 2021/22 school year.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year inthe normal way.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased supportfor the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. </p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement.   My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

There are sound educational and pedagogical reasons for the requirement to hold both as this is a complex role which involves both teaching and guidance counselling.</p><p>It is the view of the Department that in order to be able to execute the full range of functions of the guidance counsellor in a post-primary school, a person needs to hold both qualifications. Notwithstanding the similar modules in sector specific teacher training programmes, teachers qualified to work in primary or further education sectors would still require post-primary sector specific training to be deemed fully qualified to competently work as a post primary teacher and / or guidance counsellor in a post-primary setting. </p><p>The Teaching Council and the Department of Education are cognisant of the value of education in society, of the unique role which teachers play within the education system in providing for the holistic development of students, and of the complex and intricate nature of teaching as it is elaborated in the Code of Professional Conduct for Teachers. The Council reiterates the critical objectives of promoting quality teaching and learning in all sectors. </p><p>Programmes of post-primary initial teacher education such as the Professional Master of Education (PME) prepare student teachers for core areas such as school and classroom planning, assessment, evaluation, classroom management and differentiated teaching to meet the age and stage appropriate needs of the individual learner. At the end of the initial teacher training PME course, students will have acquired the professional knowledge, understanding and skills needed to teach their subject or subjects in a post primary  school. They will have gained practical experience &lsquo;<b><i>school placement&rsquo;</i></b>in two contrasting school settings, and developed their ability to respond flexibly to the diverse and changing educational needs of students aged 12 to 18 years.</p><p>It remains the case that a person being assigned as a guidance counsellor <i>must</i>be a qualified and registered second-level teacher with the Teaching Council and, in addition, hold the relevant recognised qualification for school guidance work. </p><p>Information on the Programme Recognition Framework for Guidance Counselling can be found here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/dce0a0-programme-recognition-framework-guidance-counselling/  </p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.</p>  <p>  Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement. The talks continue, most recently at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January; the parties are to meet again later this week, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting.</p>  <p>  While there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. When the final package for secretaries has been agreed and an implementation plan is in place for schools and for the Department, similar engagement, on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers, will begin. </p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

This is a second-tier service which complements existing provision for children and young people with autism. Therefore, where autistic children and young people experience significant difficulties, the first course of action is engagement with first tier services provided by the Department of Education, (including NEPS), National Council for Special Education and Health Services Executive and (HSE)/ HSE funded services. </p>  <p>  The MCA Pilot is a second-tier service and works with a defined number of referrals. The nomination and referral process is initiated by parents and professionals at school level via the Principal following a multidisciplinary school based review involving the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), the local Special Educational Needs Officer (SENO) and other relevant professionals. Nominations cannot be made directly to Middletown Centre for Autism (MCA), the Department of Education or the NCSE.  </p>  <p>  Nominations for MCA Referral are only considered for children and young people where such a review concludes despite comprehensive autism specific support and consistent engagement from school and home with first-tier services, the child or young person continues to present with significant and enduring behavioural and emotional concerns which impact their engagement and participation in education. MCA&rsquo;s Learning Support &amp;amp; Assessment team builds on the work of first tier services and works alongside them to ensure their involvement in the process. They aim to create a strong base for building family and professional capacity to support the child when the referral concludes (normally after 10 months). </p>  <p>  The Centre provides a comprehensive nationwide training service for parents and educational professionals. Parents can view the range of courses which the Centre has available through the website, www.middletownautism.com.</p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. </p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement.   My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021. </p><p>To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021. Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required. As noted in Circular Letter 0065/2021 &ldquo;<b>Enhanced Minor Works Grant Funding for Primary Schools Exceptional Minor Works Grant Funding for Post Primary Schools with a particular focus on supporting enhanced ventilation</b>&rdquo; Scoil Mhuire Shankill may apply for additional  funding through the Emergency Works Scheme, which is available at gov.ie/en/circular/97829-emergency-works-grant-scheme-migration-to-on-line-applications-and-minor-revisions-of-scheme/  </p><p>Scoil Mhuire, Shankill received an original allocation of 9 CO2 monitors in 2021. The school were also approved for an additional 6 CO2 monitors by email on the 19<sup>th</sup>of January 2022. This brings their total allocation to 15 CO2 monitors, which exceeds the number of classrooms in the school by one unit, which can be used at their discretion in an auxiliary room. </p><p>The public health guidance for schools operating during Covid-19 includes some important general recommendations about ventilation practices in schools. </p><p>Schools are urged to:</p><p>- Consider if room ventilation especially in classrooms, break rooms and canteens can be improved without causing discomfort.</p><p>- Ensure that, wherever possible, doors and windows are open to increase natural ventilation.</p><p>- Increase air flow and ventilation weather permitting</p><p>The over-arching approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (e.g. during break-times or lunch-times and also at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p><p>It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy/colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom. Opening windows fully for a short period at the end of each school day avoids the need to do the same again before the start of classes in the morning and further assists in managing comfort levels in the classroom in the mornings (partially opened windows should enable good ventilation to be achieved when classrooms are occupied).This will assist in managing comfort levels and also heating costs during periods of colder weather.</p><p>It may also be of assistance to know that the Department has ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie.</p></reply>

It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any pupils attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.  </p>  <p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisation representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required, or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it, they should indemnify the school.  </p>  <p>  My Department cannot direct any member of the Board of Management or the teaching staff of the school to administer medical treatment to pupils, action and procedures which are normally carried out by medical professionals such as doctors and nurses. </p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of pupils for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school, when appointing an SNA. </p>  <p>  Where specific training is required to meet the needs of an individual pupil, it is recommended that the school liaise with child&rsquo;s parents to obtain the necessary guidance and training to enable the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally.</p>  <p>  Early years services are also required to have a Policy on the Administration of Medication which should include details of procedures to be followed in a medical emergency, including an allergic reaction.</p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website, www.energyineducation.ie, which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p>  <p>   In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.</p>  <p>  This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.  </p>  <p>  The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.</p>  <p>  The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of  Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability.  www.energyineducation.ie. Typically savings of between 5 to 10% are identified through low and no cost measures, while some schools participating have identified potential savings of up to 15 % or more.</p>  <p>  Furthermore my Department provides capitation funding to all recognised schools in the Free Education Scheme. The main grant is the capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating costs.</p>  <p>  The SEAI Annual Report 2021 on Public Sector Energy Efficiency Performance published this month notes  reporting compliance for schools for 2020 was 76% and the total energy spend of schools and ETBs that reported was &euro;34 Million, this represents approximately 6% of total public sector energy consumption reported.</p>  <p>  My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie.</p></reply>

This project is currently underway and will be in situ for September 2022. The school has put contingency arrangements in place to make best use of existing accommodation until the modular accommodation is ready to be occupied. </p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. The Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale, on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern.  The Department has additionally offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions. These offers are subject to agreement on all elements of the claim. Engagement is continuing, with the aim of reaching an overall agreement: the most recent formal talks took place at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January, and the parties are to meet again later this week, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting. </p>  <p>  Public servant status and the associated access to a public service pension scheme is not a part of the current offer.  As previously set out in the joint statement following the WRC engagement in May 2021, the final element of the claim in respect of public service status is acknowledged by all parties to be more complex and will require more detailed analysis and consideration following the conclusion of current discussions. </p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement</p></reply>

COVID-19 related absences arising from students who have been requested to self-isolate by a medical professional or for students who feel unwell with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 must be recorded in accordance with the school&rsquo;s normal procedures for the notification and recording of absences. However these COVID-19 related absences should be noted by the school as explained absences.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the current COVID-19 related environment that schools are now operating in, the statutory requirements for reporting pupil absenteeism will continue as normal. In this respect the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires the principal of a recognised school to maintain records of the attendance or non-attendance on each school day of each student enrolled in that school which is reported to Tusla.</p>  <p>  Tusla Education Support Service (TESS) receives notifications of all absences from school in line with the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. TESS is very aware that some students will be absent for Covid-19-related reasons. Absences are reported to TESS as explained and unexplained, and together they make up the cumulative number of days marked absent. This has remained the reporting requirement throughout COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Daily school attendance data is collected and held at local school level and collected by Tusla at the aggregated level through the Annual Attendance Report (AAR) and, also at the student level through the Student Absence Report (SAR). Any child who misses 20 school days must be reported to Tusla by law, however this may not result in any intervention, particularly if the absences are explained. Where schools have a concern about a child&rsquo;s attendance they are required to make a referral to TESS Education Welfare Service. TESS views all school attendance referrals from a child welfare perspective with the intention of finding solutions that will enable and support students to attend, participate and be retained in education.</p></reply>

My Department generally includes a SEN Base in all new schools, as well as replacement school buildings and extensions. My Department also funds the provision of additional accommodation, or the reconfiguration of existing accommodation, where a new special class is sanctioned by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p>  <p>  The NCSE has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive. This includes the establishment of special class and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE takes account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation both current and planned. The Council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate the class under the Additional School Accommodation scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department has no current applications on hand for SEN class accommodation from the school planning area in question.  There are currently 6 special educational needs (SEN) classes in the Clonmel school planning area.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.</p>  <p>  Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement. The talks continue, most recently at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January; the parties are to meet again later this week, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting.</p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

From September 2020, LCCS was available to schools nationally as a full optional subject. The numbers of schools offering the subject is growing. There are currently approximately 145 schools across the country offering this subject to their students.  </p>  <p>  The approach to the provision of the subject by schools has been informed by the valuable learning gathered from the phased introduction of the subject since September 2018.  </p>  <p>  Uniquely, this also included a Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Discover funded research project to track the development of progress of teachers of the subject during the first two years of the subject rollout. A Department led group was formed to assist in, and have oversight of, this research study and its findings. </p>  <p>   The introduction of this new subject to schools is supported by a Leaving Certificate Computer Science Support Framework. This framework represents a collaboration between the Department of Education, IBEC, the Computers in Education Society of Ireland (CESI), the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), the Irish Universities Association (IUA), higher education institutions, Ibec, the Technological Higher Education Association (THEA) and SOLAS.   </p>  <p>  The framework puts in place key actions to promote a broad take-up of the subject at both ordinary and higher level. There is a focus on actions to support greater female participation and greater participation amongst students who would not have traditionally considered subjects like Computer Science for the Leaving Certificate. </p>  <p>  For schools who are considering the introduction of LCCS onto their curriculum an &ldquo;Expression of Interest&rdquo; process is currently being carried out by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) to ascertain teachers&rsquo; professional learning needs so as to support the effective delivery of the new subject in schools. </p>  <p>  My Department has issued over &euro;250m under the ICT grant directly to schools since 2016, which underpins the implementation of the embedding  of digital technologies in all classroom and school activity, and supports the building of digital skills in the student population. As outlined in the circulars accompanying this grant, this funding can assist schools in the implementation of STEM subjects, of new and revised subject specifications at Junior and Senior Cycle, and the changes to the primary curriculum, where the use of digital technologies enables the delivery of same. </p>  <p>  Partnership with business and industry in sustaining the growth of Computer Science is central to the operation of this Framework. Business and industry can contribute to enhancing opportunities for students to access high-quality information and experience in relation to careers in Computer Science. These take the form of school visits by relevant personnel, input to careers evenings, participation in co-curricular and extracurricular events. Engagement of business and industry representatives with teachers of computer science through buddy systems, teacher internships etc. will also be hugely important. </p>  <p>  All of these supports have been designed to ensure there is capacity within the system for long-term, sustainable growth of Leaving Certificate Computer Science. </p></reply>

The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), introduced in 2016, enables the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities/additional needs in the ECCE Programme.  The goal of AIM is to create a more inclusive environment in preschools, so all children, regardless of ability, can benefit from quality early learning and care. A diagnosis of autism (or other disabilities/additional needs) is not required to access AIM supports. However, preschool children with a diagnosis are generally supported in mainstream preschools with additional supports provided through AIM where required. </p><p>NCSE sanctions the establishment of special classes, including ASD Early Intervention (EI) classes where there is an identified need. I understand that, on occasion, EI classes are re-designated as school-age special classes to reflect the changing age-profile of students, the changing needs in an area and in order to ensure a continuation of support for students in the EI class who require a special class placement.</p><p>The school referenced by the Deputy currently has two ASD special classes and one Early Intervention class which opened in September 2020. </p><p>At that time, the school agreed that while the class would open as an Early Intervention ASD class, it would be re-designated as an additional primary ASD class from September 2022 to meet the projected demand for places in the area. </p><p>This additional special class would cater for the students enrolled in the Early Intervention class should they continue to require a special class place for their primary education at that time.</p><p>I also understand that earlier this month, the school engaged with the NCSE regarding the emerging need for the retention of the Early Intervention class in the school and requested that the class be retained. </p><p>This request is being considered by the NCSE as a matter of urgency and a meeting has been arranged with the school to review the level of need in the area and the capacity of the school to meet the need.  </p><p>A decision will be made very quickly on the matter.  </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the NCSE will take account of the overall need in the area and the provision required to meet that need.</p><p>As referenced above, ASD EI classes are generally re-designated, not closed. The number of active ASD EI classes in each of the school years from 2015/2016 to date is detailed in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>School   Year</th>       <th>Early   Intervention</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015/16</td>       <td>118</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016/17</td>       <td>127</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017/18</td>       <td>130</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018/19</td>       <td>129</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019/20</td>       <td>132</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020/21</td>       <td>135 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021/22</td>       <td>132 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Both my Department and the NCSE are always grateful to schools who express a willingness to open a special class to meet the educational needs of students in their local communities. </p><p>The local SENOs remain available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs.</p><p>Information on the location of EI classes is available on the NCSE website. </p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland.</p><p>This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs.  This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>Approximately 1,200 school building projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction &ndash; most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period 2021 to 2025.</p><p>The current status of these projects being delivered is listed on a county by county basis on <i>www.gov.ie</i>and is updated on a monthly basis to reflect their progress through the various stages.</p></reply>

The New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG) is an external independent advisory group which was set up in 2011 to advise the Minister on the patronage of new schools. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. </p><p>An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) provides objective information to parents in the relevant school planning areas to assist them in making an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction for the new school.  A prospective patron can choose the school(s) it wishes to apply for and complete an application form in that regard for each school, for submission to my Department.  The Department provides details on the OPPS of the school(s) and the list of applicant patrons which have applied for patronage of the school(s).  Parents access the OPPS website, which allows them to access the appropriate survey for their area, to input the details of the eligible child(ren) and to select their preferred patron and language of instruction (where applicable).  Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of the process.</p><p>Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website, <i>www.education.ie</i>, or <i>www.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>There are a number of Capital projects planned or underway in Dublin 9 and 11 the following are in Multi or Inter-denominational schools.Rosmini Community School, Drumcondra, Dublin 9, whose ethos is Inter- Denominational, the project is currently at Stage 3 (tender action, evaluation and award) to provide a long-term enrolment for 350 pupils plus a 2 SEN Base.  Additionally, there is a Major capital project for Clonturk Community College, Whitehall, Dublin 9, whose ethos is Multi-Denominational, to provide a long-term enrolment for 1,000 pupils plus 4 SEN Base which is currently at project brief stage (determining the project brief and schedules of accommodation). In the interim, capital funding has also been approved for the provision of Modular Accommodation for 12 general classrooms and 6 specialist classrooms.  </p><p>The requirement for additional school places is kept under on-going review. Additionally, my Department will continue to liaise with the local authority in respect of its review of their Development Plan with a view to identifying any potential long-term school accommodation requirements in the areas of Dublin 9 and 11.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.</p>  <p>  Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement. The talks continue, most recently at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January; the parties are to meet again later this week, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting.</p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

This additional accommodation encompasses provision for 6 additional mainstream classrooms, science, home economics, textiles, art, music, DCG, technology rooms, and staff room in addition to 4 classrooms for children with special educational needs. This project has been agreed by and devolved to the school authority for delivery. </p>  <p>  At the request of the patrons, my Department agreed to the amalgamation taking effect from September 2022. Following subsequent engagement and again at the request of the school patrons, my Department has now agreed to extend the timeline for opening St Seton&rsquo;s Secondary School. The school patrons will use this time to engage in further planning and coordination with the school community before agreeing a new timeline for opening the school. </p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. </p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. </p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.</p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement.   My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.</p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. </p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs anddeveloping schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to theNCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website<font color="#444444">, </font>www.ncse.ie/for-schools  </p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website, www.ncse.ie.</p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not included in this model of allocation and continue to be allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in the normal way. </p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Gov.ie website, www.gov.ie/en/circulars/?organisation=department-of-education  </p><p>Under this allocation model, the SNA allocation to a school can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time. There is a prescribed special class to SNA ratio.</p><p>ASD special classes have an allocation of 1 teacher and 2 SNA posts to cater for the educational and care needs of 6 students. Additional SNA support may also be sanctioned by the NCSE where there are individual children who have significant care needs which require support above the level of support already sanctioned to the school.</p><p>As the question relates to the allocation of supports by the NCSE, your correspondence has been forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply. </p><p>The NCSE have confirmed that an application for additional SNA support has been received from the school (as outlined in the details supplied) and that the SENO will be in contact with the school to arrange a visit after the mid-term break to progress the application. </p></reply>

The guide states that inspection reports along<i></i>with other types of evidence gathered by the school should also be used by schools to inform their self-evaluation processes and their planning for improvement and development. The guide makes clear that while responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the recommendations and improvements in an inspection report rests mainly with the board and principal, the patron or trustees of a school also have a responsibility to ensure that effective follow-up action is taken. A school may wish to access the assistance available from the Department&rsquo;s school support services or it may access advice and support from other bodies including its trustees or persons engaged by them. </p><p>The published inspection report to which the Deputy refers contains a commitment, in the form of a School Response on behalf of the Board of Management of the school, to address and fully implement all recommendations in the report.

Each acquisition is also very unique and dependant on multiple factors many which may be outside of the control of my Department. The Deputy will also appreciate the importance of conducting a thorough appraisal of site options before proceeding with an acquisition in order to obtain best value for the Exchequer. In this regard, it is not possible to give a specific timeframe for the completion of site acquisitions.</p>  <p>  Given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally I am not in a position to comment further at this time.

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. The Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale, on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern.  The Department has additionally offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions. These offers are subject to agreement on all elements of the claim. Engagement is continuing, with the aim of reaching an overall agreement: the most recent formal talks took place at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January, and the parties are to meet again later this week, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting. </p>  <p>  Public servant status and the associated access to a public service pension scheme is not a part of the current offer.  As previously set out in the joint statement following the WRC engagement in May 2021, the final element of the claim in respect of public service status is acknowledged by all parties to be more complex and will require more detailed analysis and consideration following the conclusion of current discussions. </p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement</p></reply>

COVID-19 related absences arising from pupils/students who have been requested to self-isolate by a medical professional or for students who feel unwell with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 must be recorded in accordance with the school&rsquo;s normal procedures for the notification and recording of absences. However these COVID-19 related absences should be noted by the school as explained absences. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the current COVID-19 related environment that schools are now operating in, the statutory requirements for reporting pupil absenteeism will continue as normal. In this respect the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires the principal of a recognised school to maintain records of the attendance or non-attendance on each school day of each pupil registered at that school which is reported to Tusla. </p>  <p>  Tusla Educational Support Service (TESS) receives notifications of all absences from school as per the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. TESS is very aware that some students will be absent for legitimate Covid-19-related health reasons. Absences are reported to TESS as explained and unexplained, and together they make up the cumulative number of days marked absent. This has remained the reporting requirement throughout COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  Daily school attendance data is collected and held at local school level and collected by Tusla at the aggregated level through the Annual Attendance Report (AAR) and, also at the student level through the Student Absence Report (SAR). Any child who misses 20 school days must be reported to Tusla by law, however this may not result in any intervention, particularly if the absences are explained. Where schools have a concern about a child&rsquo;s attendance they are required to make a referral to TESS Education Welfare Service. TESS views all school attendance referrals from a child welfare perspective with the intention of finding solutions that will enable and support students to attend, participate and be retained in education.</p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p>  <p>  In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p>  <p>  - Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p>  <p>  - No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p>  <p>  - SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p>  <p>  - Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p>  <p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website, ncse.ie/for-schools.</p>  <p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website, www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually. Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited in order to observe the current deployment of SNA support in the school setting.</p>  <p>  The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided. </p>  <p>Where a school is dissatisfied with how their exceptional review has been processed or is dissatisfied with the outcome of their exceptional review they can appeal. Applications for Appeal may be submitted through the NCSE Schools Portal: ncse.ie/school-support.

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September 2021, there was significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.</p>  <p>  Further dialogue has taken place between the parties on these issues since 13 September with the aim of reaching an overall agreement. The talks continue, most recently at a meeting at the WRC on 26 January; the parties are to meet again later this week, following reflection on the matters discussed at that meeting.</p>  <p>  While there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. When the final package for secretaries has been agreed and an implementation plan is in place for schools and for the Department, similar engagement, on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers, will begin. </p>  <p>  I welcome the continued engagement between the parties and I encourage all stakeholders to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

I also equalised the income limits for one and two parent households, thereby making it easier for lone parents to qualify for that payment.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-22a.1447.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022200078#WRDD02800"><p>Ireland has a unified system of social security whereby all contributions paid by workers (and their employers, where applicable) are paid into a single fund, the Social Insurance Fund (SIF), from which various benefits are paid to those withe established entitlement.  </p>  <p>  The Irish social welfare system recognises different categories or &ldquo;Classes&rdquo; of workers.  The rate of contribution paid by these categories differs.  They can therefore access different levels of social insurance benefits.  For example, Class A employees, generally private sector employees and post 6 April 1995 public servants, pay a combined employer and employee PRSI rate and qualify for all social insurance benefits.  In contrast, Class B public sector employees pay a much lower combined PRSI rate.  Consequently, they qualify for a restricted range of social insurance benefits.  They do not qualify for the State pension (contributory), relying instead on their occupational pensions.</p>  <p>  The State Pension (Contributory) is a social insurance payment for people aged 66 or over, who satisfy certain social insurance contribution conditions.  The purpose of the State Pension (Non-Contributory) which is a means tested payment, is to ensure those individuals with limited or no income or assets receive the most support from the State.  </p>  <p>  Primary weekly social welfare payments are intended to enable recipients to meet their basic day-to-day income needs.  In addition, my Department also provides a range of other payments, both cash and non-cash, on a weekly, monthly, or less frequent basis.  These payments are considered secondary in nature.</p>  <p>  The Living Alone Increase (LAI) is one of those secondary payments.  It is not a scheme or a stand-alone payment, but rather it is a supplement to a social welfare payment to people aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone. </p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed to direct the limited resources available to the Department in as targeted a manner as possible, and so it is focused on recipients of long-term social protection payments where an applicant satisfies a means test.  People in receipt of such long-term supports are unlikely to have additional resources of their own and are more vulnerable to poverty, including energy poverty.</p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices.  To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has announced additional expenditure measures to a total of &euro;505 million which will make a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet from their own resources.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  Any decision to allow those in receipt of occupational pensions who are not in receipt of a qualifying payment to receive the fuel allowance or the living alone increase would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, Benefit Payment for 65 year olds is paid at the maximum weekly personal rate which is &euro;208 irrespective of the previous earnings or income. </p>  <p>  To be eligible for the payment a person must satisfy all the qualifying conditions of the scheme including the requirement to have the specified number of social insurance contributions paid.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020, provides, amongst other measures, for the attribution of social insurance contributions, for a prescribed period, to insured persons who were beneficiaries of certain Covid-19 income support payments.  These payments include the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and Jobseekers Payment in lieu of PUP. </p>  <p>  The attribution of contributions ensured that persons entitled to and in receipt of the PUP had social insurance contributions attributed to them at the same value as they were paying while employed immediately before going on the payment.  </p>  <p>  If a self-employed customer was entitled to and in receipt of PUP, or a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment in lieu of PUP,  and was not liable to make a self-employment contribution in respect of the 2020 contribution year, they will, in accordance with the provisions of Statutory Instrument 730 of 2021,  Social Welfare (Consolidated Contributions of Insurability)(Amendment)(No.2)(Attribution of Self-Employment Contributions) Regulations 2021, be attributed 52 self-employment contributions in respect of that year. This attribution process is expected to happen in early March. </p>  <p>  These measures mean that people who lost their employment arising from the Covid-19 pandemic will not be disadvantaged in accessing social insurance benefits in the future, including the Benefit Payment for 65 year olds.</p>  <p>  Where a person does not satisfy the conditionality for receipt of the Benefit Payment for 65 year olds they may apply for means tested Jobseeker's Allowance. </p>  <p>  Finally, If the Deputy is referring to a specific case I would advise that they should forward the details to my Department for review,</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.  </p></reply>

Factors such as an individual&rsquo;s social insurance record, their attachment to the workforce, and their countries of employment affect the rate of pension entitlement.  </p>  <p>  I have arranged for a copy of the person&rsquo;s social insurance contribution record to issue to them, together with an application form for State pension (contributory). On receipt of a completed application, the person&rsquo;s entitlement to State pension (contributory) can be determined and they will be notified of the outcome.</p>  <p>  Another option is the Increase for qualified adult payment.  As the person&rsquo;s spouse is in receipt of State pension (contributory), the person concerned may qualify for an Increase for qualified adult (IQA) payable with their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  This is a means-tested payment, payable to a State pension (contributory) recipient whose spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is being wholly or mainly maintained by them, and where that qualified adult&rsquo;s personal means from any source does not exceed a means test income limit.  </p>  <p>  The rate of IQA depends on the rate of State pension (contributory) in payment to the primary pensioner and on the IQA means test. The means test for IQA is assessed on the qualified adult&rsquo;s means, solely or jointly held (50% of jointly-held means).  </p>  <p>  Where a qualified adult is assessed with weekly means of less than &euro;100, the maximum rate of IQA is payable.  Where assessable weekly means are over &euro;100 and not more than &euro;310, a tapering reduced rate of IQA is payable.  If the qualified adult has means of more than &euro;310 per week, this exceeds the means limit and there is no entitlement to an IQA payment.</p>  <p>  I have therefore arranged for an application form to issue for the IQA payment, if the person&rsquo;s spouse wishes to apply for this Increase on their State pension (contributory) in respect of the person concerned.  Eligibility will be determined on receipt of a completed application form.</p>  <p>  Where eligibility is established for both the State pension (contributory) in the person's own right and for the IQA payment on their spouse's pension, the more financially beneficial rate of payment will be awarded.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer/employee relationship and the contract of employment.  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has made rulings in a series of age-discrimination cases concerning Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibit work-related discrimination on various grounds, including age.  The CJEU has clarified that mandatory retirement ages may be set down by employers within the context of national law, whether by contract, custom and practice or other means, but that these must be objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate social policy aim, with the means of achieving that aim being both appropriate and necessary. </p>  <p>  Employees have recourse to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) in the event of breaches and the WRC has a number of adjudications on such matters.  To assist employers and employees in this regard and in respect of retirement ages, the WRC has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that we established the Pensions Commission in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved.  The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021.  The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.   </p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.   It established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed.  It has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard - including aligning retirement ages in employment contracts with the State Pension Age, PRSI base broadening measures, and allowing a person to continue paying PRSI contributions past State Pension Age to improve their social insurance record for State Pension (Contributory) purposes.</p>  <p>  Successive Governments have committed to supporting older peoples&rsquo; continued engagement in economic and social life, including in the National Positive Ageing Strategy (2013), the Report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Fuller Working Lives (2016) and the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018 &ndash; 2023 (2018).  Building on the work of these previous groups, the Pensions Commission supported measures to facilitate and encourage fuller working lives.  The Commission also fully supported Government commitments to facilitate employees remaining at work past the prevalent contractual retirement age of 65 if they wish to. </p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, this Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  The report was referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands.  That Committee published its views on the 2nd February 2022.  I and my officials will consider these views in our deliberations over the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  Separately, as set out in its terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is considering the report of the Pensions Commission in the context of its review of potential changes to the social insurance system, including relevant PRSI rates and coverage recommendations.  In addition, my officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system. </p>  <p>  I think it is really important that we complete that work and get those views before reaching conclusions on any one recommendation such as the recommendation to align retirement ages in employment contracts with the State Pension Age.  I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March this year.  </p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension Age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A person is required to have a minimum of 520 paid reckonable PRSI contributions in order to qualify for the State Pension (Contributory). T he actuarial value of the State Pension is estimated at over &euro;300,000 which requires people who claim a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over the 50 year term of a working life.  It is reasonable to require people who seek a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years paid contributions into the Social Insurance Fund which finances it.</p>  <p>  Those with fewer than the minimum number of PRSI contributions paid over the years may alternatively qualify for the State Pension (Non-Contributory), which is a means-tested pension, financed by the Exchequer, and paid at up to 95% the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  There are also significant disregards in the household means test for the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a Qualified Adult (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate State Pension (Contributory).  The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances. </p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans for a top-up payment to be made to those who do not qualify for either the State Pension (Contributory) or the State Pension (Non-Contributory) and it is not clear on what basis such an approach could be considered.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 1,023,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit. </p>  <p>  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to a person with any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.

While the Department funds participant and supervisor wages, the Department is not the employer of any scheme participants, their supervisors or team leaders.</p>  <p>  The State is not responsible for funding pension arrangements for employees of private companies, even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding.  Pension arrangements are a matter to be agreed between employees and their employers.  All employers, including CE and JI sponsoring organisations are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors have been seeking for several years through their union representatives, SIPTU and Forsa, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme for CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors who are employed by CE scheme sponsoring organisations.  </p>  <p>  Within this context, officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform held discussions on proposals to progress and resolve this complex issue, while having regard to the wider budgetary framework.

In addition to improvements in core social welfare rates, there were a number of targeted measures designed to support those most vulnerable to poverty, including increases to the Fuel Allowance and Living Alone Allowance. As energy prices were increasing, I ensured that the increase to the Fuel Allowance rate was implemented from Budget week. I also broadened eligibility for the scheme.</p>  <p>  As a result of these targeted measures, many of the most vulnerable pensioners have seen larger increases in 2022. For example, a pensioner in receipt of fuel allowance, living alone, will see an increase of &euro;13 per week during the fuel season due to measures introduced in Budget 2022.</p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to the Department, in as targeted a manner as possible.  People who are in receipt of a qualifying contributory payment are required to satisfy a means test, while recipients of non-contributory payments are accepted as satisfying the means test.</p>  <p>  The amount of means allowed to qualify for fuel allowance is the equivalent of the current maximum rate of State Pension (Contributory) (SPC) including any increases, plus &euro;120. This means for example, that a person in receipt of SPC, with a qualifying spouse, may have a total weekly income of just over &euro;600 and still qualify for fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices. To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has announced additional expenditure measures costing in excess of a half a billion Euro, which will make a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.</p>  <p>  The measures include an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125, which will be paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment. It is expected that this additional lump sum will be paid in early March at an estimated cost of &euro;49 Million.</p>  <p>  As such, this lump sum payment is intended to target the most vulnerable pensioners, as well as other social welfare recipients, to ensure that they are protected against rising fuel costs.</p>  <p>  This payment, in addition to the Budget increase to the Fuel Allowance, will mean low-income households see an increase of 41% this Fuel Allowance season compared to the last season.</p>  <p>  While not all pensioners will benefit from this lump sum payment, every household in the State will receive an Energy Credit of &euro;200, which will to be applied to electricity bills.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to monitor this situation carefully. </p></reply>

It is estimated that up to 400,000 households will benefit in 2022.  The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to the Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  This ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2022 the Government increased the weekly means threshold for the fuel allowance scheme by &euro;20 to &euro;120 above the appropriate rate of contributory State pension representing a 20% increase in the threshold which enables more people to qualify for this support.  </p>  <p>  Any decision to introduce a system of tapered fuel rates for cases that have means greater than the allowed &euro;120 would have cost implications for the scheme and could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  The &euro;120 a week means limit is significantly higher than the weekly fuel allowance rate of &euro;33 and also the combined weekly total of household benefits and fuel allowance added together (&euro;41.05).  It should be recalled that many of those aged over 66 are solely dependent upon the State pension, and so a person who has additional pension income above &euro;120, is not among the more disadvantaged people that Fuel Allowance is targeted towards.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department also provides Exceptional Needs Payments, which may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The fuel allowance means test is linked to the maximum rate of State pension (contributory) and Increase for qualified adult.  Currently, the applicant and their spouse can have a combined weekly household income of &euro;120 above the maximum rates for State pension (contributory) and Increase for qualified adult and still be eligible for fuel allowance.  </p>  <p>  An application for fuel allowance from the person concerned was received on 27 October 2021.  According to the records of my Department, the person&rsquo;s spouse is not in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment in their own right, nor are they a qualified adult on the State pension (contributory) of the person concerned.  </p>  <p>  Consequently, the person was notified on 5 January 2022 that they do not qualify for fuel allowance as their household includes people who are not eligible for the purposes of fuel allowance.  If these circumstances change, it is open to them to reapply for fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s MAs are fully qualified medical practitioners who have experience and specialist training/qualifications in occupational medicine as well as in human disability evaluation.   The MA&rsquo;s assessment and resulting opinion given to the DO is made in accordance with the Department's evidence-based medical guidelines and protocols. These guidelines/protocols are available for viewing on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the DO is not disputing the person&rsquo;s diagnosis or treatment but rather is assessing the person&rsquo;s eligibility for the relevant scheme in accordance with the relevant statutory conditions.  Each DO is trained in the principles of decision making and natural Justice. Scheme guidelines are provided to ensure consistency and a standardised approach in decision making. Each DO is familiar with the legal basis for making their decision and comply within  these provisions. They act impartially and make decisions based on supporting documentation.

A further &euro;2.2m was secured in capital carryover bringing total capital funding available to &euro;10.5m in 2021. The upgrading of the fire safety measures in existing early learning and childcare services was the key objective of the 2021 Capital Programme, with &euro;10.5 million available funding.</p>  <p>   During 2021, my Department successfully secured &euro;70m in the revised National Development Plan (NDP) allocation. This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during 2023-2025. Investment under the NDP will consist of three pillars: Modernisation, New Capacity and First 5 Initiatives.</p>  <p>  (1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.</p>  <p>  (2) New Capacity: Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase. In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.</p>  <p>  (3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Capital funding has been reduced in 2022 to &euro;0.5m as my Department focusses on the preparation of distribution of NDP funding from 2023 onwards. This will include setting eligibility criteria, designing and developing the application process, and establishing approval criteria. This 2022 allocation is for Childminding and Parent and Toddler Groups, who maintain 2021 allocations. In addition, my Department has secured some &euro;750k of unspent 2021 capital funding which will be carried into 2022.  This funding will be made available to provide financial assistance to providers to comply with fire safety regulations.</p>  <p>  Further information on the Department&rsquo;s NDP allocation and the application process will be communicated to the sector in the near future. The Department advises the service to contact their local CCCs, who will provide information on future capital supports when it becomes available.  </p></reply>

The most recent available data indicates the average hourly wage for non-managerial staff in the sector in 2021 was &euro;12.60, with many staff working part-time or on temporary contracts.

As such, I cannot provide the data requested by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Each organisation funded under these arrangements operate independently of Tusla. Each is responsible for the recruitment of employees and the terms and conditions under which individuals are employed. Section 56(14) of the Act of 2013 stipulates that &lsquo;an arrangement under this section shall not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Prior to the establishment of Tusla in 2014 some of the organisations now funded under section 56 were funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004. In October 2018 the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) reached agreement between the Department of Health and HSE and trade unions representing staff in certain section 39 organisations. Pay restoration in relation to organisations funded through section 39 was applied to organisations who met certain specific criteria. </p>  <p>  The criteria related to the organisations rather than types of individual workers that are employed in them. The criteria included only organisations who received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE by way of the Service Level Agreement process. Pay restoration was limited and solely applicable to those organisations included in the initial WRC agreement. This process has reached a final resolution and there is no scope to revisit eligibility criteria. </p></reply>

Of these, 17 services were listed exclusively as a drop-in service, with a further 10 services including drop-in as part of their wider service provision. On this basis, there were 27 services providing drop-in services, representing 0.65% of the total number of early years services on the national register.</p><p>Tusla does not collate the requested data by local authority area but does collate it by county. As at the end of January 2022, the total number of registered early years services listed as a drop-in broken down by county is as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Exclusively Drop In</th>       <th>Part of Wider Service</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin </td>       <td>5 </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>4 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>17 </td>       <td>10 </td>       <td>27 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Most of the early years services on the Tusla register operating as drop-in services are situated in hotels, shopping centres and leisure centres; however, there are some in other settings, which receive funding by State, (e.g. services operating as drop-in services situated in Family Resource Centres, refugees or Drug Treatment Services).</p><p>As with any early years service, drop-in services must register with Tusla and meet the regulatory standards as set out in the Childcare Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016. Drop-in services are intended to be used exclusively on an intermittent basis and children attending should attend for no more than 2 hours consecutively.  Given this, children who attend early years services operating exclusively as drop-in services are not funded under my Department&rsquo;s funding schemes, specifically the ECCE programme (which operates over 3 hours per day, 5 days per week, 38 weeks per year) or the NCS and CCSP.</p></reply>

My Department provides funding to childcare providers under a number of programmes to provide fully or partly subsidised childcare services to families.  Childcare providers are private businesses and my Department does not provide funding for specific operational costs such as insurance.</p><p>With regard to the cost of insurance, it is important to note that neither the Government, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, insurance reform is a priority for this Government. The <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>, which was launched on 8 December 2020, contains a range of deliverables in a number of Government Department policy areas. It is intended that the cumulative effect of the implementation of the actions will be to improve the insurance environment, in particular for businesses. I am a member of the Sub-Group for Insurance Reform, chaired by An T&aacute;naiste, which has been set up within the Cabinet Committee for Economic Recovery and Investment to implement these reforms, and will publish progress reports every six months.</p><p>Seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government. In this regard, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to ensure that the implementation of the <i>Action Plan</i>can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses and voluntary groups, including childcare providers.</p></reply>

More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p>  <p>  To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme.</p>  <p>  Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups, and in certain areas and my Department was taking a number of steps to address this, principally through capital investment through the National Development Plan.</p>  <p>  Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21%.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, particularly in light of the recent lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.</p>  <p>  Pobal has, using the data captured in June 2021 and current registration data, recently projected vacancy rates in February 2022. While this analysis shows a fall in vacancy rates from June 2021 to February 2022 &ndash; with vacancy rates falling from 21% to 19%, this analysis suggests that there is unused capacity across the country. Further analysis is being undertaken by Pobal to establish if this unused capacity varies by type of provision or location, to establish any mismatch is supply and demand for certain cohorts or children or in certain areas.</p>  <p>  Pobal will also commence new data collection in April 2022, as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey. This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established. In addition, my Department is undertaking research on the early learning and childcare needs of parents who work atypical hours or live in rural communities under way. </p>  <p>  Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance.

Following the cessation of EWSS, a once-off Transition Fund will operate from May to August 2022, to support providers in the period leading up to the new Core Funding stream, in return for a commitment not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. The sum paid to each service under the Transition Fund will depend on the service&rsquo;s capacity and location, and will reflect opening hours.</p></reply>

This includes their research activities. In 2020 the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (D/FHERIS), secured a package of &euro;168m to address the impact of COVID -19 restrictions on Higher Education. Of the &euro;168m, &euro;48m was provided to help address the impact of the same restrictions on research. </p>  <p>  I am not involved in the assessment of individual cases. The Higher Education Authority was given responsibility for the allocation of these monies to institutions and the funding is administered centrally by the research office led by the Head of Research (or equivalent) in each institution. Extensions supported by this funding were to be allocated to the researchers and research students in greatest need.</p>  <p>  I understand from the HEA that each individual applicant&rsquo;s eligibility to receive a costed extension was determined on a case-by-case basis by their institution and, where relevant, approval to grant a costed extension was to be secured from the appropriate research funder.  At TCD part time PhD candidates who are employed by the Department of Education on a full-time basis were confirmed by the institution as eligible to receive a costed extension. In accordance with the &lsquo;One Person One Salary&rsquo; (OPOS) principle, serving public servants require the consent of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to undertake other forms of paid remuneration in any part of the public service. </p>  <p>  I understand that the institution involved sought consent form the HEA to approach DPER seeking permission to provide the candidates with the extra payment a costed extension would bring. Given that the candidates were in full time public service, and were not previously in receipt of a stipend, the HEA turned down the request in relation to a stipend.   Research costs may be issued to the candidates through their research account and any subsequent tax liabilities will be the responsibility of the individual. Fees for those impacted by COVID have been waived by institutions. </p></reply>

The allocation of the core grant is determined on a formula basis &ndash; based on a standard per capita amount in respect of weighted EU student numbers (and non-EU research) in broad subject price groups. Student numbers are weighted to reflect the relative cost of the subject groups. The standard per capita amount depends on the total level of funding received each year. Total available funding divided by total weighted student numbers equals the standard per capita amount. The model also takes account of research and access metrics.</p><p>The core grant is allocated as a block grant to cover core teaching and research activities within institutions. The internal allocation of funds as between teaching and research and across faculties and departments etc is a matter for each institution.</p><p>Students on <b>pharmacy</b>and <b>science</b>programmes are included and counted for funding purposes in the RGAM. In 2022 such students attracted c.&euro;2,670 per student through the RGAM.  In addition,  eligible undergraduate students have their fees paid by the Exchequer, exclusive of the student contribution, under the Free Fees Scheme. The HEA pays c. &euro;4,400 per eligible undergraduate pharmacy/science degree student in the university sector. </p><p>As referenced above, students are liable for the student contribution of &euro;3,000. Eligible students may have the student contribution fully or partially paid on their behalf under SUSI. </p><p><b>Cost of provision</b></p><p>The estimated cost per student per year is as follows.</p><p>Pharmacy : c.&euro;11,000 - &euro;13,000 per student per year</p><p>Science: c &euro;10,000 - &euro;12,000 per student per year</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-22a.1680.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022200082#WRHH02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 597 and 598 together.</p>  <p>  The Pharmacy Act 2007 conferred responsibility on the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the pharmacy regulator, with respect to pharmacy education and training. The PSI is an independent statutory body and is responsible for defining and ensuring the standards of education and training for pharmacists qualifying in Ireland. This includes developing standards, policies and carrying out accreditation of pharmacy degree programmes.</p>  <p>  In August 2014, the Minister for Health approved changes to the education and training of pharmacists. This change in Pharmacy education has come about because the regulatory body, the PSI, now requires graduates to have completed a Masters degree before entering the PSI Register and practicing as a Pharmacist.</p>  <p>  For those students that commenced their pharmacy course from September 2015, the structure of the pharmacist qualification changed from a four-year Bachelor degree programme followed by a one-year Internship Programme (which resulted in the award of a Level 9 degree) to a five-year fully integrated pharmacy degree programme. </p>  <p>  Under the Department's Free Fees Initiative (FFI), the Exchequer pays tuition fees on behalf of eligible first time undergraduate students attending approved full-time undergraduate courses. In order to qualify for funding under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative, students must meet the criteria of the scheme.</p>  <p>  As referenced above, funding under the FFI is available for undergraduate awards only (up to and including level 8).  In practice, this means that only the undergraduate portion of an integrated masters programme would be eligible for free fees funding. A full tuition fee is payable by all students for any postgraduate/Level 9 award portion of the course of study.</p>  <p>  Separately, SUSI grant support is available for those students who meet the qualifying criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression. Different supports are available to undergraduate and postgraduate students. Qualifying students attending integrated/intercalated courses, will be initially assessed in respect of the undergraduate portion of the course. A separate application will be required in respect of the portion of the course deemed to be the postgraduate element.</p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The total level of fees to be charged for the postgraduate element of an integrated masters course are therefore solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.</p>  <p>  My Department currently has no plans to provide free fees funding for postgraduate years under the FFI therefore the cost of supporting such courses have not been estimated.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I am very conscious of the difficulties that students, like so many others in society, face as a result of the increased costs of living.  For students and their families this includes not just costs such as accommodation and food but also education-specific costs such as postgraduate tuition fees. </p>  <p>  I have already taken significant steps to support learners and their families.  Effective from the start of the next academic year the rate of grant will be increased by &euro;200 for all SUSI recipients, I have widened the thresholds to allow more people to apply for student grants and I have changed the distance thresholds to reflect the increased costs for those who live further away from their colleges. </p>  <p>  I have also put significant additional resources into the Student Assistance Fund, including an additional &euro;1.3 million announced last week, which brings the fund to &euro;18.5m for the current academic year.</p>  <p>  However, the SUSI scheme clearly does not cover everybody, and there are many families who must pay out significant amounts of money each year to continue in third level education. There are different options to address the costs of education and fundamentally these are decisions which must be made in the context of the annual Estimates process.  As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address higher education costs for students in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly across society. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

TU Dublin received a provisional &euro;600,750 in support of the provision of antigen testing to students and this allocation was paid in December 2021 (via the HEA).  This fund is subject to final report and reconcilation to the HEA at the end of this academic year. </p></reply>

Its Climate Ready initiative equips businesses with the practical skills and knowledge to manage the challenges that transitioning to a low-carbon economy presents while a new additional &euro;11m allocation from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve will allow their Business Networks help SMEs plan for success in key areas including digitalisation, sustainability and innovation.</p><p>The Skills to Compete initiative delivered through ETBs, working in tandem with INTREO offices, Regional Skills Fora, and Enterprise Ireland, supports those who have lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19, to re-enter the workforce.  Courses offered are built around three key priorities: delivering the essential skills required for modern workplaces; building strong digital skills; and developing the specific vocational skills to secure opportunities in growing sectors and occupations.  An estimated 21,000 people have benefitted to date.  </p><p>The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship more accessible to employers and learners, to achieve a target of 10,000 annual registrations across a wide range of programmes by 2025. Expanding apprenticeship across all sectors of the economy has widened its impact in areas of skills shortage such as Engineering, Technology Skills, Logistics and FinTech. Under the Plan there will be an increase in online visibility of apprenticeship engagement and apprenticeship development processes for employers/sectors who wish to assess the potential for new apprenticeship development.</p><p>The development of new apprenticeships is employer-led, with consortia comprising employer groups and educational providers coming together to identify a skills need and appropriate apprenticeship responses in their sector. It is open to any industry that wishes to explore such options to bring forward a proposal. Applications for new apprenticeship development are open on an ongoing basis, allowing all employers to progress the development of programmes in response to emerging skills needs on an as-needed basis.</p><p>Springboard+ provides free and subsidised upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills need. The Springboard+ 2022 call for proposals was launched in December 2021 and is expected to launch in Q2 of 2022.  The Human Capital Initiative (HCI) forms a key part of the strategic response to a changing world of work and the challenges the economy will face in the period ahead. With a strong focus on innovation and agility, the programmes being supported will ensure that graduates and the education system as a whole, are in a position to respond positively to the challenges and opportunities ahead. Full details on Springboard+ and HCI courses can be found at  www.springboardcourses.ie.</p><p>Funding of &euro;15m provided 11,597 places on 538 Modular courses in 32 higher education institutions in 2020/21.  Following the success of the 2020 July Stimulus programme a further 4,119 places are being provided on Modular Skills Provision courses during the current academic year.  All courses are shorter and more focused and are offered in a flexible manner, allowing people to gain important skills without taking a considerable period away from the labour market. They represent a new route into lifelong learning, and provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities for those who need it, while ensuring that they remain close to the labour market. </p><p>The Right Course, my Department&rsquo;s one stop shop for businesses, employees and unemployed people, outlines the range of third level options available at <i>www.gov.ie/therightcourse</i>.</p></reply>

Ireland has an advanced system of skills provision, across Further and Higher Education, lifelong learning and human capital development, which is agile and responsive to changes in the world of work, in order to address evolving skills needs. As outlined in the 2021 National Economic Recovery Plan, skills and human capital are important elements in Ireland&rsquo;s broader labour market and economic policy approach, and in allowing Ireland to compete on an international stage and for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).</p><p>The National Skills Council (NSC) and nine Regional Skills Fora (RSF), created under the National Skills Strategy, foster engagement and collaboration between enterprise and the education and training system, and relevant Government Departments and agencies. In developing our skills policy, this partnership approach, including with the enterprise agencies such as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, is key.</p><p>IDA Ireland is represented on each of the Regional Skills Fora. Where needed, the RSF managers work closely with IDA Ireland to address the skills needs of their client companies, including talent attraction and retention and upskilling / reskilling needs of existing employees. Engagement, where relevant, also takes the form of (a) individual IDA client companies being referred to the RSF managers to undertake skills analysis and facilitate introductions with relevant regional education and training providers; (b) IDA Ireland representation on a range of RSF led steering groups/clusters and participation in sectoral studies in collaboration with the RSF managers, for example in areas such as cybersecurity, manufacturing and engineering.</p><p>Looking forward, the OECD Skills Strategy Project, which I launched in November, will greatly assist my Department in its examination of our National Skills Strategy and approach - in order to ensure that we have a solid foundation on which to build Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and support economic and social sustainability into the future. The RSF are a key engagement platform throughout the OECD project, leveraging their existing networks to engage with large and small enterprises across Ireland and to ensure alignment at regional and national level in relation to skills issues.</p><p>Regarding the breakdown of the Regional Skills Fora network, the RSF cover the following nine regions:</p><p>Dublin &ndash; Dublin</p><p>Mid East &ndash; Kildare, Meath, Wicklow</p><p>Mid West &ndash; Clare, Limerick, Tipperary (North)</p><p>Midlands &ndash; Laois, Longford, Offaly, Westmeath</p><p>North East &ndash; Cavan, Louth, Monaghan</p><p>North West &ndash; Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo</p><p>South East &ndash; Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary (South), Waterford, Wexford</p><p>South West &ndash; Cork, Kerry</p><p>West &ndash; Galway, Mayo, Roscommon  </p><p>Contact information for each Regional Skills Fora manager is provided below.</p><p>Dublin &ndash; Natasha Kinsella (natashakinsella@regionalskills.ie)</p><p>Mid East &ndash; Siobh&aacute;n Keogh (siobhankeogh@regionalskills.ie)</p><p>Mid West &ndash; Joe Leddin (joeleddin@regionalskills.ie)</p><p>Midlands &ndash; John Costello (jcostello@regionalskills.ie)</p><p>North East &ndash; Ray Murphy (raymurphy@regionalskills.ie)</p><p>North West &ndash; Hilary McPartland (hilarymcpartland@regionalskills.ie)  </p><p>South East &ndash; Edmond Connolly (edmondconnolly@regionalskills.ie)</p><p>South West &ndash; Siobhan Bradley (siobhanbradley@regionalskills.ie)</p><p>West &ndash; Denise Rocks (deniserocks@regionalskills.ie)</p></reply>

As the Department of Social Protection state pension payment was not increased in Budget 2021, the special rate income threshold remains at &euro;24,500 for the 2022 Scheme. The income threshold for the special rate of grant is strategically aligned with the highest Department of Social Protection rate as described in order to target students from households in receipt of long term social welfare assistance effectively. However, the special rate of grant payment itself was increased by &euro;200 as part of Budget 2022, along with all other student grant rates. For the 2022/23 academic year, the special rate of grant is payable at the non-adjacent rate of &euro;6,115 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,575, depending on the distance from ordinary residence to the college attended. Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Combatting it is, and will continue to be, a priority for this Government.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has committed significant resources to the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking in Ireland. A specialised Garda Unit, the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU), has been in place since 2009 to conduct investigations into human trafficking. It also provides advice, support and where necessary, operational assistance to investigations at district level. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also active in relation to trafficking gangs through work targeting organised crime - targeting their finances, their use of the internet and by working closely with other jurisdictions.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table shows the number of identified victims of human trafficking in the State in 2021 and the reason for their trafficking. <table>    <tr>       <th>Category  </th>       <th>Total </th>       <th>Female </th>       <th>Male </th>       <th>Children </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sex trafficking </td>       <td>25 </td>       <td>24 </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Forced labour </td>       <td>19 </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>15 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Forced criminality </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Unspecified exploitation </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>44 </td>       <td>28 </td>       <td>16 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I can assure the Deputy that this Government is serious about preventing and prosecuting for human trafficking, and committed to supporting those that are victims of it. We are confident that the victim-centred policy approach we are taking will encourage more victims to come forward and access supports and that this will, in turn, strengthen prosecutions and convictions.</p><p>Last year Government approved proposals to revise the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) to make it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, be identified and access advice, accommodation and support.</p><p>The revised NRM will provide for all agencies, both State and civil society, to co-operate, share information about potential victims, identify those victims and facilitate their access to advice, accommodation and support.</p><p>The new approach acknowledges various state bodies and NGOs have a role in identifying victims of human trafficking and referring them to the NRM. </p><p>We want to be sure that every victim of trafficking is identified and helped so we can support them. Doing this will also help us gather more information and evidence in order to bring to justice the traffickers who prey on vulnerable people with no regard for the lives and safety of their victims. </p><p>In addition, the development of a new National Action Plan on human trafficking is taking place. A consultant has produced a short and focussed analysis of the current position in relation to human trafficking in Ireland. The analysis includes a research review, a synopsis of the extent of trafficking in Ireland and a summary of issues to address. </p><p>The Department of Justice is now engaged with a working group to draft the new National Action Plan high-level goals and outcomes. </p></reply>

The IPS recognises women as a particularly vulnerable group with very different needs to male offenders and is working constantly to address those needs, including by reference to the Bangkok Rules. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the D&oacute;chas Centre is the principal location for the accommodation of female prisoners in the State. The ethos under which D&oacute;chas operates is that the women live together in a community-style setting, accommodated in houses rather than cell block. The regime focuses on training and rehabilitation, including access to mental health services, psychology service and addiction counsellors.  </p>  <p>  My officials in the Irish Prison Service report that communal dining is available to women prisoners in certain areas in Limerick Prison but that prisoners are permitted to dine in by themselves or with their cell mate. In the D&oacute;chas Centre the women are accommodated in houses rather than cell blocks and most prefer to dine in their houses and rather than communally.</p>  <p>  The new specially designed accommodation block for women offenders in Limerick, which will replace the use of the female wing at that prisons, is expected to be completed and become operational in the latter half of this year. The design of the new facility is centred on the principle of rehabilitation and normalisation, reflecting contemporary design standards.  A mix of accommodation units is being provided based around an external courtyard setting and the development will provide accommodation for 50 female prisoners.</p>  <p>  I understand that staff working with women in prison are provided with specialist training and in February 2020 the Prison Service introduced a new tailored programme for staff to address the special needs of women prisoners.  To enhance the rehabilitative opportunities, a new programme called the Outlook Programme, which is a step down unit for women offenders, was opened in 2019 in partnership with the Probation Service. The project is managed by Focus Ireland and the vision of the programme is to promote the rehabilitation and re-integration of women leaving prison, in particular those who have accommodation needs requiring support in the community.</p>  <p>  Privacy is afforded to all prisoners for various activities, where appropriate, including phone calls and contact with their children.  The Prison Service is acutely aware of the importance of assisting prisoners to maintain close contact with their children while in custody. The Deputy will be aware that in order to protect the prison population from the risk of Covid-19, a number of infection control measures were introduced throughout 2020 and 2021. Regrettably, this included the suspension of physical visits to prisoners for extended periods of time. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that following a short two week suspension physical visits recommenced in all prisons on Monday 24 January and prisoners are entitled to receive one physical visit per fortnight. In addition, from 14 February the number of persons permitted to visit a prisoner increased to three persons, of whom two may be a child (under 18 years of age).  Visits will continue to be subject to infection control measures including the wearing of face masks. </p>  <p>  The Prison Service introduced a new video visit system to ensure that prisoners could continue to have visual contact with their families throughout this time.</p>  <p>  Limerick Prison has a Tusla approved and award winning visitors area and the Prison Service work closely with care workers, the courts and Tusla to provide access visits where appropriate.</p></reply>

Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including operational decisions and the deployment of resources to address drug crime. As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. </p><p>Methylamphetamine is a controlled drug as per the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 to 2015. I am advised by the Garda authorities that the usage of Methylamphetamine in Ireland at this time is quite low, resulting in a low volume of seizures. In line with the National Drug and Alcohol Strategy 2017 - 2025, <i>Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery</i>, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along with its partner agency, the Revenue Commissioners Customs Service, continues to target Organised Crime Groups (OCGs) involved in the illegal import, export, and sale and supply of controlled drugs, including Methylamphetamine, in this jurisdiction. </p><p>Under Action 3.2.36 of the National Drug and Alcohol Strategy 2017 - 2025, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue Commissioners Customs Service are the lead agencies on an action relevant to monitoring drug markets, new drug markets, and both the surface and dark web. I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are represented on the Early Warning and Emerging Trends Sub Committee, which advises government on new psychoactive substances, emerging trends and practices and the consequences of such drug use. This group is led by the Department of Health in association with the European Monitoring Centre for Drug and Drugs Addiction (EMCDDA).  </p><p>I am assured by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to monitor drug trends in line with the EU Early Warning System and will consider the implications of any new or existing trend in the Irish drug market, including Methylamphetamine. </p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p><p>In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p><p>However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p><p>Last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, the highest level achieved since 2015.  Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022.</p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: <i>INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie</i>, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. </p><p>Methylamphetamine is a controlled drug as per the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 to 2015. I am advised by the Garda authorities that the usage of Methylamphetamine in Ireland at this time is quite low, resulting in a low volume of seizures. In line with the National Drug and Alcohol Strategy 2017 - 2025, <i>Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery</i>, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along with its partner agency, the Revenue Commissioners Customs Service, continues to target Organised Crime Groups (OCGs) involved in the illegal import, export, and sale and supply of controlled drugs, including Methylamphetamine, in this jurisdiction. </p><p>Under Action 3.2.36 of the National Drug and Alcohol Strategy 2017 - 2025, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue Commissioners Customs Service are the lead agencies on an action relevant to monitoring drug markets, new drug markets, and both the surface and dark web. I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are represented on the Early Warning and Emerging Trends Sub Committee, which advises government on new psychoactive substances, emerging trends and practices and the consequences of such drug use. This group is led by the Department of Health in association with the European Monitoring Centre for Drug and Drugs Addiction (EMCDDA).  </p><p>I am assured by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to monitor drug trends in line with the EU Early Warning System and will consider the implications of any new or existing trend in the Irish drug market, including Methylamphetamine. </p></reply>

Last year &euro;10 million of funding for new service developments provided for 125 additional whole time equivalents to provide for both increased frontline ambulance staffing and equipment capacity and for enhanced NAS community initiatives designed to reduce acute hospital attendances and improve patient experiences.  This year out of an unprecedented total allocation of &euro;200 million, a further &euro;8.2 million is being invested in new developments which will help to build more capacity into the service. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to be aware that a new five-year NAS Strategic Plan is currently being finalised by the HSE. This plan, elements of which have been funded in Budget 2022, will be supported by the findings and recommendations of a National Demand and Capacity Analysis, which has been commissioned by the NAS to inform future capacity requirements and workforce planning to 2027.

Detention of any person without consent is a serious matter that it can only happen in accordance with the law &ndash; in this case, the Mental Health Act 2001. </p>  <p>  Where a person is in the community, the process of involuntary detention under the 2001 Act is a three-step process. The first step requires an application, (which can be made by a spouse or relative, an authorised officer, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or any other person, subject to conditions set out in section 9(2) of the Act), followed by a recommendation by a GP that the person is suffering from a mental disorder and would benefit from a period of treatment in hospital.  The third step is the requirement that the consultant psychiatrist, following an assessment, diagnoses the person as suffering from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 3 of the Act, and authorises the involuntary admission of the person. Upon admission of a patient on an involuntary basis, a second examination by an independent consultant psychiatrist takes place to affirm or refuse the order.</p>  <p>  It is also important to mention that in addition to the requirement to follow clear admission statutory procedures, the Act also gives every detained person the right to automatically have their involuntary admission reviewed. This means that such admissions must be reviewed by a Mental Health Tribunal made up of three independently appointed persons.  If the Mental Health Tribunal believes that the procedures for involuntary admission followed the law and that the person is suffering from a mental disorder, their decision will be to affirm the admission or renewal order.  If, however, the Mental Health Tribunal decides that the criteria for detention are not fulfilled, the Tribunal will direct that the person be discharged. A lawyer is also appointed by the Mental Health Commission to represent the detained person, free of charge, at the Mental Health Tribunal hearing. The person may continue to stay in hospital as a voluntary patient, if that is their choice and further treatment is indicated.  However, if they do not wish to remain, they must be discharged.</p>  <p>  Under Section 28 of the Act, the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the care and treatment of an involuntary person must ensure that they are not inappropriately discharged and that they are detained only for so long as is reasonably necessary for their proper care and treatment.</p>  <p>  I should also add that it is important to point out that it is only people who have been diagnosed as having a mental disorder that can be detained under the 2001 Act.</p>  <p>  In addition to the present safeguards in the 2001 Act, I am pleased to say that a General Scheme of a Bill to amend the 2001 Act, based on the recommendations of an Expert Group Review of the Act, is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas.  The General Scheme was drafted following extensive consultation with key stakeholders, including the Mental Health Commission, the HSE, the College of Psychiatrists, and the Ombudsman for Children, and in light of the findings of a 2021 public consultation which received 100 submissions. The Scheme considers relevant legislation such as the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under international human rights instruments, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  The intention of the changes proposed will be to strengthen the safeguards of persons liable to detention under the Act and ensure that the Act fully respects the autonomy of individuals who have capacity to make their own decisions regarding treatment.  These changes and others, when included in revised mental health legislation, will further improve the protections available to mental health service users.</p>  <p>  As the specific question the Deputy has raised is a service matter in relation to an individual case, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible on this matter.</p></reply>

At present all children up to and including the age of 5 are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p><p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under in three phases: to children aged 6 and 7; to children aged 8 and 9; and to children aged 10,11 and 12. Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7. My officials and the HSE are already engaged in preparatory work, and I expect to be in a position to bring forward proposals to the IMO, representing GPs, later this quarter, after which engagement can commence with the IMO. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

The Mater Hospital was designated as the MTC for the Central Trauma Network by Government in April 2021.</p>  <p>  The National Office for Trauma Services continues to engage stakeholders in the RCSI Hospital Group, Ireland East Hospital Group, National Neurosurgical Centre (NNC) at Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital regarding the provision of neurosurgical services in the MTC at the Mater Hospital. </p>  <p>  The National Office for Trauma Services has advised that a meeting was held in December 2021 between senior clinicians from the Mater Hospital and the NNC at Beaumont Hospital, to develop a clinical model of care for neurotrauma in the MTC.  A Clinical Advisory Group has been established to progress an integrated model of care for neurotrauma / neurocritical care services for the MTC, involving collaboration between the MTC at the Mater Hospital and the NNC at Beaumont Hospital.

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly.  </p>  <p>  It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p></reply>

Budget 2022 secured funding for up to an additional 10,000 WTE, reflecting the level of ambition and desire to invest in our health services.  However, there are a range of targets set out in the draft National Service Plan. The targeted recruitment for this year continues to address any identified staff shortages across grades and service areas.</p>  <p>  Discussions between the Department and HSE officials agreed that, due to the current challenging recruitment environment, 5,500 WTE is a more achievable target for 2022. The upper affordable limit of 10,000 WTE is not seen as undeliverable, but rather one that will be ambitious and challenging to achieve, given the risks affecting labour supply. It is worth noting that these recruitment targets are additional WTE and do not include the replacement of existing staff who retire/leave during the year.</p>  <p>  The HSE identified the more realistic recruitment target of 5,500 WTE alongside a more challenging &lsquo;stretch&rsquo; target of 10,000 WTE set out in the National Service Plan. The Department has been working closely with the HSE to assess potential savings and further decisions on how this funding will be used will be taken.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-22a.2000.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022200087#WRNN04100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 703 and 710 together.</p><p>The Department of Health and the HSE work closely together to manage the health service and, through Sl&aacute;intecare, implement the much-needed reform to deliver a better health service for the public. </p><p>  This working relationship, characterised by mutual respect, is professional and constructive. However, it is widely acknowledged that there are many legacy issues across the health service to be addressed. As you may be aware, core elements of the HSE&rsquo;s financial system at local level are still a reported under the former Health Board system - the HSE, my Department, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have prioritised the modernisation of the HSE&rsquo;s financial reporting systems. </p><p>  My officials are supporting the HSE on an overall Finance reform programme to enhance the financial reporting capability of the HSE. The HSE has already undertaken substantial internal work on this issue, and, with the active engagement and support of my Department, the HSE is working to deliver a new modern integrated financial reporting system to address the issues associated with current legacy systems. This project will progressively deliver significant enhancements to financial reporting and streamline procurement processes as it is rolled out across the HSE system and the larger Section 38 and Section 39 health providers. </p><p>  My Department and the HSE are not just focused on longer term projects to deliver new systems. Both agencies are also working together in close cooperation on making interim enhancements to the HSE's financial reporting capabilities, which in turn enable my Department to provide timely updates to a range of stakeholders including Government, the Health Budget Oversight Group and the Parliamentary Budget Office.  </p><p>  In this regard, I would highlight the work undertaken by the HSE Finance Team with support from Department of Health officials over the past two years to make a series of interim financial reporting improvements, within the constraints of current legacy systems focused on a shared understanding and reporting around the HSE&rsquo;s financial position. For example, new monthly working capital reports and weekly detailed COVID-19 expenditure reporting. These enhancements are welcomed by the Department. However, this is much more to be done in this area and it will be continue to be a key priority for both agencies to work cooperatively to deliver further improvements within the constraints of current systems ahead of the implementation of new systems. </p><p>  It is also important to highlight the role of the Health Budget Oversight Group. This group is a monthly engagement which forms part of the overall financial management and governance process between the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p><p>  I am aware that a Sunday newspaper has published a number of unverified statements on Sunday 13th February and Sunday 20th February. These statements are based on comments alleged to have been made by officials in my Department which the newspaper reports that it has extracted from alleged recordings of private internal discussions within the Department. You will appreciate that my Department has not been afforded access to these alleged recordings which therefore constrains my ability to verify the matters reported or to comment constructively further.  </p><p>  However, it is clear that any alleged recordings which may have been obtained are unverified, and were made without the consent or knowledge of the participants in breach apparent breach of privacy rights of the individuals concerned, and as such the reported remarks self-evidently do not represent the formal position of either myself as Minister for Health nor indeed of the Department of Health.  </p><p>  I would like to put on record my more general concern - in relation to the appropriateness of the reporting by the Sunday Business Post in printing alleged unverified and casual comments attributed to named officials which were allegedly obtained from recordings of private discussions obtained without the consent or knowledge of the participants concerned. There is an important principle at stake here where we must protect the right of our public servants to engage in private and at times necessarily robust discussions. </p><p>This is an essential and appropriate part of the deliberative process engaged in by officials and reporting alleged casual comments of individuals in this way will only serve to limit constructive debate and dialogue across the civil service and this is damaging to the public interest. </p><p>  However, it is important to also put on record that the fact that a number of claims have been reported in these two newspaper articles which I referred to above are in fact wholly inaccurate. </p><p>  We have clarified these matters in various other fora and I have taken the opportunity to set out the correct factual position in relation to these matters here also:</p><p>- The Sunday Business Post reported on 13th February and 20th February that the HSE sought just &euro;10m in additional funding for mental health last year. That is untrue. The actual figure sought from the HSE was &euro;35m.</p><p>- The newspaper speculated that a prior HSE adjustment could run to hundreds of millions. The HSE has noted that is untrue. The HSE have stated that any adjustment will be of a technical nature and be less than &euro;100m. It is as yet unclear whether the HSE will require to make an adjustment in respect to its 2021 financial statements in respect of previous years accounts.</p><p>- The report focused on targets for recruitment. Budget 2022 secured funding for up to 10,000 additional staff. We want to hire these and while we should be ambitious, the HSE has said 5,500 is more realistic. However, we will strive to do better and the money is there. The newspaper spoke about so-called fake recruitment targets. This is a complete misrepresentation of the actual position and fails to detail that more than 12,500 healthcare staff have been hired (net) over the past two years.</p><p>- On Sunday 20th February, the Sunday Business Post newspaper appears to be suggesting that some &euro;30m given in funding to palliative care providers (hospices) and disability providers is questionable. We fully back the decision to support these organisations. </p><p>- There is a claim in the Sunday Business Post on Sunday 20th February that an additional hospital will require more staff. That&rsquo;s self-evident to most people. We absolutely need more hospital beds. We have far fewer beds per 100,000 population than our EU neighbours. Of course public representatives from Limerick and elsewhere will look for additional capacity -the Government has plans to develop additional elective facilities in Dublin, Cork and Galway. </p><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and for the opportunity to set out the actual position on a number of the matters that have been reported.</p></reply>

The Agreement included provisions covering incremental credit that would result in consultants commencing at different points on the scale.</p>  <p>  The LRC specifically proposed within the Agreement that incremental credit be available up to the 6th point of the salary scales. It recommended that the parties establish a Committee to develop a framework for the application of incremental credit which would take into account relevant and appropriate service and qualifications. The LRC also proposed the membership of the Committee and  recommended, that in addition to the framework, the Committee would set the policy and determine how incremental credit would be recognised in such exceptional cases as arise.  In addition, the Agreement also provided that Business Cases could be submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in exceptional cases seeking sanction for appointment beyond the 6th point of the scales.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform formally sanctioned the provisions of the Agreement and specifically the Incremental Credit proposals within the Agreement on 29th January 2015. Sanction from the Minister for Health issued to the HSE on 3rd February 2015.</p>  <p>  The HSE circulated the finalised Framework, developed and agreed by the Committee within the LRC's parameters, to all relevant personnel, hospitals, CHO's and agencies on 15 September 2015. This was followed by a FAQ Guidance Note on 28th September 2015.</p>  <p>  Taking account of the recognition given to relevant service and additional qualifications within the Incremental Credit Framework it would be expected that many consultants would not commence at the starting point of the salary scale. </p></reply>

However, there are a range of targets set out in the draft National Service Plan. The targeted recruitment for this year continues to address any identified staff shortages across grades and service areas.</p>  <p>  Discussions between the Department and HSE officials agreed that, due to the current challenging recruitment environment, 5,500 WTE is a more achievable target for 2022. The upper affordable limit of 10,000 WTE is not seen as undeliverable, but rather one that will be ambitious and challenging to achieve, given the risks affecting labour supply. It is worth noting that these recruitment targets are additional WTE and do not include the replacement of existing staff who retire/leave during the year.</p>  <p>  The HSE identified the more realistic recruitment target of 5,500 WTE alongside a more challenging &lsquo;stretch&rsquo; target of 10,000 WTE set out in the National Service Plan. The Department has been working closely with the HSE to assess potential savings and further decisions on how this funding will be used will be taken. Actual recruitment will, as always, be monitored by the HSE and the Department throughout the course of the year under the governance and oversight arrangements in place.</p></reply>

Certain regions are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability. </p>  <p>  I am committed to establishing a cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group to examine strategic workforce challenges, including recruitment and retention of workers, in front-line carer roles in home support and nursing homes.   This will include those home support workers providing support to those with Alzheimer's.</p>  <p>  The work of this Group will centre on engagement with the relevant stakeholders in the sector.  To this end, a 'Call for Submissions' was issued by my Department to relevant stakeholders in December 2021.  Following receipt of these completed submissions in January, my Department undertook a short-life scoping exercise to gather initial data and evidence on the nature and extent of the challenges in the sector to inform the structure and membership of this cross-departmental Group.</p>  <p>  This scoping exercise is now complete and invitations to join the Group, along with its draft Terms of Reference, have been issued to all relevant Government Departments and agencies.  The inaugural meeting of the Group will be held in the week beginning 28th February 2022. </p>  <p>  At this meeting, the Terms of Reference for the Group and action timelines will be agreed. These Terms of Reference will be published once finalised by the Group.</p>  <p>  This Group will then progress a structured programme of ongoing consultative engagements with key sectoral stakeholders to further explore and define the issues, listen to stakeholder views, and identify approaches to respond to the strategic workforce challenges.</p>  <p>  The Group will provide a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address the workforce challenges in the sector and develop a report for my consideration outlining the Group&rsquo;s key findings, recommendations, and a proposed action plan to support implementation of these recommendations to include periodic monitoring of progress.</p>  <p>  Potential areas to be considered by the Group include recruitment, retention, training, and the career development of front-line carers in home support and nursing homes into the future.  It is also expected that pay and conditions for these workers will be examined.  Without pre-empting the outcomes of the work of the Group, the buddy system mentioned by the Deputy may emerge as a solution to address the challenges in the sector, however it is too soon to say at this time.</p></reply>

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects. Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health.</p>  <p>  As a result of the increasing prevalence of medicines shortages globally, there has been significant interest at European level in this area, including a task force on medicines availability to identify and address issues linked to the disruption of supplies of medicines. Ireland, through my Department and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, continues to contribute to these efforts at a European level to consider initiatives to minimise the risk and disruption to patient safety and care, and the impact on healthcare professionals, caused by medicine shortages. As well, colleagues within the Department continue to engage with their counterparts in Northern Ireland in order to better address health concerns across the island.</p>  <p>  At a national level, Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicines shortages framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur. The HPRA have been notified of intermittent supply challenges involving HRT medicines that have been ongoing for some months. These supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for theses products in Ireland in recent years. The HPRA continues to engage with the companies involved to mitigate the impact of the shortages.</p>  <p>  In the case of medicines used most often in Ireland, there are typically multiple brands and/or generic medicines available from a range of sources. In the event that supply issues arise for individual medicines, different options, including alternative brands or generic medicines, should be made available to ensure continuity of treatment. If the patient has concerns, they should discuss their treatment and alternative options with their doctor, pharmacist or other healthcare professional.</p></reply>

The Chief Inspector of Social Services, in the context of HIQA functions under the Health Act 2007 as amended, had brought concerns to the CEO's attention.  The Chief Inspector is an independent statutory function responsible for the registration and inspection of designated centres, including those for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Chief Inspector has instigated a regulatory programme requiring the HSE to take action to improve the quality of life for residents of designated disability centres and regulatory compliance. HIQA is monitoring the progress of the HSE.  </p>  <p>  The progress on the steps being taken by HIQA the regulator, and the response by the HSE to address the safeguarding and governance concerns in adult disability services in CHO1, is being monitored by the Department of Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for Disabilities, Minister Rabbitte.  </p>  <p>  Minister Rabbitte, with the Department of Health and HSE, is actively considering and scoping what might be done to further enhance safeguarding in residential care in the area.</p>  <p>  The findings of HIQA&rsquo;s regulatory programme, and the work of the HSE in this regard in CHO1, will be considered and learnings may inform safeguarding policy more generally as appropriate.  It is important, however, to allow the work underway to progress.  The ultimate aim is to ensure that services are safe for clients and that those working in the services are appropriately supported.</p>  <p>  Work is currently underway by the Department of Health in developing a national policy on adult safeguarding in the health and social care sector, which includes disability services. The intention of this Policy development is to enhance / strengthen the health and social care sector&rsquo;s wider adult safeguarding framework.</p>  <p>  The delivery of high-quality safe services for adults with a disability in CHO1 is of the highest priority.  All steps being taken to provide assurance of this is to be welcomed.</p></reply>

According to HIQA, the majority of providers make notifications to the Chief Inspector within the required timeframe. In cases where notifications are not made on time, this is identified as a regulatory non-compliance and the provider is required to take action to ensure they meet the requirements of the regulations.  </p>  <p>  A report on each HIQA inspection, which includes information on compliance with regulations, is published by the Authority on its website &ndash; www.hiqa.ie.

The Healthy Ireland Strategic Action Plan builds on the success of the Healthy Ireland Framework, which was published in 2013. The Action Plan contains 56 strategic actions across six themes which will be implemented over the lifetime of the plan. It takes a &quot;whole of government&quot; and &quot;whole of society&quot; approach, and each action has a lead government department from across fourteen separate government departments. </p><p>One of the strategic actions under Theme 2, &quot;Partnerships and Cross-Sectoral Work&quot;, is to &quot;<i>Engage and collaborate with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to align policy and initiatives with Healthy Ireland policy</i>&quot;.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH)  is represented on both the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group and the National Physical Activity Plan Implementation Group (NPAP IG).  The Department of Health also collaborates with DHLGH in other fora, such as the Town Centre First interdepartmental advisory group.</p><p>An Implementation Action under the strategic action referred to above is &quot;<i>Implementation of the commitment to use planning to address the obesogenic environment</i>&quot;.  Due to other priorities, progress has not been made in this area since the publication of the Strategic Action Plan.  In 2022, the Department will work with the lead Department, DHLGH, and other stakeholders to progress work in this complex area.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p><p>Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p><p>My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:</p><p>- girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and</p><p>- women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p><p>If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.</p></reply>

In doing so, it also provides for a scheme of registration and inspection of residential services for older persons (nursing homes), persons with disabilities and children in need of care and protection. HIQA's functions include the setting of standards on safety and quality in respect of these residential services and the Chief Inspector of Social Services monitors compliance with standards and regulations.</p><p>In accordance with Section 2 of the Health Act 2007 and Section 2 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, premises in which a majority of the residents are members of a religious order or are priests of any religion (religious institutions), are exempted from the provisions of the 2007 Act as they are not &lsquo;designated centres&rsquo; as defined in the Act. In the context of the 1990 Act at the time of its passing in the Oireachtas, careful consideration was given to striking a balance between facilitating those religious communities that specialise in providing nursing home care to priests or members of religious orders and excluding those communities that care for their older members within the rules of their religious founders. As such, only a nursing home run by a religious community caring for dependent persons who are in receipt of a subvention from a health board, as it was at that time, was included in the regulatory framework. The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 also only recognises registered nursing homes in the context of State support under that Act. </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has identified substantial learning in the context of nursing home services, including the supporting regulatory framework, which requires review.  Minister Donnelly and I have determined a phased approach to examining the legislation with a view to enhancing the nursing home regulatory model. Phase 1 is bringing forward interim legislative enhancements aimed at making initial improvements to the regulatory framework. This work is ongoing in my Department and is the priority focus in terms of regulatory reform. The Government included a Health (Amendment) Bill on its legislative agenda, aimed at legislative amendments to enhance the oversight and regulation of nursing homes.</p><p>Phase 2 will be a wider, root-and-branch review of the nursing home regulatory model, incorporating best practices and guidance established through both a national and international evidence review of nursing home regulatory models. On completion of phase 1, my Department will establish a process for the phase 2 wider review of the regulatory model underpinning nursing homes. To facilitate planning for this, my Department will undertake a scoping exercise in the second half of 2022 to determine the scope of phase 2 of the review. I will ask my officials to consider the issue of religious orders in the context of this scoping work to determine if the issue can be examined in the wider review.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>&euro;350m is being allocated in 2022 to the HSE and the NTPF to primarily provide additional public and private activity to further stabilise and reduce scheduled care waiting lists and waiting times in tandem with bringing forward much needed longer-term reforms. This will supplement the core activity of the HSE as detailed in the HSE National Service Plan (NSP) 2022.</p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, which will be launched shortly, builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly. This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. It has produced a comprehensive 2022 waiting list action plan which will set out high-level targets for waiting list improvement including dedicated funding for service reform, patient pathway improvement, and important significant additionality to substantially reduce the backlog of patients waiting. The taskforce will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious Multi-Annual Waiting List Plan, which is currently under development in my Department. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come. </p><p>The data requested by the Deputy regarding the Endoscopy waiting list at University Hospital Kerry is outlined in the attached document which provides the waiting list for G.I.Scopes by time band on 27 Jan 2022. This information is also available on the NTPF website at: </p><p>G.I.

While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List. The clinical suitability of the patient to avail of NTPF funded treatment is determined by the public hospital.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, the NTPF has outlined in the attached tables, the number of GI Scope treatments arranged for patients on the GI waiting list at University Hospital Kerry (UHK) and the numbers of patients treated through insourcing and outsourcing in 2020 and 2021. The NTPF has advised that to date in 2022, no GI Scope treatments have been arranged for patients on the UHK GI waiting list.</p><p>In terms of activity, in 2020 136 GI Scopes were arranged through insourcing activity, with 124 patients treated. There was no outsourcing activity for GI Scopes in 2020. In 2021 treatment for 321 patients was arranged through insourcing, with 262 patients treated, while treatment for 215 patients was arranged through outsourcing, with 200 patients treated. This information is set out in the attached table, provided to my Department by the NTPF.</p><p>The NTPF has advised that a difference between the number of treatments arranged and the number of patients treated arises as patients can decline offers of treatment for a number of reasons, including because they want to remain with the public hospital, they are not clinically suitable for treatment, they no longer require treatment, or have been treated.</p><p>In 2020 &euro;108,800 was paid to UHK for insourced GI Scope activity, while in 2021 &euro;256,800 was paid to UHK for insourced scope activity. The NTPF has advised my Department that under outsourcing arrangements the NTPF pays the private hospitals directly and as such there is no funding allocated to the public hospitals themselves. <table>    <tr>       <th>Insourcing Funding by year</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Amount of Funding Provided</td>       <td>&euro;108,800.00</td>       <td>&euro;256,800.00</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>GI CANs Issued to University Hospital Kerry 2020</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Treatments Arranged</td>       <td>No. of patients treated</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Insourcing</td>       <td>136</td>       <td>124</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Outsourcing</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>136</td>       <td>124</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>GI CANs Issued to University Hospital Kerry 2021</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Treatments Arranged</td>       <td>No. of patients treated</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Insourcing</td>       <td>321</td>       <td>262</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Outsourcing</td>       <td>215</td>       <td>200</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>536</td>       <td>462</td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <td>CAN = Case Authorisation Number - Authorisation for Treatment issued by NTPF</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p>  <p>  Under the Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. </p>  <p>  While there are no plans currently to extend the list of conditions covered, the LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs. </p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than &euro;100 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The maximum payable under the Drugs Payment Scheme will be further reduced to &euro;80 per month from 1 March 2022. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. </p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. </p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

The claims received are a combination of new claims i.e. claims that were not the subject of proceedings before the High Court, and claims transferred from the High Court.</p><p>On 24 January 2022, I made an order under the CervicalCheck Tribunal Act 2019 to extend the closing date for receipt of claims by the Tribunal to 26 July 2022. The Act does not provide for a further extension of this date (i.e. post July 2022). The Tribunal has successfully brought a number of claims to conclusion swiftly and I am confident it can continue to do so. </p><p>The Tribunal implements in full the recommendations of Mr Justice Meenan in his report as an alternative system to the courts for eligible women.

This frame work which was developed by the National Disability Services, Quality Improvement Team in 2017, outlines the principals and steps that need to be considered when developing a Residents Forum in residential services within an Allocated Service area. This document was widely circulated for use in residential centres. The document can also be adapted when setting up forums in other types of services, for example, day services. </p>  <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s Guidance on the assessment of fitness for designated centres (Jan 2018) states that the provider must demonstrate the governance arrangements they have in place to include a responsive quality assurance framework.  Arrangements should also confirm resident and family forums,.</p>  <p>  Current regulations do not specifically require a registered provider to have a family forum in place, nonetheless, inspectors do look to see that providers engage directly with residents and families in line with residents&rsquo; expressed wishes and consent. In doing so inspectors review:</p>  <p>  - residents care records to ensure that residents and, where appropriate, families, are included in the required reviews of resident care plans- records of complaints received to ensure that issues raised by residents and families are addressed in a timely and appropriate fashion- how residents and families are consulted with in the preparation of the annual review of the quality and safety of resident care.</p>  <p>  Inspectors liaise with residents to hear how they are supported to maintain family and community links based on their wishes. </p>  <p>  Inspectors also engage with residents to discuss their experiences of living in the Centre and how the provider and staff engage with them regarding decisions on how the designated Centre operates.</p></reply>

Under the scope and parameters laid out in the EU DCC Regulation, DCCs for recovery cannot currently be issued on the basis of an antigen test. </p>  <p>  There was very significant demand for PCR testing during December and into January due to unprecedented levels of infection in the community, largely driven by the Omicron variant and reflecting both the high prevalence of the disease and also other respiratory illnesses at the time. The HSE made every effort necessary to address this very significant demand arising for PCR testing. This included making arrangements with private providers to add capacity, extending the opening hours of swabbing centres and ongoing recruitment and redeployment to swabbing teams, and increasing the number of National Ambulance Service mobile teams. </p>  <p>  Due to demands on PCR capacity reaching the levels they did, changes were necessary to public health guidance, making antigen tests more widely available and allowing the HSE to prioritise access to PCR testing for those most vulnerable to the disease.</p>  <p>  Information on travel requirements within Europe is available at the Re-Open EU webpage: reopen.europa.eu/en</p></reply>

HIQA subsequently referred these allegations to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that these referrals were in addition to the measures taken by HIQA requiring the provider to implement actions to ensure the safety of residents. All safeguarding issues are reviewed as a matter of priority to determine the most appropriate regulatory action. In situations where substantiated safeguarding issues are identified, providers are required to take action to ensure the safety of residents. If immediate risks to the safety of residents are identified, providers must take immediate action to address these issues and to prevent a recurrence. </p>  <p>  In all situations, including the six referred to above, the Chief Inspector continues to monitor the actions of the provider to ensure they are effective in addressing the safeguarding concerns. The Chief Inspector can, and has, taken further action, up to and including the cancellation of registration, where providers fail to sustain improvements to residents&rsquo; safety.</p>  <p>  Significant work is ongoing to develop a national policy on adult safeguarding in the health sector.  It is expected that the policy will address, inter alia, appropriate reporting arrangements.  Legislation as required to underpin the policy will be prepared subject to its approval by Government. </p>  <p>  I would like to acknowledge my appreciation for HIQA&rsquo;s participation in and important ongoing contribution to the high-level Steering Group which was established to assist and advise my Department in its development of a national adult safeguarding policy for the health sector and I welcome the Authority&rsquo;s strong support in this regard. </p></reply>

BreastCheck invite this age category because international evidence shows the incidence and mortality from breast cancer in this age group means it is effective to screen women in this age range.  </p><p>The National Screening Service (NSS) also advises that BreastCheck delivers its services in line with international criteria for screening programmes, based on the best international evidence, which they kept under constant review.</p><p>Regarding any further changing or lowering the age eligibility for BreastCheck, it is important to note that any future decisions about changes to our national screening programmes, including reducing the age range in breast screening, will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC). This independent expert group considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria. It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms. </p><p>A dedicated evidence assessment team in HIQA support the work of the NSAC and conduct evidence reviews and evaluations to inform the decisions of the NSAC. The financial cost is but one factor that is considered in the decision-making process. Due to the complex nature of the evaluation process and the criteria against which a decision is made, it would not be possible to accurately quantify the cost of expanding a screening service until a full evidential assessment was completed.</p><p>It may be of interest that the NSAC recently held its first 'Annual Call&rsquo; which gave the public  an opportunity to suggest new screening programmes or modifications to existing ones.I am looking forward to receiving recommendations from the NSAC once they have considered the submissions received, and I will be guided by their advice to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s population-based screening programmes continues to evolve in line with new evidence and developments.</p><p>It is an important message to remind that screening is for healthy people without symptoms.  If anyone becomes aware of symptoms, or if they have concerns or worries, they should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. It is important that every woman is breast aware. This means knowing what is normal for them so that if any unusual change occurs, they will recognise it. The National Screening Service and BreastCheck have useful information in relation to breast health on their website.</p></reply>

Based on updated NCRI analyses, and excluding cases whose mode of presentation was not known, most recently available data shows that emergency presentations accounted for 13.9% of cases diagnosed during 2015-2017. No breakdown of emergency presentation by year is yet available through the NCRI.</p>  <p>The National Cancer Strategy contains recommendations that specifically seek to improve awareness of symptoms. The combined approach of early detection, awareness and education campaigns (with particular focus on those most at risk), and cancer prevention measures will work to reduce the number of cancers presenting as emergencies, as well as ensuring that the public remain informed of lifestyle changes that can reduce their risk of developing cancer.  </p></reply>

All recently qualified nursing graduates were offered permanent contracts of employment in 2020 and 2021. It is expected that the 2022 graduates will also be offered permanent contracts. These nurses and midwives, after one year and 16 weeks' suitable experience, will be eligible to apply for the enhanced nurse-midwife role and salary scale. </p><p>Retention efforts by the HSE both nationally and locally are in place with significant career development and progression and educational/development opportunities being offered. The Department is working with the National Doctors Training and Planning (NDTP) Office of the HSE in relation to medical workforce planning and initiatives aimed at increasing opportunities for training and career progression for trainee doctors.<b></b>Opportunities for training and career progression for doctors in the Irish Health system continue to evolve. Examples of the initiatives include: </p><p>- The Introduction of the online National Employment Record (NER) has now eliminated the requirement for duplication of paperwork associated with NCHD rotations. </p><p>- Enhanced Financial Supports: The Training Support Scheme (TSS), introduced in July 2019, provides reimbursement for approved exams, courses or conferences and is open to all NCHDs. Since July 2019 the full costs of approved examination/courses are eligible for refund to NCHDs under the Clinical Course Exam Refund Scheme (CCERS), this was previously capped at &euro;450. </p><p>- Greater predictability of the location of rotations are now provided to trainees at the outset of training. All newly appointed trainees receive a minimum of 2 years pre-defined rotations, a minimum of 13 weeks prior to commencing training/entry to their training scheme, while trainees entering year 3 of a training scheme receive a minimum of 2 years pre-defined rotations a minimum of 13 weeks prior to commencing year 3 of the scheme. </p><p>- Increased rationalised training opportunities: A number of training schemes are moving towards more a regionalised structure of training. This is specialty dependent, but examples include the intern rotations which take place within a particular intern network and geographic location. </p><p>- Introduction of the Lead NCHD programme: The programme was introduced to provide a formal link at hospital management level between NCHDs and management, and to develop leadership capacity within NCHDs. The programme now runs across 32 acute hospitals, Community Health Organisations (CHOs), Public Health and Primary Care settings. </p><p>- Expansion of supernumerary Flexible Training HSE scheme posts: Since July 2016 the scheme has expanded from 24 to 32 annual places. The scheme has also been extended to junior trainees from year 2 BST onwards; </p><p>- NDTP have recently launched a new E-Portfolio / Logbook accessible to NCHDs via their National Employment Record. The principal objective of the E-Portfolio is to allow NCHDs who are not on a formal training scheme access to a generic standard document to record their training and career development. It also provides the opportunity to have their experience validated by their supervising Consultant where applicable. </p><p>The HSE NDTP Office is in the initial stages of work regarding doctors who completed an internship in Ireland. Early and provisional data shows that a high percentage of medical interns who graduate leave Ireland for at least one year. However, the data shows that 82% of interns who commenced one year intern training in July 2015 subsequently commenced a Basic Specialist Training (BST) or General Practice (GP) training programme in subsequent years (2016-2021). A small number of the 2015 cohort also remain in the Irish health system either in service grade posts or employed within the private healthcare sector. </p></reply>

The Medicines Management Programme (MMP) has submitted a clinical review and the HSE are now considering if there are potential reimbursement options based on the MMPs recommendations. I am hopeful that the HSE can achieve a positive outcome and my Department and the HSE are continuing to work closely together on this issue. </p>  <p>  In order to address the question raised by this PQ, I need to provide an updated position on the classification of Cariban. The position previously presented by me and my Department was based on inaccurate information we received.</p>  <p>My officials recently contacted Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which is the competent authority for medicinal products in Ireland, to seek advice in relation to the classification of Cariban. On 18 February 2022 the HPRA advised my Department that while Cariban does contain Pyridoxine hydrochloride which, as per Directive 2002/46/EC, is permitted for use in the manufacture of food supplements, it also contains doxylamine succinate which is an antihistamine. Therefore, the HPRA has said that Cariban is classified as a medicinal product, not a food supplement. Furthermore, Cariban is classified as a medicinal product as it meets the definition of a medicinal product under Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. </p>  <p>  The HPRA have also advised that Cariban is currently not licensed for use in Ireland. There are three similar products, Xonvea (doxylamine 10 mg and pyridoxine 10 mg), Navalem (doxylamine 10 mg and pyridoxine 10 mg) and Doxylamine/Pyridoxine Exeltis 10 mg/10 mg gastro-resistant tablets (doxylamine 10 mg and pyridoxine 10 mg) that are licensed for use in Ireland.  However, the companies holding the authorisations/licences have not marketed the products in Ireland to date, and the HPRA cannot compel a company to market a medicinal product. Similar to Cariban, all three of these products are classified as medicinal products, not food supplements.  </p>  <p>  I sincerely apologise to the House for presenting information in relation to the classification of Cariban that I now know to be inaccurate. Unfortunately, I only became aware that the information was inaccurate in recent days.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-22a.2537.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022022200096#WRWW06100"><p>Wildfire is an easily preventable threat to our beautiful hills and bogs and the habitats and livelihoods they sustain. Everyone must play their part in protecting our landscapes and supporting our emergency services and ensuring they are not needlessly diverted by illegal fires.</p><p>There is a inherent natural risk of fire in our uplands and on bogs at this time of year, due to the condition of vegetation in these area. Upland grasses, heather and gorse are highly flammable in spring when the weather is dry.  In the right conditions, any ignition, for any reason, can give rise to wildfires. Both landowners and the wider public, whether they are at work or enjoying the countryside, should be mindful of the significant risks of fire at this time of year and be aware of the damage to land and habitats caused by illegal burning and other accidental and unintentional ignitions.  The Department conducts a number of activities annually to monitor and reduce wildfire incidence and outcomes.</p><p>The burning of vegetation is controlled by the Wildlife Acts. It is an offence under Section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 (amended by Section 46 of the Wildlife Act, 2000) to burn, from 1st March to 31st August in any year, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated. Individuals who are found to burn vegetation within that prohibited period are liable to prosecution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).  This Department has no role in regard to prosecutions.</p><p>The Department has issued reminders to all landowners in relation to illegal burning of agricultural lands, and any land found to have been burned illegally can be deemed ineligible across a number of area-based schemes.  The Department monitors fire activity and risk throughout the main risk period between March and September, using a variety of means at our disposal, including satellite detections and ground inspections.</p><p>The Department has also undertaken a number of awareness measures aimed at reducing the level of illegal ignitions, particularly on farmland, and in ensuring that affected sectors are fully prepared for fire outbreaks where these occur. This includes the provision of Fire Danger Rating Notices to relevant sectors and Departments to ensure that the correct level of preparedness is maintained throughout the fire season. The Department also encourages the safe use of fire by land managers during the open burning season, and provides guidance for doing so.</p><p>It is important to note that wildfire ignitions occur from a variety of sources, not just agriculture, and many fires have occurred on lands with no associated agricultural activity, including lands used for turf cutting, and public lands with open access used by the public for recreation. Fires associated with illegal dumping on bogland are a particular problem. In 2021, some of the largest and most problematic fires occurred on non-agricultural land as a result of recreational land user activities and other non-agricultural sources.</p><p>The farming community has a central role to play in the control of fire in our landscapes through the management of land, and the reduction and maintenance of fire prone vegetation (such purple moor grass, heather, and gorse/whin) as potential fuels in high fire risk areas. To this end, the Department supports a number of locally-led schemes under the EIP-AGRI measure that in turn support the implementation of fire management activities on the ground including vegetation management activities. Projects of this type are now in place in many of the main fire risk locations in Ireland, including the Blackstairs Mountains, Wicklow Mountains, McGillicuddy Reeks, Inishowen Peninsula, Connemara, and within the Hen Harrier Project.</p><p>The Hen Harrier project is a results-based project, supported by the Department, covering key habitats across a number of different counties. The project  has recently developed and implemented a number of specific fire management measures including upland grazing management and support, the development of ponds in high risk areas that can provide water for aerial fire fighting operations, and the safe use of fire as a land management tool by landowners. The project also liaises directly with relevant local fire services in areas where it operates. All of the upland projects involve fire management education and awareness building activities directly with landowners through project agricultural advisors and direct inputs from local fire and rescue services and experts from my Department and Teagasc.</p><p>The Department will activate its Fire Danger Rating System in March again for the fire season ahead and this will provide advance warning ahead of high risk weather phases.  I would advise Forest owners and managers to check and update their fire plans and other relevant contingencies such as insurance, firebreaks, access and water points, and private helicopter contracts etc., so as to be prepared well in advance of high fire risk phases. Rural dwellers should also assess wildfire risks to their homes and properties and prepare accordingly. Guidance for this is available from the Office of Emergency Planning &ldquo;<i>Be Summer Ready</i>&rdquo; awareness campaign www.gov.ie/summerready .</p><p>There has been a very significant increase in the use of outdoor amenities and recreation sites by the public since the onset of Covid-19. This is a very welcome development, however forest visitors are reminded not to light fires or use barbeques, to behave responsibly, observe relevant local bye-laws, observe correct physical distancing practice and to park considerately so as not to impede access of emergency vehicles to incidents.</p><p>There is a very firm link in recent years between serious wildfire ignitions and illegal dumping and burning of domestic waste in many areas, and malicious burning at forest amenity sites and turf bogs open to the public. The Department asks all countryside users to be vigilant, to report any suspicious activity to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to report any uncontrolled or unattended fires immediately to the Fire and Emergency Services via 112/999 service. We all have our part to play in protecting our countryside from uncontrolled fires.</p><p>Fire warnings can be accessed at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/642e6-forestry/ and www.teagasc.ie/crops/forestry/forest-fire-risk/</p></reply>

My Department is currently assessing the penalties available under the Act in accordance with the commitment in the current Programme for Government.</p><p>My Department also takes a preventive approach to alleviate welfare concerns for both animals and their owners. In addition to continued and vigorous enforcement of the law, in line with the 'One Health, One Welfare' ethos, my Department is committed to a policy of education and awareness-building in order to prevent animal welfare issues arising. Significant animal welfare related measures have been advanced recently within the scope of our national <i>Animal Welfare Strategy 2021-2025, Working Together for Animal Welfare</i>.

A national shared vision for the future of Ireland's trees and forests and a new Forestry Strategy are currently being developed by Working Group 2 of Project Woodland. This new Forest Strategy will underpin a new Forestry Programme for the period 2023 - 2027.</p>  <p>  The Strategy will be based on a cross-society shared national vision for the role of trees and forests in Ireland. An extensive public consultation process on the new strategy has commenced and will shape this vision. This process will give all stakeholders, communities and citizens in general an opportunity to raise any issues that they feel need to be addressed with my Department. </p>  <p>  A public consultation facility will be available online in the coming weeks to gather informed views from interested members of the public about the draft vision and on the forest strategy and I encourage the organisation named and others to engage in this process. </p>  <p>  The Strategy will be based on a set of clear and implementable actions that support a sustainable forestry industry and delivers multiple benefits for our economy, environment and our communities. </p>  <p>  In parallel with the development of the Forest Strategy an external legal and regulatory review, which will include a comparative analysis of the regulatory system in other counties is nearing completion, and I look forward to sharing the findings of this review with you soon. </p>  <p>  A well-functioning licensing system is of course essential for achieving our afforestation targets While I recognise that the licensing situation still requires our full attention, it is also important to acknowledge that better results were achieved in 2021, with 4,050 licences having been issued, representing an increase of 56% on 2020. A total of 502 afforestation licences issued, facilitating the planting of over 4,255ha. The recently published licensing plan for 2022 sets an ambitious overall target of 5,250 licences, with a focus on increasing the number of afforestation licences.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve the afforestation targets set out in the Climate Action Plan, it is essential to address the broader issue of increasing the level of interest in planting. I am particularly concerned about the low conversion rate to planting. We are currently writing to applicants with unused licences to remind them that their licence is still valid and to encourage them to consider using them before their approval lapses.  It is important that positive messages around planting are communicated and this is the responsibility of all in the sector, especially those in direct contact with farmers and landowners.</p>  <p>  The introduction of an amendment to the Forestry Act 2014 to facilitate small scale tree planting without the need for a licence may appeal to certain landowners and will widen the options available for planting.</p>  <p>  I would also like to note that the national land use review which commenced earlier this year will provide us with information on the optimal land use options and its findings will inform all relevant land use policies.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the delivery of a well-functioning licensing system  which will underpin a new vision for a  multi-functional sustainable forestry model focused on our mutual  economic, environmental and recreational objectives.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Scheme is to encourage Public Bodies to establish new native woodlands on suitable bare land. This aim is consistent with the Programme for Government, which sought to &ldquo;embark on an ambitious programme of afforestation on state-owned lands&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Native woodlands are an important part of Ireland&rsquo;s natural, historical, and cultural heritage, and are unique in terms of their biodiversity. They are home to specialised woodland animals, birds, insects, and plants, including red squirrel, pine marten, great spotted woodpecker, narrow-leaved helleborine and wood millet, to name but a few. </p>  <p>  The Scheme aims to conserve nature by promoting the establishment of permanent non-commercial native woodlands on public land, which can deliver a range of benefits.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Regional Office (CARO) in the Atlantic Seaboard South Region, in partnership with my Department, have carried out a land bank analysis targeted at 300 public bodies in late 2020. This analysis showed that the majority of public bodies are landowners and nearly half of the public bodies that responded to the survey reported that they have land available that might be suitable for the creation of new native woodlands. Following this analysis, CARO have developed a FAQ Guidance document, targeted at Local Authorities in particular, with additional guidance for public bodies in relation to entering and implementing this Scheme. The Guidance document can be downloaded from the CARO website.</p>  <p>  To date there have been 22 applications from public bodies across 12 counties, for 100 ha of forestry.

The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government includes a commitment for a new office of National Food Ombudsman to enforce the EU Directive No. 2019/633 on Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) and to have a role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland. The establishment of the new Office requires primary legislation which my Department is progressing at present. </p>  <p>  In regard to provisions on turnover thresholds in the Directive, one of the objectives of the Directive is to protect smaller suppliers against unfair trading practices by larger buyers. While the Directive provides that Member States may extend those provisions, for example in relation to the turnover thresholds, any such changes in Ireland require primary legislation. </p>  <p>  The UTP Directive was required to be transposed by 1 May 2021.  Therefore, in April 2021, I transposed the Directive into Irish law by way of statutory instrument (SI 198 of 2021). Consequently the Directive was transposed as it stands, without changing the Directive provisions. Ireland was one of only seven Member States to transpose the Directive ahead of the deadline.  At the same time, I established a UTP Enforcement Authority in my Department, as an interim measure, pending the finalisation of the primary legislation. </p>  <p>  Introducing powers to extend the provisions of the Directive is a matter that is being given consideration in the preparation of primary legislation being prepared for the establishment of the new Office.</p>  <p>  In regard to the submissions that were received through the recent public consultation process on the establishment of the new Office, as part of the work to develop the principles and policies underlining the primary legislation all submissions received are being given due consideration.</p>  <p>  In regard to the timing of the completion of the primary legislation, preparations for the General Scheme of the Bill for the primary legislation are well advanced, and I hope to bring a Memorandum to Government on this shortly. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the new Office will bring increased transparency to the agri-food sector and, along with the enforcement of the UTP Directive, that the increased availability of market information will strengthen the position of primary producers and other suppliers in the agricultural and food supply chain.</p></reply>

As the necessary legislation was not enacted within this timeframe, the Commission subsequently adopted an Implementing Decision on 12 June 2018 to suspend interim payments to Ireland under the Programme in respect of Ireland&rsquo;s investment in control and enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy.  As investment in control and enforcement has progressed over the course of the Programme, Ireland has lodged related interim payment claims worth &euro;24.4 million with the Commission and payment of these funds has duly been suspended by the Commission in accordance with its 2018 Implementing Decision.  A further claim due to be lodged shortly may increase this figure to close to &euro;30 million.  Investment remains ongoing and thus the EU funds suspended will ultimately reach the full EMFF allocation to Ireland for control and enforcement of &euro;37.2 million, unless the non-compliance is resolved. Once Ireland has enacted the necessary legislation and put in place the related administrative procedures and resources, the Commission is then required to lift the suspension of payments.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Common Fisheries Policy)(Point System) Regulations (SI No 318/2020) were signed into law in August 2020. These Regulations adopt the requirements of the governing EU Regulations and establish a points system for sea fishing boat licence holders when a serious infringement of the rules of the common fisheries policy is detected within the exclusive fishery limits of the State or for an Irish vessel wherever it may be.  These Regulations partly address the reasons for the suspension.  Separately, the Sea Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, currently before the Oireachtas, also adopts the requirements of the governing EU regulations and in that regard provides for a system of registration and assignment of points to masters of sea fishing boats who are Irish citizens. The enactment of this Bill and its subsequent administrative implementation will facilitate this issue being fully and finally resolved and the related funds released to Ireland. </p></reply>

Both Minister of State Smyth and I are particularly keen to see existing assets and infrastructure leveraged to achieve this, not least in rural and isolated areas.  </p>  <p>  On foot of the initial meeting in December, a series of bilateral discussions have occurred with both state bodies and with representatives of the telecommunications industry. These bilateral meetings, led by senior officials from the two departments, have raised and explored a number of important issues that will be considered by Minister of State Smyth and I in the context of formulating the next work programme of the Taskforce. </p>  <p>It is my intention that the Taskforce will meet again shortly to agree the specific actions which will make up its work plan.   </p></reply>
