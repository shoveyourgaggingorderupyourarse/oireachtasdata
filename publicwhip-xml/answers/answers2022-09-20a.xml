All projects include a community benefit and include a cross-sectoral approach.     The Scheme provides funding for a range of improvements to existing buildings. These include the installation of insulation, heat pump systems, replacement windows/doors, solar Photo-Voltaic technology, energy-efficient lighting, and energy monitors, as well as other energy upgrades. </p>  <p>  Demand for the CEG Scheme has been very strong since the launch of this year&rsquo;s Call for Projects in March. To date, 14 contracts with a grant value of over &euro;35million have been issued by the SEAI (Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland) and a further 12 applications are currently under evaluation within the SEAI. All of which points to a strong pipeline of works under the scheme for the remainder of this year and into 2023.</p>  <p>In addition to the CEG Scheme, there are a range of Government supports for the installation of solar PV are available for homeowners and businesses of all sizes.  </p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 145,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme. Delivering free energy upgrades to low-income households and reducing the waiting times on the Warmer Homes Scheme waiting list is a top priority for me. In order to reduce this timeline to completion and target a monthly average of 400 completions this year, the following actions have already been taken:- The budget, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn of &euro;38 million and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund; </p><p>- SEAI has been allocated additional staff for the Warmer Homes Scheme; </p><p>- SEAI is working to Increase contractor output through active contract engagement and management. </p><p>Latest data provided to my Department by the SEAI indicates that, for homes completed in 2022, the longest time waiting for a survey was 10 months, and the average cycle time from application to completion was 27.5 months. However, cycle times have been affected by COVID related issues. In addition, there are deeper measures being provided under the Scheme since 2018, which involve more substantive works. The average cost per upgrade has increased from &euro;2,300 to &euro;18,753 between 2017 to 2022 reflecting the levels of upgrade now being provided.</p><p>Progress is being made and the latest data on completions per month show that the average number of completions between June and August this year is just under the 400 homes target.</p><p>It is important to note that at the end of 2021, there were just over 7,000 homes on the Better Energy Warmer Homes waiting list. While the number has risen to over 9,000 at the end of August, the majority of these applications were received in the current year. </p><p>I want to see even higher output and reduced waiting times and I have asked the SEAI to redouble its efforts on this key Scheme and will provide every support I can to that end.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-20a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092000059#WRB01200"><p>The underlying principle, and primary advantage of microgeneration is self-consumption of your own electricity. This is how microgeneration can help consumers shield against electricity costs. While there is potential for payment for any excess electricity that you might not use yourself, export is an additional benefit but not the primary driver for engaging in microgeneration.     </p>  <p>  I understand that to the 9th of September 2022 close to 40,000 microgenerators have successfully registered with ESB Networks for an export grid connection. With an average installation size of circa 3 kW, this gives a total of approximately 120 MW of installed microgeneration capacity on the network.    </p>  <p>  Of this, the SEAI has also supported the installation of domestic Solar PV systems for 11,581 homes since 2018, which has resulted in an installed capacity of domestic Solar PV of 45.1 MW. Furthermore, demand has increased significantly in 2022 and we expect that the SEAI will support over 8,000 homes in 2022 alone at a cost of &euro;21m. The SEAI will be extending the Solar PV grant scheme to non domestic applicants for installations up to 6kW by the end of September.  </p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision for the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff which outlines arrangements for implementation of the tariff, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. As part of this, the CRU decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis which must be reflective of the market, or wholesale, value of the electricity, in line with the requirements of Article 21(2)(d) of the recast Renewable Energy Directive.</p>  <p>  Most suppliers have now published their CEG tariffs, which range from &euro;13.5c/kWh up to &euro;20c/kWh which allows customers to shop around and switch suppliers to obtain the best rates for selling and purchasing electricity. </p>  <p>The CRU expects all suppliers to put in place measures to make the first payment to customers at the earliest opportunity and had anticipated that some suppliers may be ready to make the first payment by 31st August 2022, with others indicating that payment measures will be in place by the end of November. This recognises that suppliers require time to develop the necessary systems and processes needed to make payments to customers, following the date that export data was first made available to suppliers by ESB Networks. However, regardless of which supplier you have, micro-generators will not lose out while payment systems are put in place as payments to customers will be backdated to when they either became eligible or to the 15th February 2022.  </p></reply>

This allowed Government to make a payment of &euro;176.22 to domestic electricity accounts between April and May of this year at a total cost of just under &euro;377 million.</p>  <p>  ESBN by virtue of its existing interface with all electricity suppliers, by way of Meter Point Registration Numbers (MPRN), calculated the number of domestic electricity accounts on the relevant date set out in Regulations.</p>  <p>  While the scheme did reach over 2 million domestic electricity accounts, the need to have a MPRN resulted in certain cohorts not being able to access the payment. I am aware that some Traveller families in certain Local Authority accommodations where the MPRN is registered to the Local Authority did not receive the payment. Officials from my Department are in contact with their colleagues in the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government on the matter raised by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This situation is replicated across Europe.   </p>  <p>  The best, long-term approach for Ireland to lower energy prices is to reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels, through investment in indigenous renewable energy sources. The REFIT schemes were designed to encourage renewable electricity generators in Ireland by providing certainty with a minimum price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a 15-year period. Unlike the recent Renewable Electricity Support Scheme contracts, the REFIT contracts do not have a requirement for the repayment to the Public Service Obligation when the wholesale electricity price is higher than the REFIT reference price. </p>  <p>  I attended the Council of Energy Ministers earlier this month where the issue of energy companies making excess profits was discussed in some detail. Energy Ministers invited the European Commission to propose measures aimed at capping the revenues of inframarginal electricity producers with low costs of production. This includes renewable electricity generators with REFIT contracts. </p>  <p>Last Wednesday the Commission published a proposal for a Council Regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. This proposal will assist Government in determining whether and, if so, how a windfall tax and other interventions could be introduced having regard to the overall approach to be adopted at EU level. Officials from my Department continue to work with colleagues across Government on these issues.    </p></reply>

The policy statement provides that, pending the outcome of the review of the energy security of Ireland&rsquo;s gas and electricity systems, it would not be appropriate for the development of any LNG terminals in Ireland to be permitted or proceeded with.    As set out in the National Energy Security Framework, which was published in April 2022, a review of the energy security of Ireland&rsquo;s gas and electricity systems is being carried out by my Department, following which the results will be submitted to Government.  This review is focussed on the period to 2030 and will examine the risks to security of supply and a range of potential mitigating options. The review process includes a technical analysis which will help inform a public consultation. The technical analysis includes identification and examination of the key risks to the security of supply in the electricity and natural gas systems; identification of options that could address or mitigate these risks in the period to 2030; and appraisal of these options in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to 2050. The underlying technical analysis has been updated to take into account the war in Ukraine. </p>  <p>  My Department is carrying our a public consultation as part of the review and I would encourage all interested parties to submit their views in this consultation. </p></reply>

For example, in heavy transport for goods vehicles, or maritime and aviation craft, or as a source for high-temperature heat in industry. Hydrogen storage could also have a significant role to play in power generation as a form of long-term electricity storage, where hydrogen would be used as a backup to renewables to generate electricity during periods of low renewable availability. </p><p>  On 12 July, my Department launched a public consultation to gather the views of stakeholders and interested parties in order to inform the development of a hydrogen strategy for Ireland. </p><p>  The consultation paper set out various areas of interest to be considered in the development of the hydrogen strategy and invited stakeholders&rsquo; responses on specific questions to be answered in this regard. Stakeholder views were sought on the broad landscape of potential hydrogen supply, infrastructure, storage, and demand in Ireland, as well as the potential export opportunities for hydrogen. Among the issues addressed was the question of storage and responses were invited on a range of questions as to how Ireland might best develop hydrogen storage capacity. </p><p>  The consultation ran for an 8-week response period, which concluded on Friday 2nd September, following which analysis of the responses received and preparation of the strategy document has begun, with a view to publication of the strategy before year-end.</p></reply>

These gas increases feed directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.Government is acutely aware of the impact on consumers of high electricity and gas prices, and has introduced a range of measures to mitigate their impact, including the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme with a payment of &euro;176.22 (excl. VAT) made to almost 2.2 million domestic electricity accounts between April and May of this year at a total cost of just under &euro;377 million. The Scheme was part of a package of measures, which included further increases in the Fuel Allowance, seeing it increase from &euro;735 in winter 2020/21 to &euro;1139 and a reduction in VAT on electricity bills from 13.5% to 9%.</p><p>Under Responses 6 and 7 of the National Energy Security Framework the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) announced enhanced consumer protection measures to be implemented by electricity and gas providers ahead of the coming winter. This means that from 1 December 2022 until 28 February 2023 no domestic customers can be disconnected while vulnerable customers cannot be disconnected from 1 October 2022 until 31 March 2022. These measures also include a requirement that customers with a financial hardship meter will be placed on the cheapest tariff available from their supplier from 1st December. This is in addition to the existing protections for vulnerable customers registered as being critically dependent on electrically powered assistive devices who cannot be disconnected for reasons of non-payment at any time. Full details of CRU&rsquo;s enhanced measures is available at: CRU202285-CRU-Decision-on-Additional-Customer-Protection-Measures-for-Household-Electricity-Gas-Custsomers_.pdf</p><p>On energy efficiency, the Government supports are considerable. Earlier this year the government announced a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills and lower emissions. &euro;118 million has been allocated to SEAI to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in, or at risk of, energy poverty. It is estimated that over 5,100 upgrades will be provided under SEAI Energy Poverty schemes in 2022. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further &euro;85 million as part of the Local Authority Retrofit Programme in 2022. This will deliver approximately 2,400 B2 retrofits of Local Authority homes this year. This means that of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million, &euro;203 million (58%) will be spent on dedicated energy poverty schemes and local authority retrofits.</p><p>Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity and gas markets is statutorily a matter for the CRU. It ceased price setting for electricity in 2011 and gas in 2014. Therefore, the setting of prices and charges is a commercial matter for individual supply companies. </p><p>Government has already put a &euro;2.4 billion package of measures in place to support people to meet the cost of energy and continues to monitor this unprecedented and evolving situation closely to inform ongoing consideration of further action, particularly in the context of the imminent Budget 2023. </p><p>The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy and expand interconnection with European and neighbouring markets and deepen internal market integration. </p></reply>

This included increases in grant rates from circa 30% to circa 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 standard and up to 80% of the typical cost for cavity and roof insulation. Data from the SEAI shows that since the launch of the new measures, demand across the retrofit schemes has been exceptionally high. As of the end of last month, over 30,000 applications for support had been received by SEAI. This is more than double the number received during the same period last year. This demand is translating into delivery with 13,400 home energy upgrades completed with support from across the range of schemes, up 70% when compared to the same period last year. Full details on the range of SEAI supports available can be found at www.seai.ie.    </p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the European Investment Bank in relation to the development of a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme. This will enable credit institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates to private homeowners and non-corporate landlords and make comprehensive home energy efficiency upgrades more affordable to consumers. It is intended that the loans under the guarantee available in the coming months.   </p>  <p>  Response 5 of the National Energy Security Framework introduced the nationwide Reduce Your Use campaign which is a programme of communications informing consumers and businesses what actions they can take to reduce their energy demand, how they could lower energy bills and what supports, including retrofit and insulation grants, are available to them. Further information can be found at www.gov.ie.   </p></reply>

Of the RESS-1 Community Projects, five were solar projects and two were wind, with four of the solar and both wind projects currently progressing through the scheme's delivery milestones to commercial operation this year or at the latest by the end of 2023. For the second RESS auction onwards, all community projects must be 100% community owned. Ten community projects were successful in the second RESS auction, eight of which are solar projects. These projects are expected to deliver by 2024 or at the latest, by the end of 2025.</p>  <p>  Alternatively, the Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) provides capital grants for both domestic and non-domestic applicants, such as public and community bodies, for solar PV installations up to 6.0kW, primarily for self-consumption, with grant levels up to a maximum of &euro;2,400 available. These solar PV grants are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and will become available to non-domestic applicants by the end of September. </p>  <p>  Suppliers are now obliged to offer a Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff to new and existing micro-and small-scale generators, so that they receive payment for excess renewable electricity that they export to the grid, reflective of the market value. More information is available at: Clean Export Tariff - Commission for Regulation of Utilities (cru.ie).</p>  <p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is due to consult on an implementation plan for the Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff by the end of 2022. This guaranteed export tariff support for new non-domestic installations greater than 6.0kW up to 50kW in size, is fixed for 15 years. For 2023 the rate will be 13.5c/kWh.  </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan commits to the development of a support scheme for small-scale generators (SSG) above 50kW to support the deployment of rooftop and ground-mounted solar PV. Supporting the development of public and community led projects will be a central focus of the scheme design. The scheme is expected to come into effect in 2023. A public consultation on proposed design elements of the SSG scheme is open until the 29th September.</p></reply>

All Departments were tasked with undertaking related analysis. For the purposes of efficiency, it was decided to pursue these actions together in a single review of climate action capacity in the civil service.

Section 16 of the Act requires each Local Authority to prepare a climate action plan, specifying the mitigation and adaptation measures to be adopted by the Local Authority. Local Authorities will have 12 months to complete their individual plans once requested by the Minister, with the request to be made within 18 months of the coming into operation of the Act.  Local Authority plans will have to be consistent with national climate plans and strategies, and will include both mitigation and adaptation measures to be updated every five years. Local Authorities will liaise with each other in the preparation of these plans and I have allocated &euro;3.5 million for Local Authorities to assist in this work this year.    </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Climate Action Regional Offices (CAROs), Local Authorities, and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to finalise a set of statutory guidelines detailing the approach Local Authorities are to take in the development and implementation of Local Authority climate action plans.   Decarbonisation zones are also being incorporated into the statutory guidelines for Local Authority plans. The guidelines will be issued to Local Authorities in the coming weeks.      </p>  <p>  While I have had no direct engagement with Galway City Council and Galway County Council with regard to supporting and promoting efforts at local government level on climate action, my Department continues to work with the four CAROs and stakeholders, including representatives from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, on a regular basis, in particular through participation in the National Local Authority Climate Action Steering Group which meets regularly. The CAROs continue to work with Local Authorities to both facilitate and monitor implementation of local climate actions undertaken under existing local adaptation strategies and the climate charter developed under the 2019 climate action plan.    </p>  <p>  My Department also continues to fund the implementation of the Local Authority Climate Action Training Programme.

This includes ensuring the Scheme prioritises those in the worst performing homes first and opening the Scheme for homeowner &lsquo;revisits&rsquo; thereby allowing them apply for deeper energy upgrade measures now available under the scheme. </p><p>- A special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation has also been introduced for all households. This will help to urgently reduce energy use as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to current exceptionally high energy prices.</p><p>Since then, demand across the SEAI retrofit schemes has been exceptionally high with a very significant increase in the number of applications, year to date when compared to the same period in 2021. This strong pipeline of projects is translating into delivery.</p><p>This year there is a target to complete almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including over 8,600 homes to a BER of B2. This compares to output of 15,500 upgrades last year. Figures provided by the SEAI show that to the end of August 13,406 homes have been completed across the residential energy efficiency schemes and of these, 4,234 have been upgraded to a post works Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 or better.</p><p>The number of free upgrades provided under the Warmer Homes Scheme each month has more than doubled versus last year. Of the overall home completions, above, 2,642 homes have been completed under the Warmer Homes Scheme, and of these 86 have been upgraded to a post works Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 or better.</p><p>Under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, 11 One Stop Shops have been registered with a 12<sup>th</sup>OSS expected shortly. SEAI continues to support a number of other organisations through the registration process.</p></reply>

Ministers agreed that immediate action must be taken to ensure the EU's security of supply and alleviate pressure on customers, while maintaining consistency with the current efforts to reduce gas demand and the objectives of the European Green Deal and REPowerEU.The Commission has proposed a number of short-term exceptional emergency measures in recent days which includes  capping the revenues of inframarginal electricity producers with low costs of production and introducing a solidarity contribution from fossil fuel companies to be used to mitigate the impact of high energy prices on customers. The cap proposed in the Commissions Regulation is based on a fixed figure of 180&euro; /MWh, rather than inframarginal rent being capped based on the price of coal or nuclear. The Commission&rsquo;s proposed legislation is already under urgent negotiation by Member States with the aim to have agreement by the end of the month. </p></reply>

The 2021 Act also provides for the introduction of sector-specific emission ceilings that must operate within the carbon budgets.     </p>  <p>  In July 2022, following an extensive process of engagement and analysis, the Government approved sectoral emission ceilings. These approved ceilings included unallocated savings in the second carbon budget period. This approach acknowledges that we are not yet in a position to identify all the emerging technologies, changing scientific consensus or policies to meet our full ambition and this consideration is provided for in Section 4(8)(h) of the 2021 Act.    </p>  <p>  As preparation of the ceilings was being finalised, important additional scientific information in relation to Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) emerged. As a result, the finalisation of this ceiling has been temporarily deferred. This deferral is provided for under the Act  as section 6C(4) notes that the Minister shall, &ldquo;as soon as may be after a carbon budget takes effect&rdquo; finalise and submit each sectoral emissions ceiling to the Government for approval. By taking this approach, the Government has acted positively to give certainty and direction to most sectors of the economy by providing sectoral emissions ceilings for those sectors as well as a clear target for emissions reduction. Further certainty will be provided following the settling of the emissions ceiling for the LULUCF sector as soon as may be, in parallel with the ongoing Land-use Strategy.    </p>  <p>  As a signatory to the Paris Agreement, Ireland is committed to holding global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The carbon budgets and sectoral ceilings place Ireland on a pathway to 51% emission reductions by 2030 and becoming net-zero by no later than 2050, thus contributing to the global effort to remain under the 1.5 degrees target.</p></reply>

At the Council of Energy Ministers meeting on 9 September, which I attended, the issue of windfall gains was discussed in some detail. Outline proposals were discussed and the Council of Energy Ministers invited the European Commission to make formal proposals. </p><p>On 14 September the European Commission published a proposed regulation which includes measures aimed at addressing windfall gains in the electricity sector and in fossil fuel production. These proposals are expected to raise additional revenues which will be used to reduce the cost of energy for households and businesses. It is important that this proposal captures the windfall gains and minimises negative impacts on consumers. </p><p>The proposal will be negotiated throughout the remainder of this month with a view to being approved at a meeting of the Council of Energy Ministers on 30 September. I fully support the objectives of this proposal and am working to ensure it fully addresses the issues of windfall gains in Ireland.</p></reply>

This commitment was made effective immediately upon the current Government taking office, and was placed on a statutory footing on commencement of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021.</p>  <p>  Holders of existing authorisations are not affected by these changes, and may apply to progress their authorisations through the licensing stages towards a natural conclusion &ndash; which may include expiry, relinquishment or production. This means that a future commercial discovery in an existing authorisation could potentially reach production. Any applications for follow-on authorisations or applications to conduct petroleum activities in the Irish offshore under an authorisation require Ministerial consent, and are required to meet environmental, technical and financial standards as appropriate. If no further gas and oil is discovered in line with the above process, it could be assumed, given the decline of Corrib, that indigenous gas production will be relatively small post 2030. </p>  <p>  This week, my Department launched a public consultation on the medium to long-term security of our electricity and gas systems. This review is considering the risks to both natural gas and electricity supplies and is examining a range of measures (including the need for additional capacity to import energy, energy storage, fuel diversification and renewable gases &ndash; such as hydrogen). The public consultation will help inform the review and the outcome of the review will be brought to Government for its consideration.</p></reply>

This in turn has led to increases in energy bills given the link between the wholesale price of gas and electricity. Government has already put a &euro;2.4 billion package of measures in place to support people and further measures are being considered for Budget 2023.   Government is acutely aware of the impact on consumers of high electricity and gas prices, and has introduced a range of measures to mitigate their impact including the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme, with a payment of &euro;176.22 made to almost 2.2 million domestic electricity accounts. The Scheme was part of a package of measures, which included further increases in the Fuel Allowance, seeing it increase from &euro;735 in 2020 to &euro;1,139 and a reduction in VAT on electricity bills from 13.5% to 9%.</p>  <p>  Under Responses 6 and 7 of the National Energy Security Framework the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) announced enhanced consumer protection measures to be implemented by electricity and gas providers ahead of the coming winter. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year the Government increased the grant rates significantly to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades. In particular, SEAI is being supported to focus on free energy upgrades for those at greatest risk of energy poverty. Business supports are also available to support businesses to improve energy efficiency. </p>  <p>  Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity and gas markets is statutorily a matter for CRU. It ceased price setting for electricity and gas in 2011 and 2014. The setting of prices is a commercial, competitive matter for individual supply companies.</p>  <p>  Any major interference in the energy market would need to be carefully considered to avoid potentially disrupting a market that is already facing significant challenges and exposing the Exchequer, and ultimately the taxpayer, to potentially unquantifiable costs. In this regard, direct assistance to consumers, like the Domestic Electricity Payment, and targeted measures like the Fuel Allowance, are a better approach.</p>  <p>  I am also working with colleagues across Government to understand the impact of energy prices on businesses and to support the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment in tailoring responses. </p>  <p>  Following an Emergency Energy Council Meeting on the 9th of September the EU Commission is proposing potential additional measures which include capping the revenues of inframarginal electricity produces. These are very important developments, and I will be working very closely with my EU counterparts over the coming weeks on these proposals.</p></reply>

RESS 1 is expected to deliver 1,022MW of new renewable generation, 569MW of solar and 453MW of wind, an approximate 15% increase in Ireland&rsquo;s current renewable energy generation capacity by the end of 2023. </p>  <p>  To date, 11 projects equalling 353MW of new renewable generation have already connected to the grid under RESS 1, pushing grid connected renewables above 5GW. Between RESS 1 and Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs), it is anticipated that over 700 MW of new renewables will be connected to the grid in 2022, with over 300MW of connections expected next year under RESS 1.</p>  <p>  The most recent RESS 2 auction is expected to deliver an additional increase of nearly 20% to Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy generation. 80 projects were initially successful in RESS 2 and are expected to lead to 300 MW of wind and almost 1,500 MW of solar in 2024/25, with additional CPPAs likely to support the development of further wind and solar generation.</p>  <p>  In terms of offshore, good progress has been made over the past year which demonstrate our commitment to delivering on our offshore renewable energy ambition including: </p>  <p>  The development of the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) provides for long-term forward planning for Ireland's maritime area and will enhance the effective management of marine activities and more sustainable use of our marine resources. The enactment of the Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021 has delivered a new legislative basis for the regulation of Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area usage outside the 12 nautical mile coastal zone.</p>  <p>  The Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA), to manage consenting, licensing and enforcement activities in our marine space is expected to be established and operational from early 2023.</p>  <p>  Maritime Area Consent (MAC) applications opened in April for the first batch of offshore energy projects. This is the first stage in the new regulatory regime and involves a robust assessment of applicants to ensure that only the most viable developers gain entry to the planning system. My Department is currently assessing applications from a number of projects (Phase 1), and decisions on the first MACs are expected in the second half of this year. These projects will be eligible to compete in the first Offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (ORESS 1).</p>  <p>  The CRU, assisted by EirGrid and my Department has a programme of actions underway to ensure the security of our electricity supply over the coming winters. The Security of Supply Programme of actions contains a number of both demand and supply side mitigation measures to address the forecasted shortfall, including temporary generation capacity.</p></reply>

Construction is underway across 26 counties demonstrating that the project is reaching scale. To date, the level of connections is increasing on a daily basis and is in line with or exceeding projections. NBI has advised that over 15,000 premises in County Cork are passed with a high-speed fibre broadband network and available for immediate connection.  </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie , which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  </p>  <p>  NBI has made recent improvements to their website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) in all 26 counties. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed and connected to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: www.nbi.ie </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 9 September, 716 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cork 94 BCPs are installed to date. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/broadband-connection-points/ </p>  <p>  In County Cork 70 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area.

However, no AD projects have come through the RESS auctions to date. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan also commits to the development of a support scheme for small-scale generators (SSG) above 50kW, i.e. larger than MSS  but smaller than RESS scale. This is expected to come into effect in 2023. My Department launched a public consultation on proposed elements of the SSG scheme which is open until the 29th September: www.gov.ie/en/consultation/353f2-consultation-on-a-small-scale-generation-support-scheme-ssg-in-ireland/    </p>  <p>  Ireland currently has 6.3% of its heat sector demand met by renewable energy. While progress is being made, significant action is needed to reduce emissions and increase the supply of renewable fuels across the heat sector. Anaerobic digestion for renewable heat is supported through the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH). The SSRH provides an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems and an installation grant for renewable heating systems using heat pumps.</p>  <p>  In line with the recent agreement on Sectoral Emissions Ceilings to deliver up to 5.7 TWh of biomethane to further accelerate the reduction of overall economy-wide emissions, an obligation on the heat sector to include renewable heat will be introduced by 2024. The introduction of this Obligation will incentivise the use of renewable heat, while spreading the obligation across all non-renewable fuel types. </p>  <p>  The Renewable Fuel for Transport policy was published by the Minister for Transport in November 2021. Under the policy, a category for certain renewable fuels called &lsquo;Development Renewable Fuels&rsquo; will, subject to enabling legislation, be eligible to receive multiple credits under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation Scheme to incentivise their deployment. Biomethane is included within this category and will be eligible for  1.5x credit for its deployment as a transport energy from 1st January 2023. Further, advanced biofuels and biogas produced from feedstock listed at Annex IX of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (REDII) will be awarded double credit.</p></reply>

This includes: </p><p>- A new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme providing increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard.</p><p>- Establishment of a network of registered One Stop Shops to offer a start-to-finish project management service, including access to financing, for home energy upgrades. 11 OSSs have been registered to date with a 12<sup>th</sup>OSS expected shortly.</p><p>- A significant increase in the number of free energy upgrades provided to those at risk of energy poverty alongside changes to the operation of the Warmer Homes Scheme. This includes ensuring the Scheme prioritises those in the worst performing homes first and opening the Scheme for homeowner &lsquo;revisits&rsquo; thereby allowing them apply for deeper energy upgrade measures now available under the scheme. </p><p>- A special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation has also been introduced for all households. This will help to urgently reduce energy use as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to current exceptionally high energy prices.</p><p>Since then, demand across the SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes has been exceptionally high with a very significant increase in the number of applications year to date when compared to the same period in 2021. This strong pipeline of projects is translating into delivery.</p><p>This year there is a target to complete almost 27,000 home energy upgrades, including over 8,600 homes to a BER of B2. This compares to 15,500 upgrades delivered last year.  Figures provided by the SEAI show that to the end of August 13,406 homes have been completed across the residential energy efficiency schemes, equating to a 70% increase on the same period last year, and of these, 4,234 have been upgraded to a post works Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2 or better, a 140 increase n the same period last year.</p><p>To the end of August, 2,769 homes have been upgraded under SEAI energy poverty schemes, this is almost three times the number of homes upgraded in the same period last year.  </p><p>SEAI also offer a suite of supports specifically for the business sector. The available supports include:</p><p>- The Excellence in Energy Efficiency Design (EXEED) scheme is for organisations, both public and private planning a major investment in energy efficiency. </p><p>- The Support Scheme Renewable Heat (SSRH) supports adoption of renewable heat by commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating and public sector organisations not covered by the emissions trading system. </p><p>- The Support Scheme for Energy Audits (SSEA) offers &euro;2,000 towards the cost of a professional high quality energy audit.</p><p>- The Large Industry Energy Network (LIEN) is a network of large organisations who, with the support of the SEAI, work together to improve their energy performance.</p><p>The Government is acutely aware of the impact of rising energy prices on businesses and households. While a &euro;2.4 billion package of policies and measures have already been put in place to support energy consumers, the Government recognises that more needs to be done as prices continue to increase. For that reason, additional measures to support businesses and households are being examined in the context of the forthcoming Budget.</p></reply>

Ministers agreed that immediate action must be taken to ensure the EU's security of supply and alleviate pressure on customers, while maintaining consistency with the current efforts to reduce gas demand and the objectives of the European Green Deal and REPowerEU.The Commission has proposed a number of short-term exceptional emergency measures in recent days which includes  capping the revenues of inframarginal electricity producers with low costs of production, with the income from the measures to be used to mitigate the impact of high energy prices on customers.     </p>  <p>  The approach proposed by the European Commission is favourable to the alternative concept of decoupling gas from the electricity market. The decoupling alternative would directly interfere with the market dispatch of generation units with a potentially significant impact on cross border trade  of electricity. It is important that in making urgently needed changes to the electricity market, that there is no unintended consequences arising, in particular, damaging the trade of electricity. In Ireland's case this is crucial in the context of the all-Island Single Electricity Market and for imports and exports to Great Britain. </p></reply>

We are looking at a mix of broad based measures which will help all business and at targeted interventions for those most impacted. This approach has been central to our budget discussions and new measures will be announced on Budget Day, Tuesday 27th September.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 will be about putting money back in people&rsquo;s pockets and that will include further measures to help households and businesses with their energy costs. The Government will keep the energy situation under close and active review, and we will continue to examine what measures are possible to manage the impact of rising energy prices for households and businesses.</p>  <p>  What makes this situation challenging to respond to is the fact that it is being driven by international factors &ndash; outside of Ireland&rsquo;s control. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working with the European Commission to allow us to grant state aid to certain businesses to help them with additional costs (both liquidity and energy costs) due to the Russian war on Ukraine. This is under the Ukraine Temporary Crisis Framework introduced by the European Commission. While some of these interventions will be targeted at those firms that trade internationally or are impacted by global trade, a more broad based loan scheme will also be open to most business.</p>  <p>  We will also be looking to raise awareness around energy efficiency, helping businesses reduce the amount of energy they use in the first place and improving take-up of the approximately 20 different schemes we already have in place for business.</p>  <p>  For example, in June we announced a new &euro;55 million &lsquo;Green Transition&rsquo; fund to help businesses move away from fossil fuels and towards more sustainable, cheaper alternatives. This includes the Enterprise Emissions Reduction Investment Fund, which provides Enterprise Ireland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and IDA Ireland manufacturing clients grants of up to &euro;1m to improve their energy efficiency and decarbonise their processes.</p>  <p>  The Government has not been found wanting when it has come to helping businesses get through difficult periods, including those in the manufacturing sector. The multi-billion euro financial assistance provided by Government during the pandemic was unprecedented, whether it was help with businesses&rsquo; wage bill so they could keep staff on, their overheads, the introduction of a cheaper, easier way to restructure and survive than examinership; the commercial rates waiver, or the reduction in VAT for the hospitality sector.</p></reply>

Officials in the Department are currently looking at a range of specialised private firms that specialise in collecting and collating such data.

The purpose of this has been to identify transactions that might potentially represent a risk to security and public order, rather than an attempt to predict the number of transactions that might be subject to screening. I am happy to say that so far, we have not identified any completed third country transactions in Ireland that we believe might represent a significant risk to security or public order.</p>  <p>  In preparation for implementing a screening regime, officials from my Department have undertaken significant work to estimate the number of transactions that might require notification and screening, based on the mandatory regime proposed in the Screening of Third Country Transactions Bill 2022. </p>  <p>  Based on this work, it is anticipated that only a small number of investments, mergers or transactions might pose a risk to our security and public order. Accordingly, to maintain our attractiveness to investors, our investment screening mechanism must be proportionate and tailored to these risks, without undermining Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness to inward FDI more generally.  </p>  <p>  Based on the limited data available, there are relatively few transactions that would meet both the criteria requiring screening whilst also representing a potential threat to security and public order. Officials estimate that fewer than 100 third country transactions per year will require notification.</p>  <p>  Looking at 2021 data from William Fry, there were approximately 172 inbound M&amp;A deals, worth over &euro;19 billion. These 172 deals include Irish and intra-EU deals. Excluding these intra-EU transactions, there remain approximately 118 transactions which potentially might have been screened.</p>  <p>  Of course, some of these investments relate to non-sensitive sectors and would not raise any concerns. Therefore, excluding such non-sensitive transactions - relating for example to transactions in the leisure sector - brings the total number of third country transactions in potentially relevant sectors and activities to below 100 per annum.</p>  <p>  Of these, third-country, non-EU transactions, approximately one third tend to be accounted for by US investments, and another third are accounted for by UK investments.</p>  <p>  Another potential guide to screening activity is the work of The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). The CCPC received 41 merger notifications in 2020, and 81 in 2021. It is important to note, however, that the CCPC are looking at mergers from a competition perspective, whereas the investment screening provisions relate to security and public order.</p>  <p>  Officials continue to consult with colleagues across the EU on this matter, and so far, based on these discussions, the expected quantum of notifications appears robust.</p></reply>

The last REFIT schemes closed in December 2015. In 2020, REFIT was replaced by the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The REFIT contracts do not have a requirement to make payments to the PSO when the wholesale electricity price is higher than the REFIT reference price. 1,088MW of renewable energy was contracted under the first RESS auction (RESS-1), of which 1,022MW remains in the scheme. This total includes both projects still progressing towards commencing generation in 2022 or at the latest by the end of 2023, and those that have commenced generation already. </p><p>  The most recent RESS 2 auction is expected to deliver an additional increase of nearly 20% to Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy generation. 80 projects were initially successful in RESS 2 and are expected to lead to 300 MW of wind and almost 1,500 MW of solar in 2024/25</p><p>  RESS projects are required, as part of the RESS contract, to make payments to the PSO when the wholesale electricity price is greater than their RESS strike price. 629 MW of  RESS capacity is due to make payments to consumers under the PSO for 2022/23 amounting to &euro;313 million.Last Wednesday the European Commission published a proposal for a Council Regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. This proposal will assist Government in determining whether and, if so, how a windfall tax and other interventions could be introduced. Such an intervention will address the situation where energy companies, including projects on REFIT contracts, are receiving windfall gains due to increased wholesale gas prices. Officials from my Department continue to work with colleagues across Government on this issue.  </p></reply>

As part of the achievement of this reduction, the CAP set ambitious targets to install 600,000 heat pumps in homes by 2030, of which 400,000 will be in existing homes.    The Government recently announced a package of supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades. The new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offers increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with heat pump. Homes that take a step-by-step approach can avail of grants of up to &euro;6,500 for the replacement of fossil fuelled boilers with heat pumps. Full details on the range of SEAI supports available can be found at www.seai.ie.</p>  <p>  The National Energy Security Framework (NESF), outlines that a National Policy Statement on Heat will be developed this year, based on the outcomes of the National Heat Study, including a key focus on the decarbonisation of our building stock and the development of district heating. The National Heat Study highlights that the Government must decide when the appropriate time to phase out new fossil fuel boilers in homes is. The NESF under Response 17, sets out a commitment to develop proposals for regulatory and policy options to accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel heating throughout our building stock. This will allow all sectors of the economy adequate time to plan this phase-out, and to give the heat pump industry retrofit sector adequate time to scale up capacity. This work is underway and is being led by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The Government has no plans to ban replacement boilers in the short term and is aware that this will need to be done in a manner that protects the most vulnerable in society. Fossil fuel heating is the most expensive form of heating which has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. CAP21 has signalled that the Government will publish a high level phase-out plan in the next Climate Action Plan. A consultation is currently open on the plan and a further public consultation will be completed on any specific heat policy.</p></reply>

A Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established in mid-2017, and continued to operate until December 2020, to monitor the on-going cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the &lsquo;flat-rate structure&rsquo; was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings were observed during the period in which the PMG operated, the overall trend was relative price stability. Results from the PMG are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, I launched a new national waste policy for the period 2020-2025, A Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy. This plan contains a range of measures to empower households through enhanced consumer protection requirements including an enhanced monitoring of the market to ensure continued relative price stability.</p></reply>

It is assisted in its role by EirGrid. The CRU, supported by Eirgrid and my Department, currently has a programme of actions underway to ensure the security of our electricity supply over the coming winters. </p><p>The people in the situations referred to by the Deputies would appear eligible to be registered as vulnerable customers. A vulnerable customer is defined as a household customer who is critically dependent on electrically powered equipment, which includes, but is not limited to, life protecting devices, assistive technologies to support independent living and medical equipment or who is particularly vulnerable to disconnection during the winter months for reasons of advanced age or physical, sensory, intellectual or mental health. It is important that people who are in such a situation contact their energy supplier to register with them as a vulnerable customer. Their electricity supplier will then notify ESB Networks. ESBN maintains a Vulnerable Customer Register based on the information provided to them by suppliers. </p><p>Furthermore, the CRU has in place a range of protections against disconnection that are set out in the Supplier Handbook. Vulnerable customers registered as being critically dependent on electrically powered assistive devices cannot be disconnected for reasons of non-payment at any time.</p></reply>

An integrated, structured, and evidence-based approach to identify and plan our response to just climate transition requirements.</p>  <p>  2. People are equipped with the right skills to be able to participate in and benefit from the future net zero economy.</p>  <p>  3. The costs are shared so that the impact is equitable and existing inequalities are not exacerbated.</p>  <p>  4. Social dialogue to ensure impacted citizens and communities are empowered and are core to the transition process.</p>  <p>  As set out in CAP 2021, all relevant Ministers should consider this framework in the process of climate action policy formulation and implementation, so that policies are informed by the need to ensure a just transition. This includes creating sustainable employment opportunities, providing reskilling and retraining opportunities, and providing appropriate supports for those most vulnerable as part of Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a climate neutral economy. </p>  <p>  The Government has also committed, through CAP 2021, to establishing a statutory Just Transition Commission, with the general scheme of legislation to establish the Commission to be agreed by the end of this year. CAP 2021 sets out that the purpose of the Commission will be to provide strategic advice to Government, integrating its role with existing governance and engagement structures, on how Government policy can further a just transition. I am continuing to progress the development of proposals in relation to the establishment of the Commission, with a view to the timelines set out in CAP 2021. This work has included engagement with relevant stakeholders to inform my approach to the mandate of the Commission, including through the National Climate Stakeholder Forum, the most recent meeting of which took place on 27 July last.  </p></reply>

A public consultation on the draft terms and conditions for ORESS 1 was held between October 2021 and December 2021 and over 150 responses were received. My Department issued a formal response to consultation feedback on 31 May 2022. As per Question No. 72 of 1 June 2022 and the Provisional ORESS 1 Auction Timetable, published by EirGrid on 21 June 2022, the ORESS 1 auction is scheduled to launch in Q4 2022, subject to the availability of a sufficient quantity of eligible projects for a competitive auction. Key auction eligibility criteria will be for offshore wind projects to hold both a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) and a Grid Connection Assessment (GCA). MACs were established under the Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021 and are planned to be issued by me, as Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, to the first batch of offshore wind projects before the end of this year. GCAs are planned to issue to this batch of projects, from EirGrid, in a similar timeframe and in advance of the qualification stage of the ORESS 1 process in Q1 2023. While the MAC and GCA processes remain underway, the ORESS Project Board decided to continue to develop the ORESS 1 terms and conditions further over summer 2022, including consideration of several measures with the intention of further de-risking the auction process and to ultimately reduce the cost borne by electricity consumers. Final ORESS 1 Terms and Conditions are scheduled to be submitted for Government approval and publication in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

At the Council meeting, Ministers agreed that immediate action must be taken to ensure the EU's security of supply and alleviate pressure on customers, while maintaining consistency with the current efforts to reduce gas demand and the objectives of the European Green Deal and REPowerEU. As a result, the Commission has since proposed a number of short-term exceptional emergency measures, which include a proposal to cap the revenues of inframarginal electricity producers with low costs of production.</p>  <p>  The Commission proposed such legislation on 14 September. This is already under urgent negotiation by Member States in order to have agreement by the end of the month. My Department is not yet able to have an accurate estimate of the likely revenue that arise from this proposal as Ireland, along with other Member States, is seeking clarification from the Commission on the proposal. The proposal may be amended before being presented to the Council later this month. It is important to note that the actual revenue will depend on many variables including in particular, the prevailing price of natural gas. </p></reply>

However, I am acutely aware of the impact that current, internationally influenced, energy price increases are having on people and families and, for that reason, Government has put in place a series of measures with funding of &euro;2.4 billion available to help alleviate the impact, particularly on lower income households. Further measures are being considered in the context of Budget 2023.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in the Climate Action Plan 2021, a District Heating Steering Group was established earlier this year. The Steering Group has met eight times to date and oversees a number of Working Groups that are conducting in-depth, solutions-based analysis of the key areas that must be addressed in order to support district heating. The Steering Group is working on recommendations to ensure that a robust governance and regulatory framework is put in place to support the expansion of district heating. This will help ensure consumer protection, and considerations in this regard encompass legacy group heating schemes that are already in operation. </p>  <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will soon initiate a pilot feasibility study to explore the technical viability and implications of moving existing group heating schemes to renewable energy sources.

This is how microgeneration can help consumers shield against electricity costs. While there is potential for payment for any excess electricity that you might not use yourself, export is an additional benefit but not the primary driver for engaging in microgeneration.</p><p>The phased introduction of the Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) has begun with the commencement of the MSS domestic solar PV grant on 16 February last, with grant levels up to a maximum of &euro;2,400 available through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  </p><p>  The SEAI has also supported the installation of domestic Solar PV systems for over 12,000 homes since 2018, and with demand for the domestic Solar PV grant increasing significantly throughout the year, we expect that the SEAI will support over 8,000 homes in 2022 alone. The SEAI will be extending the Solar PV grant scheme to non-domestic applicants for installations up to 6kW by the end of September.  </p><p>  On 15 February this year I signed the Regulations that create an obligation on all suppliers to offer the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff to new and existing micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment for excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflective of the market value. This provides microgenerators with an additional incentive for their investment in renewable technology. </p><p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG which outlines the arrangements for its implementation, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. As part of this, the CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. Payments will be backdated to the date of eligibility or the 15th February 2022 (the date the regulations were enacted), whichever is the latest.  </p><p>  The CRU has asked suppliers to communicate their decision to their customers on when initial CEG payments will be made at the earliest opportunity. Most suppliers have now advertised their CEG tariff rates, which range from &euro;13.5c/kWh up to &euro;20c/kWh. This allows customers to shop around and switch suppliers to obtain the best rates for selling and purchasing electricity. The CRU advises customers to contact their supplier to obtain information on their suppliers' CEG tariff arrangements.  </p><p>  I understand that over 30,000 micro- and small-scale generators have successfully registered for export and 22,500 of this cohort have smart meters which means they are already accruing the value of the CEG tariff for their exported electricity.  </p><p>New installations greater than 6kW up to 50kW will be eligible for a Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff per kWh exported. The CEP will be &euro;0.135/kWh in 2022 and 2023, fixed for 15 years. It is expected that the CEP will be implemented further to a public consultation process to be undertaken by the CRU by the end of this year. </p></reply>

These gas increases feed directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.</p><p>Government is acutely aware of the impact on consumers of high electricity and gas prices, and introduced a &euro;2.4 billion package of measures to mitigate their impact including the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Scheme, under which a payment of &euro;176.22 to over 2 million domestic electricity accounts. The Scheme was part of a package of measures, which included further increases in the Fuel Allowance, seeing it increase from &euro;735 in 2020 to &euro;1,139 and a reduction in VAT on electricity bills from 13.5% to 9%.</p><p>Further measures are actively being considered in the context of Budget 2023.</p><p>The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has also announced enhanced consumer protection measures to be implemented by electricity and gas providers ahead of the coming winter. This will provide additional protections from disconnections and other safeguards for customers.</p><p>Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity and gas markets was assigned to the CRU under the 1999 Electricity Regulation Act and subsequent legislation. CRU ceased price setting for electricity and gas in 2011 and 2014. Therefore, the setting of prices and charges is a commercial matter for individual supply companies. </p><p>The best long term solution to energy poverty is make homes energy efficient and thus warmer and healthier to live in. Earlier this year the Government increased the rates of grants operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) significantly to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades. In particular, SEAI is being supported to focus on free energy upgrades for those at greatest risk of energy poverty. These schemes are seeing significant demand increases. Business supports are also available to support businesses to improve energy efficiency.</p><p>Our long term priority and the best long-term approach for Ireland is to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy and expand interconnection with European and neighbouring markets and deepen internal market integration.</p></reply>

The 2015 National Cyber Security Strategy formally established the functions of the NCSC as being &ldquo;&hellip; to lead in the management of major cyber security incidents, provide guidance and advice to citizens and businesses, and manage cyber security related risks to key services&rdquo;.The mandate of the NCSC broadly covers the following three missions: </p>  <p>  - Incident response, including coordinating the national response to a major cyber security incident; </p>  <p>  - Resilience, i.e. working with public bodies and critical infrastructure to prevent and mitigate cyber security incidents;</p>  <p>  - Information sharing and support.</p>  <p>  The NCSC works closely with the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and with counterparts in the UK, US, the EU and its Member States, as well as partners other like-minded States, to share information on incidents, risks and threats. The NCSC has been operating at an enhanced state of readiness in response to the deterioration in the global cyber threat environment associated with Russia's latest invasion of Ukraine in February of this year. </p>  <p>  The NCSC continues to monitor the threat of cyber security incidents affecting Irish public services and critical infrastructure including spillover impacts from incidents occurring outside the State. The NCSC considers that the threat to Ireland is moderate and is engaging on an ongoing basis with constituents including Government Departments and state agencies, operators of essential services, critical infrastructure operators and other important entities. It is worth highlighting that in addition to the threat of cyber security incidents associated with the war in Ukraine, there remains a very considerable threat from international cyber criminal gangs of financial fraud, theft of sensitive or personal data, or ransomware. Recognising that the risk of debilitating cyber security incident has increased, the NCSC has in recent months introduced a number of new supportive measures for its constituents. This is in addition to the frequent information sharing that occurs on both a general and sectoral basis with NCSC constituents. In addition to publishing a detailed threat assessment, the NCSC has published a Cyber Vitals checklist to assist entities in assessing their cyber security maturity and address any areas of concern. </p>  <p>The NCSC has also published guidance on Securing Operational Technology, and these and other guidance documents are available on the NCSC website. The NCSC has recently established a CORE network bringing together IT security managers from across the public sector to facilitate sharing of information and good practices. Building on the Baseline Cyber Security Standard for Public Bodies published last year the NCSC is currently working with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer to develop cyber security procurement guidelines to support public bodies.</p></reply>

Both the UK and Ireland both have far less reliance on Russian gas than other European Countries. The UK&rsquo;s gas supply comes from indigenous supplies, via pipelines from Norway, interconnectors with Belgium and the Netherlands and through imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). </p><p>As production from the Corrib gas field declines, our import dependence on natural gas from the UK will increase in the near term. </p><p>In light of the Ukraine crisis, the European Commission is working closely with Member States to protect the resilience of Europe&rsquo;s gas supply. The Commission is also actively engaging with other countries to ensure sufficient and timely supply of natural gas to the EU from diverse sources across the globe to avoid supply shocks, including those that could result from disruptions.  </p><p>It is essential that we cut our dependence on imported fossil fuels, and power comes from our own indigenous renewable resources including wind and solar.

This engagement was informed and supported by the procurement of external technical support services, as well as modelling support from members of the Climate Action Modelling Group (CAMG).   </p>  <p>  Through an iterative process that comprised extensive and frequent engagement with the relevant Departments and Agencies, as well as with members of the CAMG, policies and measures (including those identified in Climate Action Plan 2021) were assessed and refined to determine their emission abatement potential, while also considering various other factors and constraints such as cost, feasibility, and socioeconomic impact. The potential measures, actions and ceilings were also assessed in terms of alignment with other sustainability goals, and effectiveness in reaching &lsquo;net zero&rsquo; no later than 2050. A significant number of workshops, bilateral meetings, and inter-departmental meetings were held to refine the analysis, and to understand the associated delivery challenges.    </p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising a document, to be made publicly available shortly, which provides a summary of the analysis undertaken to inform and support this process. This document will include appendices that contain a comprehensive overview of the analysis used in the preparation of the ceilings, as well as a bibliography of all reports, studies and other documentation that were referenced during this process.</p></reply>

The EPA&rsquo;s report is a strong reminder of the challenges Ireland faces as we seek to meet our ambitious, yet necessary, climate objectives and emission targets.    </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding an anticipated increase in emissions in 2021 as the country emerged from the most severe Covid-19 restrictions, we must consider how to accelerate the measures and actions that will not only reduce our emissions, but will also support new ways of conducting business and encouraging innovation. To reverse the current trajectory of emissions and meet our 2030 and 2050 targets, a significant shift is required in the speed at which we roll-out and ramp-up up the policies, measures and actions that will decarbonise our economy and improve our indigenous supply of sustainable and renewable energy. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, significantly strengthens the legally binding framework for climate governance in Ireland, and the recently approved sectoral emission ceilings set out a clear pathway for meeting our carbon budgets and Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030. These ceilings will be reflected in the next Climate Action Plan, which is due to be published by the end of 2022.    </p>  <p>  This Climate Action Plan will build on the 2021 Plan and set out the policies, measures and actions to keep us within our carbon budgets and on the pathway to a zero-emissions economy by no later than 2050. The process to deliver this new Climate Action Plan will include my Department engaging with other Government Departments, State Agencies and civil society to identify opportunities for accelerating climate action. </p></reply>

The award comprises 470 MHz of spectrum and represents a 46% increase in the harmonised spectrum assigned for the provision of wireless broadband services in Ireland. This will enable the operators to provide improved services to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data and new services. The proposals include significant coverage obligations for prospective winning bidders.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce has been a driving force since 2016 for improving access to telecommunications services nationwide with over 70 targeted actions completed to alleviate connectivity barriers.

However, my Department has provided funding for a significant upgrade and expansion of the network in recent years, such that the number of monitoring stations has increased from 29 in 2017 to 103 today. This is the final year of the expansion of the network and 116 will be in operation by December. All stations collect air quality data for a range of pollutants in order to provide information to the public, and for assessment against European legal limit values. Details of the locations of all monitoring stations currently in operation, along with real-time and historic data from each station, can be found at: www.airquality.ie</p>  <p>  The EPA produce an annual report on Air Quality in Ireland which provides an overview of our air quality and key issues that impact on it. The annual report for 2021 has just been published and can be accessed through the EPA website: www.epa.ie.</p>  <p>  The LIFE EMERALD project, which commenced in 2021, will use the information from our monitoring network to provide a national 3-day air quality forecast and near real-time mapping of air pollutants throughout the country; as well as to create historical maps of air pollutants. The project will improve Ireland&rsquo;s ambient air quality management capabilities, by using an air quality modelling system to gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to poor air quality and develop a system that will provide better information to the public. In addition, the Clean Air Strategy will be published later this year and will provide the framework necessary to ensure continued improvements in the quality of our air.</p></reply>

Following the process set out in the Act, a carbon budget programme proposed by the Climate Change Advisory Council was adopted by the Oireachtas on 6 April 2022. On 28 July, the Government approved Sectoral Emission Ceilings for both the first and second carbon budget periods, (i.e. 2021-2025 and 2026-2030), with the exception the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, which will be determined later.</p>  <p>  There is target for a 25% emissions reduction for our agriculture sector by 2030. The Climate Action Plan 2021 has outlined how emission reductions can be achieved in this sector in the coming years, which involves offering farmers the means to reduce carbon emissions at farm level by becoming more carbon efficient, while also diversifying toward the production of energy and less carbon intensive practices such as organic farming. These measures, and the extent to which progress is being made, will be reflected in the next Climate Action Plan, which is due to be published by the end of 2022.In the meantime, my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine continue to collaborate on reducing our carbon emissions, while also ensuring the security and sustainability of our food production. This is a key opportunity for Ireland to become a world leader in long-term sustainable food production. I remain confident that our family farms will fully exploit the opportunities of this transition without compromising on sustainable food production. To address emissions in manufacturing the Department has engaged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the sectoral emissions ceiling for industry. This included further reviews of measures set by Climate Action Plan 2021 to ensure that they can deliver the emissions reductions required by the sectoral emissions ceilings and meet other requirements such as technical feasibility and cost effectiveness in terms of their wider economic impacts. We are also working with our State Agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices to provide advisory and financial supports for low-carbon technologies.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. The transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall carbon emissions, must play a central role in the national decarbonisation effort. The national car and van (LGV) fleet accounts for almost 60% of all land transport emissions, and so a transition to low emissions vehicles, including EVs, is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions.  </p>  <p>  Electric vehicles are an important transport mitigation measure in the 2021 Climate Action Plan, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.</p>  <p>  There are 11 commercial and 8 non-commercial agencies under the remit of my Department. Where the CEO of an agency under the remit of the Department has provision in their contract for the use of a car, the Minister stipulates the company vehicle should be an electric vehicle</p>  <p>  I have forwarded the Deputies question to each agency for direct response.  Please contact my Office if no reply is received within 10 working days. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan and the Programme for Government commits to developing and implementing a sustainable public procurement policy, to ensure that what are we buying and building is consistent with our climate ambition. </p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement has drawn up fixed price procurement frameworks for the supply of long and medium range battery electric passenger cars and vans to public sector bodies. Full details on how to use the framework as well as pricing and supplier contact details can be found on the www.ogp.gov.ie website.  These Frameworks will greatly assist Government departments and bodies to purchase electric cars and vans.  As battery and recharging technologies develop and a greater range of vehicles become commercially available I expect an increasing number of public bodies to transition to EVs. </p>  <p>  The use of EVs within public sector vehicle fleets and the installation of associated EV infrastructure is an important exemplar and market driver, providing the necessary public leadership and raising consumer awareness of EVs.</p></reply>

The Courts Service have started to use the new electronic interface since early September 2022, and this has replaced the manual process.   </p>  <p>  The new solution will enhance road safety by ensuring that the NVDF reflects the correct driver disqualification status earlier. The sharing of the information electronically will reduce the time taken to update the NVDF with details of driver disqualifications, improve data accuracy because of the reduction in errors due to manual updating of disqualification notifications and driver records; and reduce operational costs for the RSA and the Court Services. It will also enable such information to be shared with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na more quickly.  </p>  <p>  Enforcement is a critical tool that acts to modify driver behaviour to reduce risk taking and I commend the collaborative working of the Courts Service, the Road Safety Authority and my own officials in successfully delivering this important project. </p></reply>

It is aimed at improving air quality in urban areas, reducing the CO2 emissions of a sector which typically has very high mileage, and also can positively influence the uptake of zero emission passenger cars by improving general perception and awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use. The Scheme is funded by the Department of Transport and administered by NTA acting as agents of the Department with delegated authority and as the licensing authority for SPSVs. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to enable owners of small public service vehicles, such as taxis, hackneys and limousines, to buy electric vehicles.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is available nationwide to persons applying for new SPSV licenses and existing SPSV license holders who wish to upgrade their current vehicle with a replacement EV. </p>  <p>  The scheme is currently open for applications.</p></reply>

For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, the rate was 0.60% of the pension scheme assets. For the year 2014, the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative.</p><p>The Universal Social Charge (USC) came into effect on the 1st January 2011 to replace the Income Levy and Health Levy, neither of which gave relief for pension contributions. It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.</p><p>The USC is an annual tax payable on an individual&rsquo;s total income in a year, subject to a number of exemptions and reliefs.  In particular, an individual is not liable to pay USC where his or her total income in the tax year does not exceed &euro;13,000 and individuals aged 70 and over benefit from a lower rate of USC (provided their total income does not exceed &euro;60,000).</p><p>Pensions, other than pensions paid by the Department of Social Protection, form part of an individual&rsquo;s income for USC purposes in years in which they are paid and are charged to USC.</p><p>PRSI is not payable on an individual&rsquo;s income once they have reached the age of 66.</p><p>An individual may be eligible for the yearly Age Tax Credit if they are 65 years or older in the tax year, or jointly assessed or separately assessed with a partner who is 65 years or older in the tax year. </p><p>The Age Tax Credit is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Status</th>       <th>Amount of Credit</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Single, widowed, surviving civil partner or singly assessed</td>       <td>&euro;245</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jointly or separately assessed</td>       <td>&euro;490</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition an individual may not have to pay Income Tax if they or their spouse or civil partner are aged 65 or over, where their total income is less than, or equal to, the exemption limits.</p><p>The exemption limits are as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Personal circumstances</th>       <th>Exemption limit</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Single, widowed or a surviving civil partner</td>       <td>&euro;18,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Married or in a civil partnership</td>       <td>&euro;36,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>For dependent children, the exemption limits are increased by &euro;575 per child for the first two children and &euro;830 per child for each additional child.</p></reply>

Revenue operates a long-standing administrative practice which allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 to employees, for each day worked from home, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI or USC. There is no legal obligation on an employer to make such a payment, as it is at the discretion of the employer.</p>  <p>  The home-working allowance originated in 1993; according to the CSO's CPI Inflation Calculator, the inflation rate in Ireland since January 1993 is 81 per cent which, if applied to the &euro;3.20 rate, would amount to &euro;5.79 today.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department reviewed the tax arrangements for remote working as part of the 2021 Tax Strategy Group process and published the resultant paper on the Department's website. The review found that the daily tax-free rate of &euro;3.20, up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum compares favourably internationally. For example, in the UK, the weekly rate is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum. </p>  <p>  Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to a remote worker, or that amount doesn&rsquo;t sufficiently cover the additional cost borne by the employee as a result of working from home, the employee may be entitled to claim Remote Working Relief, which is provided for in section 114A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997. This measure allows employees, subject to satisfying certain conditions, to claim an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the relevant cost of electricity, heating and broadband for the days spent working from home as a remote worker.  </p>  <p>  Revenue has advised that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a benefit-In-kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. In addition, the provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a benefit-in-kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental. These exemptions are provided for in section 118 TCA 1997.</p>  <p>  Finally, comprehensive guidance material on the range of measures available to remote workers is published on the Revenue website. Detailed material is included in Tax and Duty Manual Part 05-02-13 Remote Working Relief, which is available at: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-02-13.pdf.</p></reply>

Almost every advanced economy in the world is in the same position, with inflation rates of 8.3 and 9.1 per cent recorded in the US and euro area respectively in August.</p>  <p>  The key driver of the elevated level of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy, food and other commodity prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine. However, as highlighted in the correspondence, pass-through price effects from higher energy prices are increasingly being felt in other sectors. Indeed, non-energy or &lsquo;core&rsquo; inflation has picked up sharply in recent months and stood at 6.2 per cent in August, suggesting inflationary pressures are increasingly broad based.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the impact rising prices have had on households and businesses across the country and has taken significant action. Some &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures has been announced since last October. Looking ahead, the Government will continue to address these challenges head on. Budget 2023 will be a &lsquo;Cost of Living Budget&rsquo; and will build on the fiscal supports the Government has already provided to cushion the impact of rising prices. </p>  <p>  The Government supported households and firms through the pandemic and will continue to do so in the face of unprecedented energy price spikes caused by Putin&rsquo;s war. However, we must be cognisant that resources are limited and while government policy will absorb some of the price shock, we cannot cushion households and businesses from the entire impact. The Government has to balance the appropriate response to the increased cost of living in Ireland with the unprecedented level of global economic uncertainty and macroeconomic risk. Furthermore, in calibrating how we respond to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure that policy doesn&rsquo;t inadvertently add further inflationary pressures into the system.</p></reply>

The Group B threshold (currently &euro;32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant such as a grandchild of the disponer. The Group C threshold (currently &euro;16,250) applies in all other cases. </p>  <p>  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts or inheritances that are in excess of his or her relevant tax-free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess benefit.</p>  <p>  While a disponer may have no natural children, any stepchildren, adopted children or certain foster children can avail of the Group A threshold in respect of gifts and inheritances received from that disponer.</p>  <p>  In addition, nieces or nephews of that disponer may qualify for favourite niece or favourite nephew relief in respect of gifts or inheritances of business assets. The relief allows a niece or nephew who qualifies for the relief to avail of the Group A threshold. Qualifying nieces or nephews are those who have worked substantially on a full-time basis for a period of five years prior to the gift or inheritance being given in carrying on, or assisting in the carrying on, the trade, business or profession, of the disponer.</p>  <p>  For the nephew or niece to be deemed to be working substantially on a full-time basis in the business he or she must work:</p>  <p>  - more than 24 hours per week at the place where the business, trade or profession is carried on; or</p>  <p>  - more than 15 hours per week at the place where the business, trade or profession is carried on exclusively by the disponer, any spouse or civil partner of the disponer and the nephew or niece.</p>  <p>  Recent Revenue estimates put the full cost of increasing the CAT Group A threshold alone from its current &euro;335,000 to &euro;400,000, for example, at approximately &euro;47 million. The full cost of increasing the CAT B threshold from its current &euro;32,500 to &euro;35,000 is approximately &euro;8 million. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that there is an exemption from CAT where dwelling houses are bequeathed by individuals who live there to successors who:</p>  <p>  - have lived there for a specified period of time before the inheritance,</p>  <p>  - will continue to live there for a specified period of time after the inheritance, and</p>  <p>  - who have no beneficial interest in any other residential property at the date of the inheritance.</p>  <p>  The policy rationale behind the dwelling house exemption is to protect the family home by ensuring that a beneficiary who has been living with the disponer, and will continue to reside there after the inheritance, does not have to sell that family home to pay a CAT liability and thus will continue to have somewhere to live.</p>  <p>  The options available for providing increases to CAT thresholds are considered in the context of available resources as part of the annual budgetary and Finance Bill process and, like all matters, need to be balanced against competing demands.</p></reply>

Vehicles restricted to on-site, industrial operations will be reviewed thereafter.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has a policy in place to purchase electric or hybrid cars (where available and operationally feasible). The percentage of hybrid/electric cars purchased by the NTMA has increased from 7% at the beginning of 2022 to 29% in Q3 2022.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is committed to its procurement obligations under The European Communities (Clean and Energy-Efficient Road Transport Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. No. 381 of 2021) to meet the minimum targets for the share of &lsquo;clean&rsquo; vehicles in procurements undertaken by public sector bodies over the relevant service contract value thresholds.  It continues to engage with all relevant stakeholders, including the Office of Public Works (OPW), in its plans to increase the number of electric/hybrid vehicles in the corporate fleet. In advance of placing orders for Electric Vehicles (EV), a budget allocation for 2023 has been applied for to cover the projected expenditure for the installation of onsite charging infrastructure in selected Revenue buildings. </p>  <p>  Revenue made a successful application to the Electric Vehicle Commercial Fleet Trial being run by Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI), and their partners Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and has very recently received an offer of a 3-month trial of an electric passenger vehicle. It is currently undertaking an EV Suitability Assessment to identify vehicles that are most suitable for early replacement by an EV. This involves reviewing the mileage and journey requirements of its fleet on an individual vehicle basis. The results of the EV Commercial Fleet trial, together with the results of Revenue&rsquo;s EV Suitability Assessment will inform its vehicle procurement and Green Fleet Strategy, which will form part of Revenue&rsquo;s overall approach to reduce energy and carbon emissions by 51% by the year 2030.</p></reply>

This will reduce the cost that customers may incur by potentially having two current accounts open at once during the mass migration of accounts.</p><p>While I welcome these actions, as Minister for Finance, I do not have a direct function in the operations of any bank. Although the State is a shareholder in some of the banks operating in the State, they must be run on a commercial and independent basis.</p><p>The charging of fees is a commercial decision for regulated entities, but this is subject to the regulatory framework which is the responsibility of the Central Bank of Ireland. Under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, credit institutions must notify the Central Bank if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges, in respect of the provision of any of the following services: </p><p>- making and receiving and receiving payments; </p><p>- providing foreign exchange facilities; </p><p>- providing and granting credit; </p><p>- maintaining and administrating transaction accounts. </p><p>Each notification received by the Central Bank is assessed in accordance with the specific criteria set out in Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. The Central Bank may either approve (in full or at lower levels than requested) or reject a credit institution&rsquo;s application under Section 149. In fulfilling its statutory role under Section 149, the Central Bank assesses these notifications in accordance with the following specific assessment criteria as set out in the legislation: </p><p>- the promotion of fair competition; </p><p>- the commercial justification; </p><p>- the effect new charges or increases in existing charges will have on customers; and </p><p>- passing on costs to customers. </p><p>Approvals are issued in the form of a letter of direction and the entity is legally bound to comply with this letter of direction. The letter of direction sets out the maximum amount the credit institution is allowed to charge. Credit institutions are free to impose any pricing differentials for the service up to the permitted maximum and are free to waive fees at their discretion for commercial or competitive reasons. </p><p>The letter of direction also sets out that credit institutions must publish the charges to be imposed on notices, leaflets, and promotional material etc. which should be made available to customers and on the credit institutions website if appropriate (the withdrawal of the fees will also be notified to the relevant customers prior to withdrawal).</p><p>Where a regulated entity intends to introduce new charges or increase any existing charges, under provision 6.18 of the Consumer Protection Code, it must give notice to affected consumers of the introduction of any new charges or of increases in charges, specifying the old and new charge, at least 30 days prior to the charge taking effect. </p><p>In relation to current account fees, the Deputy may wish to note that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission operates a comparison tool for current accounts (including information on fees) on its website. This can be used by consumers to find the account which best meets their needs.</p></reply>

The expense should apply to all employees in that category and not be discretionary. Revenue has advised me that it will consider FRE applications where a large number of employees incur broadly identical qualifying expenses which are not reimbursed by their employer. </p><p>Applications are generally made by the representative bodies in the employment sectors concerned and are considered by Revenue based on the specific commonality of expenses within the employment category and compliance with the strictly applied statutory requirement for a tax deduction.  </p><p><b>Childcare workers</b></p><p>I am advised by Revenue that a submission was received from one body which represents early years educators in 2017, and having considered the submission, Revenue was not in a position to apply a flat rate expense, as the expenses were not wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the employment.  Furthermore, correspondence was received from a separate representative body which represents early years educators in 2018 requesting a flat rate expense, however, to date no submission has been received. Should Revenue receive a submission it will be considered. </p><p><b>Beauticians and hairdressers </b></p><p>I am advised by Revenue that they received correspondence in 2021 from the Hair and Beauty Industry Confederation (HABIC) which is the representative body for the personal grooming industry (beauticians, hairdressers, barbers, nail tech, spa therapists, skin specialists etc.). However, to date no submission has been received. Should Revenue receive a submission it will be considered. </p><p>A flat rate expense for cosmetologists was introduced many years ago following engagement between Revenue and a society representing qualified therapists, providing skin care treatments, who were obliged to supply and launder their own white uniforms.  This FRE allowance however is specific to employees in this category only.  </p><p>Finally, Revenue advises me that it remains committed to the FRE regime and encourages all taxpayers to avail of their full tax relief entitlements.  It should be noted that all employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent to which the expenses are not reimbursed by the employer.</p></reply>

All sectors of the economy had to contribute to the recovery plan and the levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefited from over many years. It was introduced to support the recovery of the wider economy and was time bound in duration. For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, the rate was 0.60% of the pension scheme assets. For the year 2014, the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. The levy was successful and did its job as reflected in the increased activity and employment in that sector.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the amount of pension levy collected for the relevant years is as published on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/receipts/stamp-duty-receipts.pdf</p>  <p>  I have no plans to repay the levies paid on private pension funds. I do not consider it financially viable or appropriate that the savings achieved over the period of the financial emergency would be annulled, in whole or in part, by making retrospective payments.  The value of the funds raised by way of the levies have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to support the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers who may have ultimately borne the impact of the levy will have since benefited from tax reductions in the last number of Budgets.</p></reply>

It is my understanding that generally insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply. These can include: age; health; family medical history; occupation; and lifestyle. In addition, these may be determined or linked to the policy duration. In the case of mortgage protection policies, these tend to be over the lifetime of the repayment schedule. In addition, my understanding is that different insurers do not use the same combination of rating factors.  Accordingly, prices and availability of cover varies across the market, and will be priced in accordance with firms&rsquo; prior claims experience.</p><p>My officials have previously engaged with Insurance Ireland about accessing life insurance for individuals with medical conditions. According to Insurance Ireland, it is not standard practice to automatically decline cover for any cohort of applicants. It stated that insurers are obliged to assess the risk involved as part of any application for a life insurance policy, which will be specific to the individual applicant, and that the availability of cover depends on a number of factors. In this regard, I understand that applicants are asked questions about various conditions in order for insurers to assess the risk involved, and that all applicants are assessed against the same criteria. If higher risk is identified as a result of this assessment, Insurance Ireland has advised that the policy will be adjusted accordingly, and cover may be declined if the applicant poses a risk beyond the insurer&rsquo;s threshold.</p><p>It may be useful for the Deputy to know that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu.  Where somebody feels they have been treated unfairly by a particular insurance provider, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO acts as an independent arbiter of disputes that consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products, nor can we compel any insurer operating in the Irish market to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses. This position is reinforced by the EU framework (the <i>Solvency II</i>Directive) for insurance companies.</p></reply>

The IHREC eLearning module &ldquo;Equality and Human Rights in the Public Service&rdquo; is now available on OneLearning&rsquo;s learning management system and to date over 1100 Civil Servants have enrolled for this module. In addition, an extensive learning needs analysis for the Civil Service, conducted by OneLearning in 2021, identified Equality, Diversity and Inclusion as a key learning need.  52 new training courses are currently in various stages of design and roll out at this point in time and all of the new courses, where appropriate, are addressing Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, with a number of courses specifically being developed to address EDI and the Public Sector Duty.  IHREC have worked closely with OneLearning throughout all stages of the process and are involved with the development of the course content.</p></reply>

Irish Water takes a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements. The prioritisation and progression of individual projects is a matter for determination by Irish Water.</p>  <p>  Under Part 5 of the Water Services (No.2) Act 2013, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is the economic regulator of Irish Water. The CRU protects the water consumer by ensuring, among other things, that water services are provided by Irish Water in an economic and efficient manner.</p>  <p>  The CRU is responsible for setting the total level of revenue which Irish Water can receive, through Government subvention and from non-domestic customers, to cover its costs. To determine that these costs are efficiently-incurred, the CRU reviews Irish Water&rsquo;s investment plans and sets allowed amounts for its operational and capital costs. The cost of providing domestic water services (other than excess usage) is met through Exchequer funding through the annual budgetary and estimates process, having regard to the regulatory process undertaken by the CRU.</p>  <p>  In July 2022, the CRU published a consultation paper: Irish Water Revenue Control 3 &ndash; Interim Review (CRU202267) in which the CRU outlined the drivers of inflation and their impact on both the operation of Irish Water and its capital investment program. To address this, Irish Water has proposed that some of the Revenue Control 3 (RC3) 2020 - 2024 ring fenced funds for both the Water Supply Project &ndash; East and Midlands and the Greater Dublin Drainage projects could be used more broadly across the portfolio to absorb the impact of inflationary pressure.</p>  <p>  The CRU consultation paper sought feedback on the release of funds and sought a submission from Irish Water regarding the balance of ring fenced funds not consumed by inflationary adjustments, and how these could be used to deliver incremental benefits to water and wastewater consumers. This information has been provided by Irish Water and the CRU is now actively considering its response as part of a final decision paper, which will be published on www.cru.ie. In this paper the CRU will set out the total amount to be release as well as any incremental outputs and outcomes that it expects Irish Water to meet by the end or RC3.  Additionally, any decision paper will provide information on how the CRU intends monitoring any additional investment and ensuring that Irish Water delivers value for money. </p>  <p>  The Water Supply Project &ndash; Eastern and Midlands is at the Preliminary Business Case (PBC) Stage of the Public Spending Code, which aims to develop further the strategic case for the project, consider in more detail the range of options available and decide whether there is a case for proceeding with the proposal. The PBC incorporates detailed options appraisal and when finalised will also incorporate assessments of risk along with the proposed approach to implementation of the proposal. </p>  <p>  In addition to their role as economic regulator of Irish Water, the CRU will carry out an external assurance process of the Water Supply Project &ndash; Eastern and Midlands Region PBC and issue guidance to my Department.</p>  <p>  Under the Public Spending Code major projects such as the Water Supply Project &ndash; Eastern and Midlands Region must have their PBC approved by Government in order to proceed. I understand that Irish Water intend to seek Government approval for the PBC following the completion of the CRU external assurance process in late 2023/early 2024.</p>  <p>  The future funding of the Water Supply Project &ndash; Eastern and Midlands will be included in the Irish Water Capital Investment Plan 2025 &ndash; 2029 that will be submitted to the CRU as part of Revenue Control 4 (RC4) 2025 &ndash; 2025, which in turn will be subject to the Irish Water funding model (Exchequer subvention - Domestic customer and Non-Domestic tariffs).  </p>  <p>  Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  The team can be contacted via email to oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 0818 578 578.</p></reply>

Key considerations in this review included the type of structure (administrative/professional staff) necessary to deliver affordable housing, scale of delivery programmes and alignment with the additional support already provided for social housing delivery earlier in 2022. </p>  <p>  The draft local authority staffing strategy for the delivery of affordable housing over the lifetime of NDP has been concluded at official level and is now subject to on-going engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  This is a key requirement to underpin affordable housing delivery and concluding this exercise and putting the required structures in place with the support of the LGMA to enable affordable housing delivery is a matter of priority.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-20a.570.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092000068#WRL02800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 262 together.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Foreshore Unit operates the consenting regime under the Foreshore Act 1933, managing the regulation of a range of different marine activities and infrastructural developments. The volume of applications made under the Act in recent years has grown significantly. In parallel, my Department is leading an extensive marine management reform programme, the likes of which the State has never seen. </p>  <p>  The expected time for processing and determining foreshore applications can vary considerably and is influenced by the quality of the application and supporting documents received, the nature and complexity of the application, the level of public engagement during the consultation process and up until recently, impacts from restrictions imposed as a result of Covid-19, among other matters. Each application must be assessed appropriately in accordance with the applicable requirements of domestic and EU law including the EIA Directive, Birds and Habitats Regulations and the Foreshore Act. Several of the foreshore consents issued in recent years have been the subject of judicial review proceedings and the process for assessing such applications has been amended as a result, taking into account legal advices and evolving case law. </p>  <p>  A range of foreshore consents related to offshore energy infrastructure granted under the Foreshore Act 1933 in recent years have been assessed and prioritized in tandem with the other high level Government objectives in the maritime space. Specific consents relate to strategic energy interconnectors e.g. Greenlink Interconnector, Celtic Interconnector; applications relating to a range of port developments e.g. Shannon Foynes, Rosslare Harbour, Dublin Port and Cork Ports. In parallel, other foreshore lease and licence applications, not related to energy infrastructure, that have been considered and consented include telecommunication cables, waste water treatment facilities, strategic infrastructure, flood relief works, local authorities&rsquo; infrastructural works e.g. bridges, marinas, coastal protection works, coastal protection projects and public amenities etc. Details for foreshore applications and determinations are available on my Department's website: www.gov.ie/en/collection/f2196-foreshore-applications-and-determinations/</p>  <p>  A further proportion of foreshore applications on hand include licence applications for site investigations within the foreshore area linked to the proposed development of offshore renewable energy projects. The site investigations are critical activities developers undertake in order to investigate viability and prepare environmental impact assessments of potential future offshore renewable energy infrastructure. </p>  <p>  My Department has also been prioritising site investigation licence applications linked to qualified ORE projects, known as "relevant projects" or Phase 1 projects, which qualify to make an application to the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications for a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) as part of the transition provisions in the MAP Act 2021. Any project in this category granted a MAC by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must then apply for the necessary development permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the new marine planning system. I have consented to fifteen site investigation licences for Phase 1 Relevant projects in recent years and a further 8 applications are under assessment and will conclude shortly.  My Department has also been managing the other caseload of site investigation applications not associated with Phase 1. In that context, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications concluded a public consultation on the criteria for the second batch or Phase 2 projects in quarter 1 of this year and is currently considering how to proceed.</p>  <p>  The Government last week approved the prioritisation of renewable energy plans and projects in the Irish maritime area, as a direct response to the energy and climate crises. This decision follows on from the recently agreed Government ambitions for an increase of offshore wind energy, which targets the delivery of an additional 2GW of offshore wind for the production of green hydrogen. Following this decision, the Government&rsquo;s intention is that the following projects in the maritime area will receive priority attention:</p>  <p>  - Any marine infrastructure projects that align with Government decisions to address risks to energy security of supply.</p>  <p>  - Projects that are capable of delivering 200MW or above of offshore renewable energy to meet domestic demand before 2030, using well established, proven technologies.</p>  <p>  - Infrastructure that will support delivery and deployment of Renewable Energy projects such as grid and port facilities.</p>  <p>  - Projects utilising emerging technology that may have the ability to assist the State in meeting its 2030 targets such as floating wind and green hydrogen</p>  <p>  To give effect to this decision, approval has also been given to the immediate development of a Statutory Marine Planning Policy Statement (MPPS) by my Department that will prioritise energy and energy-related projects above all other maritime activities during the six year lifetime of the MPPS. By taking this action, the State&rsquo;s consenting authorities, such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the soon to be established Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA) will prioritise the processing of renewable energy projects, including those that support the development of Offshore Renewable Energy infrastructure in both the marine and onshore. </p>  <p>  The Foreshore Unit in my Department is currently assessing the current caseload of foreshore lease and licence applications in the context of this Government decision. A key consideration will be how the significant number of site investigation licenses that are on hand and not associated with the Phase 1 projects can be managed given the priority status afforded across Government to applications associated with projects capable of delivering before 2030 using well established technologies.</p></reply>

The Foreshore Act 1933 requires that a lease or licence must be obtained from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government for the carrying out of works or placing structures or material on, or for the occupation of or removal of material from, State-owned foreshore, which represents the greater part of the foreshore. The Act provides for the issuing of licences or leases which are in the public interest and provides for the removal of any material within the foreshore and not more than thirty feet below the surface thereof.</p>  <p>  The position in relation to proposed geophysical survey activity involving sonar and echo sounding equipment and which are undertaken in a non-intrusive manner and do not place anything on or remove or disturb or interfere with the seabed or shore, is that a foreshore licence is not required under section 3 of the Foreshore Act 1933 on foot of recent legal advices. </p>  <p>  There are however, obligations on proposers intending to undertake such survey activity to seek Ministerial consent in accordance with the EC (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  The existing foreshore licence assessment process for both geophysical surveys and geotechnical-type activities may address all necessary assessments referred to above, because in determining whether to issue the licence the assessments referred to under the Regulations will be conducted.  The NPWS website provides guidance on obligations under The EC (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011-2021 and can be contacted directly by proposers who wish to discuss consent requirements arising.</p>  <p>  My Department is working to assess the implications of the recent legal advice with a view to streamlining consent processes in advance of the establishment of the new maritime area regulator - the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA) in 2023.</p>  <p>  In that context, the Foreshore Unit and NPWS are actively engaged with a view to developing a protocol which will provide clarity for applicants in this regard. I expect this to be concluded shortly.</p></reply>

Most of the funding from Central Government to local authorities must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into 5 broad programme categories: housing, transport, recreational, education and environment.</p>  <p>  My Department has a wide and diverse business agenda, covering a broad range of functions, including local authority housing, voluntary housing, homeless services, estate regeneration, energy efficiency retrofitting, housing grants, rural water schemes, urban renewal/regeneration, and fire services.   In order to achieve its business objectives, my Department allocates significant resources to an extensive range of organisations, including local authorities, dedicated agencies, and other bodies; some allocations, depending on the programmes concerned, are made on a national or other non-county basis in the form of grant funding.  </p>  <p>  Grant funding is provided primarily on the basis of vouched expenditure, as opposed to specific up front annual allocations, once all necessary requirements as detailed in grant assistance schemes are met by the bodies/organisations concerned and that appropriate systems and procedures are in place to ensure the exercise of proper financial controls.   Accordingly, the circumstances of funding being returned to the Central Exchequer through my Department do not generally arise. I'm not aware of any refund in respect of these grant programmes from the four Dublin local authorities between 2019 and 2021.</p>  <p>  However there was some funding returned to the Local Government Fund in respect of the Covid Commercial Rates Waiver/Support package.  In early 2021, Dublin City Council returned &euro;1,095,036 and Dun Laoghaire/ Rathdown County Council returned &euro;10,196 in respect of the 2020 rates waiver.  Similarly in March 2022, South Dublin County Council returned &euro;70,148 in respect of the 2021 waiver.</p></reply>

Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 75,000 homes have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;184 million under the scheme.</p>  <p>  In response to the Programme for Government commitment, my Department launched a newly revised ten year Energy Efficiency Programme in 2021 for local authority owned housing. This new programme set a BER performance requirement of &ldquo;B2&rdquo; or cost optimal level. The upscaling of the works included in the programme sees a substantial overall increase in funding being made available for insulation, windows and doors and heating upgrades, specifically the installation of a Heat Pump and associated works. The installation of gas/oil boilers are no longer supported under the energy efficiency programme funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  An annualised breakdown of the funding provided and the number of properties upgraded under the Energy Efficiency Retrofit programme for the years 2013-2021 is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/668c1-energy-efficiency-retrofitting-programme-expenditure-output/</p>  <p>  My Department announced earlier this year that funding will be provided for the upgrade of approximately 2,400 social homes this year, of which 304 have been allocated to Dublin City Council, 68 allocated to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, 81 allocated to Fingal and 146 allocated to South Dublin County Council.  Work in this regard is underway but it will be later this year before significant recoupment claims are lodged with my Department. Full details in relation to the 2022 EERP will be available early in 2023.</p></reply>

Full details can be found at www.gov.ie/en/press-release/328d7-minister-obrien-welcomes-progress-on-enhanced-defective-concrete-blocks-grant-scheme/.</p>  <p>  The actual number of applications and corresponding payments that are expected in 2023 are unknown. However, it is possible somewhat to estimate based on the numbers that have applied through the current scheme since it opened in 2020. The average number of applications per year from Donegal, over the same period, is 333 per year. </p>  <p>  Clare and Limerick will begin accepting applications to the Enhanced Scheme upon its commencement. The scale of the issue in Clare and Limerick is similar to that in Mayo so it would be reasonable to assume that the number of applications will not be significantly different than those from Mayo, which has an average of 95 applications per annum over the last 3 years. Therefore, the estimated number of applications in 2023 is 618 applications. </p>  <p>  Since the current scheme opened in 2020 the average grant amount approved for remediation works is &euro;221,869. Notwithstanding the potential impact of the enhanced scheme on the average value of approvals this would suggest that the value of approvals in 2023 could be of the order of &euro;137m. There is however a very considerable time lag between grant approval and the draw down of funding. Not all homeowners will start work immediately after receipt of approval. In addition, depending upon the remediation option being carried out, the works themselves can take anywhere between 2 and 15 months which can affect the value of funding drawn down in any particular year.</p></reply>

Key to this is the delivery of new social housing and boosting overall supply of homes.</p>  <p>  The Government is investing significantly in social and affordable housing, with record funding allocated for current and capital investment in housing this year alone. This year funding is in place to deliver 11,800 social homes, including 9,000 new build homes, thus building on the progress made last year when 9,183 new social homes were provided, a 17% increase on 2020.</p>  <p>  I established the National Homeless Action Committee (NHAC) with the immediate priority of examining measures to prevent homelessness. A number of Committee subgroups have been established to examine specific measures that have been identified. Progress on all prevention measures is discussed at each meeting of NHAC.</p>  <p>  To build upon this, local authorities will shortly participate in a Homelessness Prevention Workshop, run by the Housing Agency,  aimed at examining homelessness prevention and discussing the measures that are most impactful.</p>  <p>  The Youth Homelessness Strategy is now in the process of being finalised. Five key consultations for the strategy have now concluded. NHAC members will be invited to provide feedback on the final draft. It is anticipated that the Strategy will be published in Q4 2022.</p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) discretion rate has been increased to 35% and the couple&rsquo;s rate has now been expanded to single persons for new tenancies.  This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries into homelessness. Local authorities are prioritising tenancy support services, prevention and the use of the Placefinder service for HAP tenancies. </p>  <p>  The Housing Agency, in partnership with the HSE and in consultation with key Departments and agencies has developed a good practice guide for the operation of Assertive Street Outreach services. This guide is intended to be a flexible tool for sharing good practice and ideas for Assertive Street Outreach and will assist regions in expanding outreach services into areas in which rough sleeping is understood to be a concern. </p>  <p>  Following the success of the voids programme, which delivered over 6,000 units in 2020 and 2021, a new Voids programme has been introduced for 2022, with an emphasis on quick turnaround and re-letting of vacant social housing stock. In addition, in line with the commitment in Housing for All to support local authorities to drive take up of the enhanced Repair and Leasing scheme, the Government has recently approved a pilot expansion which will open the scheme to a wider range of owners, by removing the criteria that a property owner must be unable to fund or access funding to bring former vacant commercial and institutional buildings back into use under the Repair and Leasing scheme. These measures will increase supply of homes to those on social housing waiting lists, including those in emergency accommodation.</p>  <p>  Recently, I also reinstated the delegated sanction to local authorities in respect of social housing acquisitions that meet certain criteria.  This will allow local authorities more flexibility to secure acquisitions which support a household to exit or to prevent homelessness.</p>  <p>  We are providing more social homes, we are completing more homes in general and we have a strong pipeline of homes commenced. This supply activity, as well as targeted measures specifically centred on homelessness, will allow us to meet the challenge of eradicating homelessness.</p></reply>

The Fund is being delivered by local authorities, and will provide new choices for people to live in towns and villages in Ireland, initially through the provision of a grant to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, with priority given to areas where the level of vacancy or dereliction is high.</p><p>All local authorities were requested by my Department to engage in adequate tracking of the operation of the Fund including how many applications have submitted and how many applications have been approved to date.

The Act provides for the issuing of licences or leases which are in the public interest and provides for the removal of any material within the foreshore and not more than thirty feet below the surface thereof. </p>  <p>  The position in relation to proposed geophysical survey activity involving sonar and echo sounding equipment and which are undertaken in a non-intrusive manner and do not place anything on or remove or disturb or interfere with the seabed or shore, is that a foreshore licence is not required under section 3 of the Foreshore Act 1933 on foot of recent legal advices.  </p>  <p>  There are however, obligations on proposers intending to undertake such survey activity to seek Ministerial consent in accordance with the EC (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  The existing foreshore licence assessment process for both geophysical surveys and geotechnical-type activities may address all necessary assessments referred to above, because in determining whether to issue the licence the assessments referred to under the Regulations will be conducted.  The NPWS website provides guidance on obligations under The EC (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011-2021 and can be contacted directly by proposers who wish to discuss consent requirements arising. </p>  <p>  My Department is working to assess the implications of the recent legal advice with a view to streamlining consent processes in advance of the establishment of the new maritime area regulator - the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA) in 2023.</p>  <p>  In that context, the Foreshore Unit and the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department are actively engaged with a view to developing a protocol which will provide clarity for applicants in this regard.

The LDA is also currently preparing a report to the Government, which shall identify lands suitable for the purposes of the LDA Act. </p>  <p>  Under Action 19.9 of Housing for All it was also agreed that all Government Departments examine their existing portfolio of properties and, subject to any obligations under the Public Spending Code, the LDA Act 2021 or the State Property Act 1954, would place them on the market if they were not required and may be suitable for residential housing. This would allow for more efficient use of those buildings and provide opportunities for individuals and families to convert suitable buildings into homes.</p>  <p>  In this context, my Department wrote to all Government Departments in December 2021 requesting that they review their respective portfolio of properties and assess what properties, if any, may be suitable for housing. All Departments have responded to this request and further direct engagement is now taking place, led by the State Lands Subgroup with those Departments who manage large property portfolios, albeit in the ownership of Office of Public Works (OPW), to identify potential underutilised properties which could be released for use for residential purposes. </p>  <p>  A Memorandum for Government was brought on 9 June 2022 updating Government on the ongoing work of the State Lands and Property Group. The Group is focused on identifying further potential sites suitable to support housing delivery and on timely re-purposing of these lands/properties for long-term residential use. Cabinet agreed to the establishment of a collaborative pilot programme, based on information available in both the LDA and OPW register of lands, along with local knowledge, to identify additional opportunities in a selection of local authorities.

It is intended that information across all delivery streams, including AHB delivery and LDA delivery, will be gathered centrally and I expect that my Department will be in a position to begin reporting on affordable delivery in national quarterly statistics later this year. </p><p>To date, six projects in four local authorities have advertised a cumulative total of 325 affordable purchase homes.

Approximately 300 CREL funded homes have been delivered to date in 2022.</p><p>Cost Rental properties are also in development by Local Authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) and 50 Cost Rental homes tenanted in Enniskerry Road earlier this year were supported by c &euro;4.5m in Departmental funding. The AHF will help to facilitate a Local Authority-led financing structure for Cost Rental, which will provide important opportunities for Local Authorities to directly delivery Cost Rental homes on their own lands, such as at Emmet Road in Dublin City.</p><p>The LDA will also deliver Cost Rental as well as affordable purchase homes on its own portfolio of sites or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh.  Project Tosaigh is a market engagement initiative to unlock land with full planning permission that is not being developed by private sector owners.The LDA has advised that it will deliver both cost rental and affordable purchase homes via Project Tosaigh before year end.  Full details will be made public as commercial arrangements are concluded.

I wish to assure the Deputy that we are closely monitoring reports of the recently intensified crackdown on religious leaders, including those of the Catholic Church, which are cause for serious concern, and we are gravely concerned at the by the recent detention of [this person].</p>  <p>  Since this crackdown began, Ireland, along with our EU partners, has repeatedly urged the Nicaraguan authorities to put an end to all repression and to restore full respect for human rights, including freedom of expression and freedom of religion or belief. We have also consistently reiterated calls for the release of all political prisoners, expressed grave concern over the treatment of those prisoners, and called for judicial independence and due process to be respected. </p>  <p>  The expulsion of dozens of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) from the country, as well as the expulsion of international human rights bodies and the Organisation of American States, constitute further examples of Nicaragua&rsquo;s backsliding on human rights and its withdrawal from the global rules-based order. We have called on the Nicaraguan authorities to re-engage with these bodies. </p>  <p>  At the recent 51st session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Ireland made clear once again to the Nicaraguan authorities its concern over the above-mentioned issues, highlighting in its national statement the repression of all dissenting voices, including religious leaders, and calling on the authorities to restore respect for freedom of religion or belief. The same calls were reiterated in the EU's statement on Nicaragua during the same session.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the EU sanctions in place on various individuals and entities that are responsible for serious human rights violations in Nicaragua. Ireland is prepared to support any additional EU measures that are aimed at supporting democratic norms and human rights in Nicaragua and that do not impact negatively on the population.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the solidarity of the Irish people with the people of Nicaragua, Ireland provided just under &euro;12 million in funding between 2012 and 2021. This funding focused on the areas of governance and human rights, gender equality, food security, nutrition and environmental sustainability, and was channelled through Irish NGOs. Given the hostile situation towards NGOs in Nicaragua, discussions with partners in relation to the appropriate channelling of bilateral funding for 2022 are ongoing; funding is likely to target access to, and sustainable use of, natural resources, and tackle gender-based violence amongst Nicaraguan migrant women who have had to flee the country. We will also continue to support EU programmes in Nicaragua that are designed to assist the Nicaraguan people.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that we will continue working to support the people of Nicaragua however possible, through our engagement in Dublin, at EU level, and on the ground through our Embassy in Mexico, in order to support a return to democratic norms and to protection of fundamental freedoms.</p></reply>

Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p><p>Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p><p>In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p><p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level be continued for the 2022/2023 school year.

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures. </p>  <p>  Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport.

Details of these adjustments were issued to schools on 8 September 2022 to ensure that students and staff could familiarise themselves with any changes, thus providing as much clarity and certainty to students as possible at the start of the school year. </p>  <p>  These arrangements acknowledge the disruption faced by these students because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I consider that these arrangements are proportionate to the students&rsquo; experience and loss of learning, and are educationally appropriate. The adjustments ensure that the overall structure of exams remains intact but allows for greater choice for students. </p>  <p>  In relation to Music specifically, the adjustments published recently are in line with the adjustments that were put in place for students at this stage of the school year in 2020 and 2021, the difference being that Group B set works are replaced with Group A set works. As it is not possible for technical reasons to add more choice in an aural paper, it is envisaged that informing teachers and students as to the movements that would not be assessed would ease the workload at revision time. Extra choice has been given in relation to the only question on the paper for which that is possible. </p></reply>

While the issue of pay alone will not resolve these issues, the Government is committed to the delivery of quality public services, and will continue to approach public service pay in a balanced way that is reasonable and fair to both public servants and the taxpayer. There is an important balance to be struck between maintaining industrial peace and protecting the Exchequer.  </p><p>The value of public pay deals to the Government and the taxpayer is ensuring that pay costs are managed in a sustainable and orderly way and in a climate of industrial peace. By and large public pay agreements have delivered on these objectives over the last 12 years.  Following the conclusion of discussions on 30 August, the parties to Building Momentum, with the expert assistance of the WRC who oversaw the talks' process, have come forward with a set of proposals, to extend the terms of Building Momentum to 31 December 2023. Government have approved these proposals which have been published in full. It is now a matter for public service unions and associations representing the public service workforce to consider and ballot on those proposals. The proposals, if adopted by unions and staff representative associations, will provide stability in a period of significant global uncertainty. It is appropriate at this time to allow space for the respective union and association memberships to reflect on the proposals. </p><p>In recent years my Department has established a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of teachers at both post-primary and primary levels, including the introduction of new programmes of initial teacher education and teacher upskilling programmes in targeted subject areas and the Teaching Transforms campaign, which encourages young people to follow a career in teaching. </p><p>I have allocated significant additional posts to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue, bringing the total to 610 posts on 151 panels, covering approximately 2,800 schools, including the large majority of primary schools in urban areas.  The supply panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as <b><i>Sub Seeker</i></b>, the national substitution portal service operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed. </p><p>The Teaching Council is also currently processing applications for registration from newly qualified teachers, who will represent a new source of supply in 2022/23. In excess of 3,200 primary and post-primary NQTs are registered to date with almost 100 further applications currently in progress.</p></reply>

This includes additional teaching and care supports.</p><p>As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>Over the last two years, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year. My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand. </p><p>I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen 383 new special classes open, bringing the total number of special classes to 2,535 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 383 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 253 at primary and 130 at post primary level.</p><p>The list of special classes for the 2022/23 school year is available on the NCSE website at the link below.</p><p>06Jul22_Special-Classes-for-publication-2022_2023.pdf (ncse.ie)</p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an ongoing identified need for additional special education placements for primary and post-primary students with autism. Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years in these areas to meet the demand for places. </p><p>NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements. </p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for 2022/23 and beyond. Every support will be made available to schools to progress the opening of special classes in the shortest possible timeframe.</p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of additional special school provision with new special schools established in both Cork and Dublin.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

In relation to school admissions, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the area in question, may be viewed on my  Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can also be found on my Department's website at and this information is also updated regularly.</p><p>Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>The admission policy must comply with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018, be non-discriminatory and be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to draft, publish and implement a school admission policy in accordance with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018.</p><p>Where a board of management make a decision to refuse admission, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, and an independent appeals committee will be appointed to consider the appeal. The role of the section 29 hearing committee is to examine the application for enrolment and consider if it was correctly processed by the school, in accordance with the school&rsquo;s Enrolment Policy. The section 29 appeals committee cannot consider matters that are not provided for within the school&rsquo;s Enrolment Policy. If a parent considers that a school has erred in their processing of their enrolment application, a section 29 appeal committee can examine how their application was processed by the school and identify if the school did not follow its Enrolment policy.  In cases where an error occurred the section 29 appeal committee will consider if the error had a material effect on their application. Where an error had a material effect on their enrolment application, the section 29 appeal committee can direct the school to enrol the student or adjust the students ranking on the waiting list.This Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned.</p><p>A section 29 appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p><p>It is important to note that if a parent have been refused admission due to the school being oversubscribed, and they wish to appeal this decision they must firstly make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child.</p><p>If a parent have been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, the parent may, but are not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the  child.  Where the parent have been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and do not choose to seek a review by the board of management  the parent  may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p><p>Full details on the section 29 appeals process for refused enrolment are available on the Gov.ie  website at the links below: ; .</p><p>In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS) the Educational Welfare Service  is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child.

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements of this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,300 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. Most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025.</p><p>A list of all capital projects completed under the Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme, in county order, from 2010 to date may be viewed my Department&rsquo;s website at .This is updated on a monthly basis to reflect their progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction.</p><p>My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.</p><p>New renewable technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements under the research programme.  Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments through my Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents, which set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency. The Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website . which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p><p>Schools designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the 2019 Building Regulations,  along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.</p><p>The Department have been using test schools to evaluate the suitability of renewable energy options for schools over the past twenty plus years. Nearly 60 % of the research programme features renewable aspects. These renewables include wind generation, solar hot water heating, photovoltaics, rain water recovery, geothermal heat pumps, air source heat pumps and biomass heating systems. Results have varied with respect to their applicability in a school environment.  Research continues in many areas.</p><p>My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.</p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector. </p><p>The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland.</p><p>The pathfinder programme builds on significant investment by the Department of Education in energy efficiency through the 2009/10 Cavity and Attic Insulation/Water Conservation Scheme and ongoing Summer Works and refurbishment projects.</p><p>The upgrades target a Building Energy Rating of B, 50% energy efficiency improvement and 51% emissions reduction. The works typically involves upgrades to the building fabric including wall and roof insulation, doors and windows, air tightness improvements, LED lighting and heating upgrades as well as renewable technologies.</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s current approach to heating systems provides for direct modulating high efficiency gas boiler systems. This approach takes into account future proofing to ensure school buildings are renewable compatible and are able to take advantage of developing technologies as they become viable, thus enabling a Just Transition for school management, teachers, pupils and parents. </p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 Annex of Actions published earlier this year actions the Department to confirm its decarbonisation pathway trajectory to meet 2030 and 2050 targets for the schools sector by end of 2022.</p><p>Work is ongoing on decarbonisation options for schools with a focus on the standard of required design criteria and specification to achieve a net zero energy school building and establishing the trajectory for the integration of suitable solutions on a phased basis in a risk controlled manner providing a credible cost effective transition to zero carbon school buildings while ensuring no delays to school accommodation delivery.</p><p>The attached list shows the list of New School Buildings Completed since 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="6">List of New School Buildings completed 2020 to date</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>County</td>       <td>Roll No.</td>       <td>School </td>       <td>School Type</td>       <td>Year</td>       <td>Building Type</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>19439B</td>       <td>Holy Family Ss, Cootehill</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>2021</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>19993E</td>       <td>Gaelscoil An Ghort Alainn, Aibinne Murmont, Gort Alainn</td>       <td>Primary</td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>New School Building</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>19881Q</td>       <td>Gaelscoil Charraig U&iacute;

Supplementing these universal supports, the DEIS programme provides a targeted and equitable way to address concentrated educational disadvantage that promotes equity and has benefits for students.</p>  <p>  In this regard the DEIS programme targets the highest levels of resources at those schools that have been identified for DEIS Urban Band 1 status. Schools in this band are those that have been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  Schools in DEIS Urban band 1 receive a more beneficial staffing schedule allowing for the provision of smaller class sizes. They also receive priority access to the support of the National Educational Psychological Service, as well as access to the School Completion and School Meals programme. As with all urban schools, schools in this band receive home school community liaison support. Schools in Urban Band 1 receive a DEIS grant which reflects their high level of concentrated disadvantage.</p>  <p>  A number of supports are currently being offered to schools to support wellbeing and mental health in line with my Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice. There are a number of programmes and initiatives available, such as training for all schools from the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) on embedding wellbeing at the core of school ethos and training from the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for school staff on the Friends for Life and Incredible Years programmes, on using therapeutic informed approaches and responding to critical incidents. </p>  <p>  While the Department of Health has responsibility for mental health services in Ireland, my Department has an important role to support the wellbeing and positive mental health of all our young people. My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE has responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs including the allocation of SNAs and reviews. My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process. The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. I recognise the need to target resources to those schools who need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders and will consider information provided by schools in correspondence to my Department.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index when available can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

Teachers are equipped to make such decisions as a result of their initial teacher education and the ongoing support provided by the Professional Developmeent Service for Teachers (PDST). </p><p>There are also protocols in place to ensure that strict criteria are observed by schools when inviting external agencies to address students about particular issues.</p><p>The issue of alcohol misuse is addressed in the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances. As students progress through the SPHE programme, they encounter a wide range of issues, including substance misuse. Schools have a role to play in supporting their students to develop the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make informed choices when faced with difficult issues, including drugs, alcohol and gambling.</p><p>SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in Junior Cycle, where it forms part of the mandatory 'Wellbeing' area of learning. Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.</p><p>Relevant topics in SPHE include student decision-making skills and safety and protection. Students learn how to exercise judgement, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices that guide them towards considered decision-making, begin to understand their own rights and the rights of others, and explore decision-making. In respect of safety, students&rsquo; ability to assess the consequences of risky behaviour is also developed.</p><p>In 2020, the NCCA established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in the area of SPHE/RSE curricular redevelopment and support the development of guidance material for schools.  </p><p>The immediate focus of the work of the NCCA has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE/RSE may be approached in a more holistic way.</p><p>In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum is underway. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification was published for consultation on 18 July, with the consultation process running until 18 October. The consultation will take feedback from teachers and students as well as other interested groups and individuals and I would encourage anyone with an interest in this area to engage with the consultation. More information on the consultation process, including how to contribute to it, is available on the NCCA&rsquo;s website.</p><p>It is expected that the finalised Junior Cycle specification will be presented to Council for approval by the end of this year, before being sent to me for approval ahead of planned implementation in schools in September 2023. The draft updated specification provides clear direction on the knowledge and skills that all students should gain during the 3 years of Junior Cycle SPHE. It places a strong focus on the development of important life skills that young people need growing up in a fast changing and complex world.</p><p>For example, the draft Junior Cycle SPHE specifications addresses the issue of alcohol and addiction in Strand 2: Making healthy choices. The learning outcomes of this strand includes investigating how unhealthy products are markets and advertised to appeal to young people; analysing the supports and challenges for young people when it comes to healthy choices about addictive substances and overcoming them; and discussing the physical, social, and legal consequences of their own or others&rsquo; use of addictive substances. The topic is also touched in Strand 4 - Emotional wellbeing, where students explore the potential impact of substance us on mental health.</p><p>A background paper that will inform the updating of senior cycle SPHE/RSE is intended to be brought to Council this month. This will be followed by a period of consultation. It is intended that the curriculum redevelopment work will commence in October with the first meeting of the development group. A draft updated curriculum for senior cycle SPHE will be ready for public consultation by summer 2023 and finalised in early 2024 for implementation in schools in September 2024.</p><p>Following publication of the Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, the NCCA will establish a development group which is due to commence development on updated primary specifications in Quarter 4 2022, with a draft estimated to be available for public consultation in Quarter 1 2024.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes. Independent evaluation is a central part of the project and the outcome will inform future policy on extending the SIM. The project includes a number of elements:</p>  <p>  - Provision of in-school therapies (speech and language, occupational)</p>  <p>  - Allocation of SNAs on a frontloaded basis</p>  <p>  - Training of SNAs</p>  <p>  A demonstration project to provide in-school and pre-school therapy services took place over the course of the 2018/19 school year. The project was developed by the Department, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Department of Health, and the Health Service Executive and managed and co-ordinated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).</p>  <p>  The purpose of the project was to test a model of tailored therapeutic supports by providing speech and language and occupational therapy within &lsquo;educational settings&rsquo;. This innovative pilot complemented existing HSE funded provision of essential therapy services.  </p>  <p>  The project took place in the Health Service Executive (HSE) Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) 7 Region of South West Dublin, Kildare and West Wicklow. 75 schools (of which includes 22 schools that are in the DEIS programme), including a representative sample of primary, post-primary, and special schools took part. 75 pre-school settings associated with primary schools participating in the project were included. In total 150 settings participated in the demonstration project.  Children who require speech and language therapy services on a one-to-one basis continue to access services from the Health Service Executive. The in-school therapy model was designed to supplement, not to replace existing services. The aim of the Demonstration Project was to design a therapeutic support model for the school setting that would lead to better outcomes for the children.  It involved the development of a continuum of support, specialist, targeted and universal supports, in line with best practice for students.    </p>  <p>  The project was evaluated over the course of the 2018/19 school year and this was positively evaluated.</p>  <p>  In February 2019, the Government approved the trialling of the Model for the 2019/20 school year. Initially designed as a one year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CH07 region, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid-19 related work. It was then extended to the 2020/21 school year which has also been interrupted by Covid-19. Progress has been made on aspects of the Model but much remains to be done in terms of in-school implementation and evaluation.  </p>  <p>  The Pilot has now recommenced in CHO7 and therapists are working within these schools and are providing ongoing support on a responsive basis to deliver therapy-based strategies and tools. Overall there is good engagement by the schools in CHO7. Planning for an expansion is underway.  The Department is consulting with relevant Departments including Taoiseach, Heath and Children. </p>  <p>  In relation to psychological therapeutic supports, the provision of child and adolescent mental health services lies specifically within the remit of the Department of Health and the HSE.  HSE Primary Care Psychology Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provide a range of clinical support to children and young people with mental health needs.  However, the Department of Education also plays an important role in supporting the wellbeing and mental health of our young people. The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  The approach set out in the Wellbeing Policy is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies, experience supportive relationships within the school setting and be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe. </p>  <p>  It is important that all children and young people feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported. Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. </p>  <p>  A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience.  My Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides a comprehensive psychological service to all primary and post primary schools. NEPS is a school-based service which means that all its psychologists work in schools with children, young people, teachers and parents, and are involved with school-related work, every day.  The NEPS psychologist provides a range of services that may include supporting the wellbeing and inclusion of an individual pupil, through assessment and intervention.  NEPS supports approximately 8000 individual children annually through this type of work.  NEPS work also supports teachers in their work through providing professional learning opportunities, such as about trauma informed approaches, supporting autistic children, or delivering the Friends for Life programmes to help reduce anxiety.  NEPS supports an estimated 25,000 teachers annually in this way.  </p>  <p>  The Department &ndash; through NEPS, Student Support Teams, Guidance Counsellors and other services - will also continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE/HSE-funded e-mental health services. The Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  </p></reply>

It is designed to nurture the child in all dimensions of his or her life&mdash;spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social and physical. The curriculum recognises the integrity of the child&rsquo;s life as a child and aims to cater for his or her needs and potential as they evolve day by day. By meeting these needs, the curriculum enriches the child&rsquo;s life and the foundations are laid for happiness and fulfilment in later education and in adult life. (DES, 1999, p. 6)</p><p>In 2020 the Teaching Council published C&eacute;im: Standards for Initial Teacher Education to support the development of student teachers to provide for the learning needs of all pupils.C&eacute;&iacute;m: Standards for Initial Teacher Education outlines Inclusive Education as a core element that underpins all aspects of the ITE programme, and the student teachers must demonstrate an understanding of inclusive education through reflection on their professional learning and practice, as appropriate to their stage of learning.</p><p>All new and existing programmes of Initial Teacher Education (ITE) will be aligned with C&eacute;im.</p><p>All Continuous Professional Development(CPD) opportunities and supporting frameworks included in Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) suite of teacher professional development supports prioritise the pupil/student as learner at the centre of its key messages, participant outcomes and associated activities. This mirrors that message which is evident within key governmental and Department of Education documents and strategies. </p><p>In addition to the above, currently within the primary context, teacher professional learning opportunities draw a lens to curricular reform which further centralises the rights of the child. </p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  </p><p>SNAs are recruited specifically to assist in the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context. The classroom teacher is responsible for educating all pupils in his/her class, including any pupil with a special educational need, and for the progress and care of all pupils.</p><p>When a pupil with significant and complex care needs has access to support from a SNA the classroom teacher will work closely with the SNA. However the class teacher continues to have primary responsibility for teaching and learning and for the social and emotional development and progress of the pupil. </p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289 million in 2021. </p>  <p>  In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures.</p>  <p>  Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p>  <p>  Already 124,000 tickets for the 2022/2023 school year have been issued to applicants for the new school year. To date, circa 20,400 additional places have been created for children for the 2022/2023 school year. </p>  <p>   Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to process applications and to issue tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service. However, regrettably the unprecedented numbers of new applications for the upcoming school year, has led to some delays in issuing tickets. </p>  <p>   Bus &Eacute;ireann is continuing to work through remaining applications and families will be contacted as further information is available.  </p>  <p>   The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p>  <p>  Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p> In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by 29 April and registered for a ticket by 29 July.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, will be considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.</p>  <p>  Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places, in these cases Bus &Eacute;ireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process.</p>  <p>It is very important for families to note that the application deadline for 2022/23 was 29 April 2022, and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is a &lsquo;late application&rsquo; and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.  Late applications will only be assessed after all &ldquo;on time&rdquo; applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants. &ldquo;</p></reply>

Supplementing these universal supports, the DEIS programme provides a targeted and equitable way to address concentrated educational disadvantage that promotes equity and has benefits for students.</p>  <p>  In this regard the DEIS programme targets the highest levels of resources at those schools that have been identified for DEIS Urban Band 1 status. Schools in this band are those that have been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  Schools in DEIS Urban band 1 receive a more beneficial staffing schedule allowing for the provision of smaller class sizes. They also receive priority access to the support of the National Educational Psychological Service, as well as access to the School Completion and School Meals programme. As with all urban schools, schools in this band receive home school community liaison support. Schools in Urban Band 1 receive a DEIS grant which reflects their high level of concentrated disadvantage.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. I recognise the need to target resources to those schools who need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders and will consider information provided by schools in correspondence to my Department.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on 3 April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023.  My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index when available can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household. </p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to the Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  To qualify for the Fuel Allowance, a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and satisfy all relevant qualifying conditions. </p>  <p>  The Job Initiative Scheme programme provided full-time employment for people 35 years of age or over, who had been unemployed for 5 years or more.  Since November 2004, there has been no recruitment to the Scheme.  Since January 2004, participants on the Job Initiative Scheme could no longer retain their entitlement to Fuel Allowance while participating on the scheme.  This decision was taken as the minimum rate of payment to participants on the scheme was significantly higher than the rate of qualifying Social Welfare payments.  </p>  <p>  The minimum rate of payment to a Job Initiative participant is still significantly higher than most Social Welfare primary payments, including payments such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker's Benefit, which are also non-qualifying payments for Fuel Allowance.  Participants on the Job Initiative Scheme are also considered to be in full time employment and not in receipt of a Social Welfare support payment. </p>  <p>  Any decision to allow Job Initiative Scheme participants to access the Fuel Allowance payment would have to be considered in the context of overall scheme policy and in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Those who are unemployed and in receipt of an eligible payment for 12 months or more may be eligible to participate on CE. </p>  <p>  In light of the Covid related challenges faced by CE schemes the Minister, Deputy Humphreys and I announced a number of reforms to CE since the start of 2022. As part of these reforms and to assist schemes with the transition from Covid emergency supports, participants including those with extended contracts, may not be required to leave CE, where a suitable replacement has not yet been referred to the scheme.  This is a transitionary provision for supporting schemes to retain services, with the higher-than-normal turnover of participants in 2022.  Extensions under this provision must be approved by officials from the Department and consideration will be given to the impact of COVID on the recruitment of participants, the type of service provided by the placement along with recruitment and referral efforts.  This does provide schemes with additional flexibility to retain participants, where required to maintain services in communities.

This method of processing applications supports a number of CWS areas across the country and it has been found to be very effective in releasing Community Welfare Officers (CWO) from the requirement to undertake administrative tasks and to focus on delivery of services. It allows for increased capacity for CWOs to meet with customers as required and to process claims. This model will be extended to cover all CWS areas across the country in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Technology plays a big part in how we can improve our citizens access to Community Welfare Services. It is expected that video call technology will be available shortly to allow customers to connect directly with a CWO.</p>  <p>  A freephone National Contact Phoneline for CWS was launched in June this year which further enhances access to the CWS nationwide. This is a dedicated phoneline available to people across the country to get information on the CWS and access to a CWO to seek assistance and support. Customers can contact the phoneline at 0818 60 70 80. Since the phoneline commenced operation, more and more people are availing of the opportunity to have their issues resolved by this method rather than by calling into an office. Arrangements are also in place for onward follow-up by a local CWO if an issue to this contact phoneline cannot be resolved.</p>  <p>  The Department is also assessing the provision of an online Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme application process. The provision of SWA1 forms online will ensure that those who wish to access this scheme without needing to attend an office can do so. </p>  <p>  Customers now no longer have to meet in person with a CWO to make a claim. This change ensures enhanced access to the Community Welfare Service. It means for instance that those who require community welfare assistance in a more remote rural area no longer have to wait for an outreach service to be available on a particular day. Intreo Centres and Branch Offices are open five days per week and any person who needs to access the Community Welfare Service can attend an office or can call the phone line to make an appointment for a consultation on the same day with a CWO.</p>  <p>  This is not intended to dilute or replace customers access to a CWO. Indeed the continued availability of locally based CWO is a cornerstone of the service. CWOs can facilitate emergency and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres across business hours, five days per week. Some CWOs are based in Social Welfare Branch Offices and provide appointments at those offices. In addition to meeting citizens in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home.</p>  <p>  It is vital that the Community Welfare Service is an easily accessible, flexible, and responsive service to meet the varied needs of vulnerable people, particularly in a time of crisis or emergency. While changes to modernise and improve the service for customers are a feature of the service, continued in-person customer engagement remains a pivotal feature within the community welfare service.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring. This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.</p>  <p>  A travel expenses disregard is included in the Carer's Allowance means test on an administrative basis. Where an allowance in regard to travel is already in place, such as a car allowance or the cycle to work scheme, the travel expenses disregard in the means test is not applied.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the crucial role that family carers play and is fully committed to supporting carers in that role. That is why I introduced significant improvements to the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, which were announced as part of Budget 2022 and came into effect in from June.</p>  <p>  The general weekly income disregard for Carer's Allowance was increased from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person, and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for a couple. This enabled more carers to become eligible for the scheme, and those currently in receipt of a reduced payment may now receive a higher payment.</p>  <p>  The capital disregard was also increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.  This allows carers who have accumulated savings, often to provide care for a loved one, to retain an entitlement to Carer's Allowance.</p>  <p>  In addition to these changes to the means test, all recipients of a weekly carers saw their payment increase by &euro;5 per week from the beginning of January. Those with children will also have benefitted from an increase in the qualified child payment - &euro;2 increase for children under the age of 12, and &euro;3 for children aged 12 and over - bringing these payments to &euro;40 and &euro;48 per week respectively.</p>  <p>  Any further changes to the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance would have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context. </p></reply>

The social insurance contribution requirements are not as high as for receipt of the State Pension, and people retiring at age 65, given they have a recent attachment to the workforce, should, in most cases meet the required PRSI conditionality. The scheme is not designed for those who took early retirement some 6 years ago in 2016.</p>  <p>  To be eligible for the payment a person must satisfy the qualifying conditions of the scheme including the PRSI social insurance contribution requirement.</p>  <p>  A person must have paid 104 PRSI insurable employment contributions at class A, H or P or paid 156 class S contributions if they are self-employed. The second contribution condition requires that a person must also have 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the Governing Contribution Year (GCY). The GCY for 2022 is 2020. At least 13 of these contributions must be paid. Where a person does not have 13 paid contributions in the GCY they can be from 2 years before the GCY, the last complete tax year or the current tax year. Alternatively, a person could qualify if they have at least 26 reckonable contributions paid in both the GCY and the year immediately preceding the GCY.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position.</p></reply>

I commenced the first parts of the Act on 1 July with the establishment of the Contact Preference Register and the launch of the Public Information Campaign. The Act provides that the Contact Preference Register must be open for a minimum period of three months before applications for birth information can be accepted. Accordingly, on the 12<sup>th</sup>September, I signed the Order which will commence information and tracing services from 3rd October.  </p><p>I have set out progress to date in implementing each of the seventeen recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection's Proposals for a State Response to Illegal Birth Registration in Ireland in tabular form below. <table>    <tr>       <th>Recommendation </th>       <th>Progress to date</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Recommendation #1: Every person has a legal right to have their identity (including their parentage   and their date and place of birth) accurately recorded. The Irish State is obliged to take measures to ensure that this occurs; to mitigate risks that   birth registrations may be falsified; and to investigate and remedy instances   of incorrect registration.</td>       <td>In recognition of every person&rsquo;s legal right to have their identity accurately recorded, the Government introduced significant amendments to the Civil Registration Act, through the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022.  These amendments ensure that robust legal powers exist for the General Registrar to obtain relevant information to support correction of the birth register.</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Recommendation #2: In   spite of having knowledge since the early 1950s of the possible existence of   a practice of illegal birth registrations, and having received an actual admission of the practice as early as 1992, the State failed until 2010 at the earliest to take sufficient steps to prevent the practice; to investigate its scale; or to remedy its effects. These failures exacerbated the impact of illegal birth   registration on the persons affected and amounted to a violation of the right   to identity under domestic and international law. It is incumbent on the State to take all practicable measures to remedy these violations without further   delay.</td>       <td>The Government has taken measures to remedy these matters through the Independent Review into Illegal Birth Registrations commissioned in 2018, the creation of the Interdepartmental Group in January 2021 to develop policy proposals to address issues arising for persons affected by illegal birth registration and the extensive new legislative measures set out in the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022.  These measures span issues of access to information, statutory tracing services, specialist tracing services, amendments to the Civil Registration Act to support accurate birth registration and legal acknowledgement of 'lived' identity, assurance on contracts entered into by affected persons and amendments to succession law. </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Recommendation #3: It is a   matter for persons affected by the practice of illegal birth registrations to   indicate whether they wish to receive a State apology. Should such an apology   be requested, it should be forthcoming. However, apologies carry little   weight unless backed by practical measures to remedy the rights violation in   question. As such, the State should implement measures aimed at the identification,   so far as possible, of cases of illegal birth registration; informing   individuals affected; and correcting the register of births.</td>       <td>The then Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar T.D., and the lead Minister, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman T.D., have delivered separate apologies on behalf of the Government, on the record of the Houses of the Oireachtas, to people affected by an   illegal birth registration. <br /><br /> <br /><br />In recognition of every person&rsquo;s legal right to have their identity   accurately recorded, the Government has introduced extensive new legislative measures via the Birth Information   and Tracing Act 2022 (see response above).</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Recommendation #4: In   implementing such measures, it is incumbent on the State to take steps aimed   at mitigating the trauma that may be experienced by individuals who are affected by illegal birth registration, and to avoid doing anything that   might add to that trauma.

The inquiry should adopt the truth commission model and be informed by principles of transitional justice (elaborated on in section 7 above). The scope, composition and working methods of the inquiry should be determined in consultation with persons affected by illegal adoptions, and consideration should be given to including such a person as a full member of the inquiry.</td>       <td>Government remains committed to delivering on the actions, as set out in the Government Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions, which respond to the priority needs and wishes of survivors, their families and advocates.  It has already made substantial progress on addressing the issues arising for people affected by adoption and illegal birth registration through the enactment of the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022 (Action 4).  Under the Action Plan, the Minister is also advancing work on an initiative for Recognition of the Voices and Lived Experiences of Survivors (Action 7.4). This would establish a process for survivors to come forward voluntarily and share the account of their lived experience, with a view to having it formally recognised for posterity as part of the official record.  This work fulfils one of the objectives of any truth commission, namely providing official recognition to the lived experience of people.  As a consequence of all this ongoing work, the Government will need to give further consideration to this specific recommendation.  <br /><br />The question of creating an effective non-statutory inquiry is a sensitive, complex and challenging one.    The Special Rapporteur acknowledges this and, in particular, notes the challenges associated with access to records for a non-statutory inquiry.  </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

I have directly engaged with survivors and advocacy groups since my appointment and will continue to engage with those most centrally involved with these matters.</p>  <p>  As I have acknowledged previously, plenary meetings of Collaborative Forum were unfortunately interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Having met in December 2019, it was necessary to put these meetings on hold in 2020 in the context of the public health restrictions as a number of members travel from outside the jurisdiction and some members are also in the at-risk groups identified by public health authorities.  </p>  <p>  Throughout 2020, members of the Forum were updated on relevant matters by the Forum Secretariat based in my Department. In 2021, there was engagement with the Forum via my Department in relation to an invitation to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability and Integration in relation to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of the then Institutional Burials Bill. I was pleased to see the Committee directly engage with members of the Collaborative Forum on this historic legislation.</p>  <p>  I held two virtual meetings with members of the Collaborative Forum in February 2021 to share developments in the State&rsquo;s response to the Commission&rsquo;s report and to engage on matters of concern to members. A proposed new structure to support wider stakeholder engagement was a specific agenda item. Further discussions on this issue were independently facilitated with Forum members during 2021, and feedback resulting from this process has assisted in refining proposals which I hope to bring to Government shortly. </p>  <p>  I also met with the Collaborative Forum on the 22nd of March this year to update members on the progress being made in advancing key initiatives in the published Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions. We discussed specific matters of concern to the Forum, including the significant legislative programme being progressed as part of the Action Plan and arrangements for publication of the Forum&rsquo;s report.</p>  <p>  Publication of the Forum&rsquo;s report had to initially await the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s report. For this reason, the Forum's recommendations were initially published and a commitment was given to revisit the question of publication following the completion of the Commission's work. Thereafter, acting on legal advice, the Department commenced a right of reply process to ensure relevant parties named in the report were afforded due process prior to publication. I can confirm that this necessary process has been concluded, thereby enabling my Department to seek further advices from the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office with a view to publication.</p>  <p>  I will contact the Collaborative Forum directly in advance of any arrangements being made for publication of the submitted report. </p></reply>

This included the concerns expressed directly to me by members of the Collaborative Forum in relation to the treatment of survivor testimony. Although care was taken in the design of the Confidential Committee component to try and allow the truth as survivors wanted it told to emerge, I recognise that this has not happened for many of them. I acknowledge the deep hurt which this has caused.</p>  <p>  I had previously indicated the possibility of a review of the testimony offered to the Confidential Committee. Having considered the matter, and recognising the independent analysis subsequently submitted to me by the Special Rapporteur as part of his annual report, I believe that a new initiative to support survivors in telling their personal account provides the best opportunity for responding to their call to be heard in their own words. In developing this initiative, I am mindful of the continuing influence of the legal framework provided by the Oireachtas to facilitate and direct the Commission&rsquo;s work, and the value of providing a new opportunity to survivors who may wish to share their lived experiences.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working on proposals for this new process. In developing this new initiative my officials are consulting with relevant legal and technical experts and, most importantly, will consult with survivors. Specific proposals will be brought to Government for approval this year.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the initiative will focus on respectful recording and acknowledgement of lived experiences rather than being inquisitorial in approach.  The scheme will be underpinned by statute and operate on a voluntary basis, with personal accounts received and utilised with the consent of participants. It will be overseen by a team with expertise in human rights, trauma and memory, communications and oral history. </p>  <p>  As this new approach will not be limited to those who participated in the Confidential Committee element of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation, it can provide a voluntary opportunity for all survivors who may wish to have their personal experience acknowledged as part of the national record. Those who previously recounted their experiences to the Confidential Committee will have the option of permitting the reuse of this testimony and/or offering new or additional oral or written testimony. </p>  <p>  These personal accounts or &ldquo;lived experiences&rdquo; will be housed in the National Centre for Research and Remembrance, which received Government approval on 29 March this year, and stand for posterity. While I have not spoken directly with the Collaborative Forum about the initial scoping work, I can assure the Deputy that survivors will be consulted in the course of developing this important initiative.</p></reply>

The Fifth Interim Report report noted that, despite extensive inquiries and searches, the Commission was only able to identify the burial places of 64 of children who died while resident in Bessborough. In the Final Report, the Commission further noted that it spent considerable time and resources to establish burials places of more than 1,400 children and infants who died in Bessborough Home and Sacred Heart Maternity Hospital or the Cork County Home and St Finnbarr's Hospital; however, it was only able to locate the burial places of 101 infants who died in one or other of these institutions. </p>  <p>  The Commission also concluded that it is likely that some of the children who died at Bessborough are buried in the grounds but was unable to find any physical or documentary evidence of this. The Commission carried out cartographic and landscape assessments of possible unrecorded burial arrangements and also followed up with people on responses to its appeal seeking information about burials in Bessborough. As no evidence of locations was found, the Commission did not consider it feasible to excavate the full available site, which amounts to 60 acres. </p>  <p>  The Institutional Burials Act 2022, which came into effect on 15th July last, provides the underlying legislative basis for an intervention, whereby the remains of those who died in residential institutions, and who were buried in a manifestly inappropriate manner, may be recovered and re-interred in a respectful and appropriate way.  The legislation was developed in response to the abhorrent situation at the site of the former Mother and Baby institution in Tuam, Co. Galway.  To avoid delays in responding to any similar situations that may arise in the future, the Act is not site specific and also allows for interventions at other institutional sites should manifestly inappropriate burials be discovered.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the distress felt by families regarding the death of relatives who were resident in the institution in Bessborough and the uncertainty regarding their burial places. However,  it is not open to the Government, and by extension to my Department, to procure or carry out investigations at the Bessborough site.</p>  <p>  I have emphasised that adequate consideration should be given to the findings of the Commission and the views of survivors and family members in the context of the proposed development of Bessborough site. Last year I made submissions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Cork City Council as part of the normal planning process, in respect of two planning applications made, requesting that due consideration be given to the sensitivity of the site and the conclusion of the Commission's reports. </p>  <p>  I will continue highlight the importance of appropriate treatment of sites associated with Mother and Baby homes and promote engagement with survivors, former residents and family members.</p></reply>

There are established complaints procedures for potential breaches of the Equal Status Acts. In June 2021, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman, T.D, announced his intention to conduct a review of the Equality Acts (comprising of the Equal Status Acts 2000-2018 and the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015). The review will be informed by a public consultation and it will examine the functioning of the Acts, including their effectiveness in combating discrimination and promoting equality, including in relation to disability.</p></reply>

This Action is being progressed through the Transport Working Group, which was established to implement the NDIS Action.</p>  <p>  The issue of transport supports for people with disabilities is a key priority for me as Minister of State with Responsibility for Disability. I chaired the most recent meeting of the Transport Working Group on 6 September 2022. At this meeting, the results of a scoping exercise of existing transport/mobility schemes for persons with disabilities was discussed. This discussion involved presentations from Government Departments on relevant schemes under their remit, and was conducted on foot of a stock taking exercise my Department conducted on existing schemes and provision across the state.</p>  <p>  With the scoping exercise completed, the current focus of the Group's work is on assessing the gaps and challenges in provision. A call for submissions on specific proposals from members of the Transport Working Group was launched on 16 September, with group members having been briefed on existing provision. This will inform the creation of a &lsquo;proposals paper&rsquo; on the provision of mobility and transport schemes, which will provide a basis and evidence base for further work and policy direction on the provision of coordinated supports.</p></reply>

The supply and demand data was drawn from a number of sources including extensive Higher Education Authority research and contacts with higher education institutions and a number of private organisations including developers, managers and providers of purpose build student accommodation. In this context the strategy references demand for a further 343 bed spaces in Waterford by 2024. </p>  <p>  The interim target of constructing 7,000 additional bed spaces by end 2019 as set out in Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness was exceeded, with 8,300 bed spaces constructed in that period. The final National Student Accommodation Strategy target is the construction of at least an additional 21,000 bed spaces by 2024 and in relation to achieving that target my Department has been advised that at the end of 2021 an additional 12,149 bed spaces had been constructed with a further 3,128 on site and plans approved for an additional 10,493.</p>  <p>  However, the strategy recognises that the demand for purpose built student accommodation (PBSA) currently outstrips supply and this trend will continue to 2024. </p>  <p>  In the current wider very challenging housing environment and given the considerably increased costs of construction, the scarcity of PBSA provision and housing generally and the knock-on pressures on students trying to secure affordable accommodation, I have asked my officials to concentrate not on revising the current strategy but rather on radically altering the current model which is predicated primarily on the supply of PBSA from the private sector. </p>  <p>  In this context I secured Government approval in July to advance an innovative policy that for the first time will see the State assist with the cost of building student accommodation beds in return for affordable rents for students. Detailed work is currently being advanced with a section dedicated to student accommodation having been established in the Department. Meetings will now take place with representative bodies and stakeholders as well as individual Higher Education Institutes with a view to developing pathways to accommodation and accelerating their delivery.  </p></reply>

In this context it is now anticipated that any borrowing framework for TUs would in the first instance prioritise the provision of PBSA in line with commitments in the Government's Housing for All plan. </p>  <p>  In December 2021 the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage confirmed that his Department had reviewed the Housing Finance Agency Act 1981 (as amended) and was satisfied that the legislation in place was robust enough to allow the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) to also lend, in addition to universities designated under the Universities Act 1997, to TUs, Institutes of Technology and other institutions encompassed by the definition of &ldquo;Institutes of Higher Education&rdquo; in the Higher Education Authority Act 1971 where such borrowing is in respect of the provision of housing accommodation for students. </p>  <p>  This provision is being further strengthened under Section 130 of the Higher Education Authority Bill (as amended) currently advancing through the legislative process in the Houses of the Oireachtas by copper-fastening and broadening the type of institution to which the HFA can lend to with relevant consents including other education institutions not designated under the remit of the HEA but who are in receipt of core funding through the public system.</p>  <p>  Institutions, other than traditional universities, would firstly require my consent to borrow following consultation with the Higher Education Authority. This will necessitate the establishment of an appropriate framework setting out the criteria, financial and non-financial, including governance, oversight and reporting to define the operational process through which such consent would be sought and obtained.  Having passed those primary screening tests the prospective borrowing entity would then be required to pass the relevant tests, procedures and requirements of the HFA before accessing borrowing funds.</p>  <p>  My Department is ready to work with any or all of the five TUs to support them to borrow to build PBSA. The impacts, risks and responsibilities arising from such borrowing are key considerations in this context. In addition to accessing borrowing on commercially viable and appropriate terms such as would not adversely impact the financial position of TUs themselves or the wider public finances, as stated requisite oversight, risk evaluation, project management and attendant governance and regulatory processes would also need to be established.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that there will, as appropriate, be robust and adequate systems in place to ensure any proposed borrowing is rigorously examined to protect both Exchequer funding and HEIs themselves.</p></reply>

The once off and repayable funding was provided in 2019 to ensure immediate stability of the college and predicated on the completion of the financial sustainability plan for the college.  The provision of emergency funding was essential to maintain current services at the Institute.</p>  <p>  In April 2020 the HEA approved the Institute&rsquo;s sustainability plan prepared with the assistance of Deloitte consultants and submitted it to the Department for consideration and progression. The plan includes actions to reduce the cost base and increase income including from additional apprenticeship blocks, increasing student numbers and lifelong learning course uptake. </p>  <p>  The Institute merged with Cork Institute of Technology (CIT) to form Munster Technological University (MTU) from 1st January 2021.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued provision of higher education in Tralee. In that context there is no question that the actions to secure a resolution to IT Tralee&rsquo;s/MTU Kerry&rsquo;s financial difficulties would be expected to give rise to creation of a potential burden which would undermine the financial stability and sustainability of MTU. </p>  <p>  Given the position and development of MTU this funding has not been scheduled for repayment to date, however this is under regular review by the HEA and my Department.</p></reply>

This was made effective from 1 January 2021 and, together with an increase to funding for postdoctoral salaries, benefited close to 1,300 early-career researchers in the system.

Under the terms of the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p>  <p>  The student grant scheme opens the door for many people to access further and higher education who would not otherwise have been able to avail of these opportunities. The scheme is demand led and as such the numbers applying each year can change for reasons such as demographics, employment rates etc.    </p>  <p>  City of Dublin ETB, by way of order under the Student Support Act 2011, was designated as the appointed awarding authority for student grants on 22nd May 2012. To deliver this statutory function, CDETB set up a business unit called SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland). Provision is made for the pay and non-pay costs associated with SUSI.  The estimated annual SUSI administration cost for 2022 is circa &euro;10.5m million out of a total allocation in 2022 of circa &euro;423 million for student supports and related activities.</p></reply>

In this regard students who have previously pursued a course of third level study which has attracted exchequer funding (e.g. fees, maintenance, tax relief, subsidy towards course cost) and have not secured a qualification and subsequently resume third level studies within 5 years are not eligible for free fees for the equivalent period of time spent on the first course.</p><p>However, once an equivalent period of study has been completed on the new course, the student may become eligible for free fees funding for the remainder of the course where they meet all other criteria of the free fees scheme.</p><p>Subject to compliance with the other conditions of the Free Fees initiative, tuition fees may be paid in respect of eligible students who, having attended but not completed approved courses, are returning following a break of at least five years in order to pursue approved courses at the same level. Based on the details provided a student that attended for one year in 2016/2017 and was eligible for free fees at that time may be eligible for free fees in 2022/23 due to a break of 5 academic years.</p><p>Further information on the criteria of the FFI is available on the studentfinance.ie website at the following location: <i>hea.ie/funding-governance-performance/funding/student-finance/course-fees/</i>.</p><p>The assessment of eligibility under the Free Fees Initiative (FFI) in individual cases is a matter for each higher education institution to determine within the terms of the scheme, exceptions to the criteria cannot be made in individual cases by the Department.</p><p>Where a student requires guidance on how the FFI criteria may apply to their individual circumstances and their application to an institution I recommend students makes direct contact with the fees office of the relevant institution.</p></reply>

The Guidelines rightly state that no one should have to suffer domestic violence and recognise that migrants may have additional vulnerability in this area, as the perpetrator may threaten a victim with the loss of their status if they report the abuse.  </p><p>I would urge anyone in this situation to approach my Department for advice and assistance and I can assure any victim of abuse that they will be supported and protected.  Anyone who is the victim of domestic abuse and whose permission to be in the State is linked to their partner, will have the issue of their status dealt with sensitively by the immigration authorities and each case will be assessed on an individual basis.</p><p>I would also encourage anyone who has been a victim of domestic violence to reach out for help as soon as it is safe to do so. The Still Here Campaign website, has a full list of support services that are available to victims of domestic violence.</p><p>Female victims can contact the Women&rsquo;s Aid Freephone Helpline on 1800 341 900.

Further information on that service can be found at: </p><p>https://www.womensaid.ie/services/helpline/telephoneinterp.html. </p><p>Male victims of domestic violence can contact the male domestic violence advice line on 1800 816 588.</p><p>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, I recently published, &lsquo;Zero Tolerance - The Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence&rsquo; (DSGBV).The Strategy is ambitious and far-reaching and has been developed with those working in the sector, and on the frontline with victims, to ensure it is informed by lived experience. The goal of the Strategy is clear: zero tolerance in Irish society for any form of domestic violence.

The national car and van (LGV) fleet accounts for almost 60% of all land transport emissions, and so a transition to low emissions vehicles, including EVs, is a necessary step change to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions.</p><p>My Department recently replaced its 15 year old diesel van with a new electric van procured under the Office of Government Procurement framework.</p><p>I have requested the information sought by the Deputy from the agencies and bodies under my Department&rsquo;s remit and this is provided below. </p><p>The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) has a fleet of 42 cars ranging in years from 2012 to 2022.  Since 2019 the Bureau has replaced a number of its older cars with hybrid models and currently has 3 hybrid cars in its fleet. It is the intention of the Bureau to continue to replace existing petrol and diesel cars with electric /hybrid models where possible, taking into consideration logistical practicalities and the unique nature of duties undertaken by the Bureau.</p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) recently placed an order for two mild hybrid vehicles to replace some of its existing fleet. Over the next few years GSOC will consider the option of replacing more of its fleet with either fully electric or hybrid vehicles.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service (IPS) is engaged in a pilot assessment of vehicles in a number of locations to assess the feasibility and suitability of electric vehicles and it is hoped and expected that these will replace 2017 diesel engine cars. </p><p>The IPS intend to have 10 battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in its fleet by the end of 2022 representing 6.6% of the suitable fleet with further investment in 2023 and 2024. </p><p>While the pilot will focus on passenger fleet vehicles and light commercials, the IPS continues to research market capabilities to support electric vehicle use for secure cellular transport of Court and inter-prison transfers.  The suitable use of electric vehicles for such purposes is currently unproven, but the Irish Prison Serviced continues to monitor vehicle development and design with further expansion in mind.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has purchased a small number of hybrid vehicles as part of ongoing consideration around the feasibility of including a larger number of hybrid and fully electric vehicles within the Government fleet.  Of the 17 cars currently in the Government fleet, two are plug-in electric and one is hybrid. A further allocation of one fully electric vehicle is planned for the near future.</p><p>There are currently 3,290 vehicles on the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Fleet, of which 168 vehicles or 5% are electric or hybrid.  See breakdown below: <table>    <tr>       <th>As at 14th September 2022</th>       <th>Number of vehicles</th>       <th>% of vehicles</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Electric </td>       <td>37 </td>       <td>1.1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Plug In Electric Hybrid</td>       <td>8 </td>       <td>0.2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Hybrid Unleaded</td>       <td>31 </td>       <td>0.9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mild Hybrid Diesel</td>       <td>92 </td>       <td>2.8 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>168 </td>       <td>5 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Fleet Management plans to roll out electric vehicles (EVs) in conjunction with the required charging infrastructure and are currently liaising with Estate Management to identify Garda Stations that have the electrical supply capacity for the installation of EV charging points. When suitable locations have been identified, Fleet Management will consult with the OPW to prioritise EV charging point installation.</p><p>A further seven EVs and 18 hybrid unleaded vehicles are on order with expected delivery in Q4 2022.  </p><p>The purchase and allocation of vehicles is made on the basis of identified operational demands and the availability of resources and is reviewed on a continual basis.</p></reply>

The concept of "Maintenance" is where a party without an interest in an action funds the litigation of another. The concept of "Champerty" is where a party without an interest in an action funds the litigation of another but also with a view to sharing the profits of the action.</p>  <p>  Aspects of litigation funding are also considered to be contrary to public policy. In particular, litigation funding may drive a market in legal claims and promote litigation for the benefit of the promoter rather than the litigant. This, in turn, may create a substantial injustice to a defendant in an action. The cost of litigation and its impact on access to justice has, however, been a matter of concern for some time.</p>  <p>  Chapter 9 of the Review of the Administration of Civil Justice (Kelly) Report recommends a policy review of third-party funding of litigation costs. Implementation of the review's recommendations will take place on a phased basis over a number of years. I am advised that the Law Reform Commission, arising from its June 2016 Issues Paper on "Contempt of Court and Other Offences and Torts Involving the Administration of Justice", is working on a discussion paper on the matter, which will be available in the coming months. The outcome of that consultation process will be considered as part of a policy review and proposals developed if required.</p>  <p>  As an interim step however, I am considering recommending to Government that third party funding be permitted in a limited way, specifically in relation to commercial arbitration. This should assist the broader Government policy of promoting Ireland as a destination of choice for international commercial legal business under the Ireland for Law initiative.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is working on a draft Bill to transpose EU Directive 2020/1828 into Irish Law. The General Scheme of the Representative Actions for the Protection of the Collective Interests of Consumers Bill 2022 was published earlier this year. Part 2 of the Bill will prescribe the manner in which representative actions are brought before the High Court and will transpose Article 10 of the Directive, which relates to the matter of third-party funding of litigation. The Directive does not impose any requirements on Member States to make changes to domestic law regarding third-party funding for litigation. The Bill will require the High Court judge hearing the case to undertake a mandatory assessment of compliance of the qualified entity with the law in Ireland regarding third-party funding "in so far as allowed" when the representative action is brought. Subject to Government approval, it is expected that the Bill will be published later this year.</p></reply>

In 2019, additional funding of &euro;240,000 for Drug and Alcohol Taskforces was announced. Each of the 24 Drug and Alcohol Task Forces received &euro;10,000 on a recurring basis.</p>  <p>  The Department completed a mid-term review of the actions in the National Drugs Strategy, Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery, a health-led response to drugs and alcohol use. Based on the learning from the mid-term review, six strategic priorities for 2021-2025 were identified.</p>  <p>  One such priority is to enhance access to and delivery of drug and alcohol services in the community. This priority seeks to enhance community care for people who use drugs by providing health and social care services at the community level to meet identified health needs.</p>  <p>  This will be supported though the development of a drug services care plan formulated on the basis of the new six health regions agreed by Government in 2019. Particular focus will be put on ensuring access to services for women, people in rural areas, ethnic minorities and the LGBTI+ community. This priority will consider models of care for people who use drugs and have co-morbidities. It will also address the stigma linked to drug use and drug addiction and its impact on access and delivery of health services.</p>  <p>  In December 2021, I announced a new &euro;2 million fund to enhance community-based drug and alcohol services - the Community Services Enhancement Fund (CSEF). The fund supports the aforementioned strategic priority under the national drugs strategy for 2021-2025.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the additional challenges faced by services because of inflation. The additional operating costs for community-based drug and alcohol services, along with other HSE funded section 39 services, will be considered as part of the 2023 Estimates process.</p></reply>

It is expected that once a contract is in place, information will be published shortly thereafter to facilitate applications and payment. Once this process is in place, the Department is keen that payments to eligible workers will be made as soon as possible thereafter.</p><p>With regard to eligible staff in cohorts 5 and 6, the Department of Health is engaging with the Department of Defence, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to progress payments to these cohorts as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Currently there are 2,522 GPs contracted to provide services under the GMS Scheme. Where a GP GMS vacancy is set to arise in a practice, the HSE is notified in advance and becomes actively involved in the recruitment process to find a replacement GP. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement, the Government is increasing annual investment in general practice by approximately 40% (&euro;210 million) between 2019 and 2023. The Agreement provides for an increase in capitation fees for GPs, additional services, improved family arrangements as well as a targeted &euro;2 million fund to support to practices in deprived urban areas. </p>  <p>  A steady increase has been seen in the number of doctors entering GP training over recent years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 258 in 2022. The transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) which was concluded in 2021 will allow for the introduction of a new service model for GP training in Ireland and the further expansion GP training capacity in the years ahead. The ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.</p>  <p>  These measures will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p>  <p>  With regard to the allocation of a general practitioners to the Ballyboden Primary Care Centre, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on this issue, as soon as possible. I have also asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with an update on GMS GP vacancies in Dublin South West.</p></reply>

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has developed and is implementing an interim Model of Care to provide Long COVID services nationally with 2.2 million euro allocated this year. Funding for next year is currently under consideration. This Model of Care involves services across a number of healthcare settings including GPs, community services and acute hospitals. The first priority is to ensure there are Long COVID and Post-Acute COVID clinics operating within each Hospital Group to ensure a national service.</p>  <p>  The Long-Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. The LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. It is not possible at this juncture to say what the outcome of this review will be.</p>  <p>  For individuals who are not covered by the LTI scheme there are other schemes that may assist with their medical expenses.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

The public health advice does not include a scheme such as the one referred to by the Deputy so no estimate of the likely cost of such a scheme is available. </p><p>From the autumn, the HSE will be adopting a more targeted approach for COVID-19 testing which will be based on a clinical assessment where a clinician requires the result to contribute to the diagnosis and management of an individual patient, or where deemed necessary by Public Health in relation to the management of an outbreak or specific public health risk. It also means that we can target treatment interventions where they will be of benefit. The approach to COVID-19 testing is facilitated by the high level of vaccine-induced and naturally acquired population immunity in Ireland. This is mitigating against the worst impacts of infection. </p><p>The HSE is also enhancing existing infectious disease surveillance systems so that we can ensure effective monitoring and signalling of what is happening with the virus at population level, and so that we can understand disease transmission and severity along with population immunity and risk.</p><p>The pandemic is not over and COVID-19 is still a concern so testing remains an important part of our ongoing response to the disease for individuals vulnerable to its effects and for whom testing is indicated. For everybody, continuing to follow our public health advice available on hse.ie is still important. Anybody who has symptoms of COVID-19 should self-isolate until 48 hours after the symptoms are mostly or fully gone. </p><p>Anybody who has concerns about an underlying condition or their level of risk in relation to COVID-19 is advised to seek advice from their GP or treating clinician.</p><p>My Department, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL), overseen by the interim Chief Medical Officer, continue to review the COVID-19 epidemiological situation in Ireland and internationally.

Ireland has committed to donate up to 5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and over 2.1 million doses have already been delivered, mainly through the COVAX global vaccine initiative. The COVAX facility is a collaborative initiative, established to accelerate worldwide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and is the most effective mechanism to distribute vaccines quickly and fairly to those who need them most. Arrangements are currently in place for the delivery of a further 1.9 million doses through COVAX (est. delivery September/October). Ireland has also committed &euro;13.5m in financing to the COVAX facility to facilitate the purchase of vaccines by low and lower middle-income countries and to cover the transport and insurance costs associated with donations. </p><p>The below table sets out the vaccine doses delivered through COVAX to date with the exception of Uganda where the donation was on a bilateral basis. <table>    <tr>       <th>Recipient Country</th>       <th>Doses allocated</th>       <th>Manufacturer</th>       <th>Delivery date</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Uganda (Bilateral)</td>       <td>335,500</td>       <td>AstraZeneca</td>       <td>Oct 2021</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nigeria</td>       <td>496,800</td>       <td>Janssen</td>       <td>Nov 2021</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Indonesia</td>       <td>403,200</td>       <td>AstraZeneca</td>       <td>112,800 and 122,800 in Dec 2021 and 168,000 in Jan 2022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ghana</td>       <td>276,000</td>       <td>AstraZeneca</td>       <td>Dec 2021</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Burkina Faso</td>       <td>376,800</td>       <td>Janssen</td>       <td>Jan 2022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sudan</td>       <td>165,600</td>       <td>Janssen</td>       <td>Jun 2022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Djibouti</td>       <td>93,600</td>       <td>Janssen</td>       <td>Sep 2022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mexico</td>       <td>312,000</td>       <td>Pfizer</td>       <td>Expected Sep 2022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sudan</td>       <td>1,591,200</td>       <td>Janssen</td>       <td>Pending</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It has been requested that donations to COVAX meet certain minimum standards including a recommendation for a minimum of 10 weeks shelf life when donated vaccine doses arrive in-country. Officials in my Department engage extensively with relevant stakeholders to ensure donated vaccines distributed through COVAX have adequate shelf life to meet recipient country requirements.</p><p>The COVAX donation process follows several complex steps and coordination across multiple stakeholders. The vaccine donation landscape has become increasingly complex with many developing countries experiencing significant absorption, administration and hesitancy challenges that prevent matching available supply with need.</p></reply>

The number of registered pharmacists on the Register of Pharmacists held and maintained by the PSI has continued to grow steadily, with an average increase of 187 registrants each year over the past five years. As at 4 May 2022, 6848 pharmacists are currently registered with the PSI, under established processes based in Irish and EU law.</p>  <p>  I understand that currently there are reports of a current workforce issue, particularly in relation to community pharmacy. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) has been liaising with stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address the issue. In February 2022, PSI met with a number of superintendent pharmacists and the IPU. The PSI also circulated a survey on behalf of the IPU to all registrants to support efforts to understand and address the issue in the short term. The fieldwork on the research was undertaken online by the IPU between 22 March and 8 April 2022. The results of which have just been finalised and recommendations have been prepared by the IPU based on their findings.  The report is currently under review by the Department of Health who will continue to liaise with relevant stakeholders on this matter. </p>  <p>   In developing its Corporate Strategy 2021-2023, the PSI was aware, through its role as the pharmacy regulator as well as through reports from stakeholders, of an increasing risk to the continued availability of a pharmacist workforce. This highlighted a need to focus on community and hospital pharmacy, with a concern being that the issue might be exacerbated into the future. The PSI are currently undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23,  titled &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;. This project is set to &ldquo;assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The European Commission is also currently supporting a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan, a health and social care workforce planning model, health and social care workforce projections and gap analysis project. Support includes recommendations for health and social care workforce reforms. </p>  <p>  This is a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders. Workforce challenges are being experienced in other sectors nationally, and in the community pharmacy sector in a range of other countries. However, robust data for Ireland is needed to be able to determine the current landscape, assess future health system needs and understand existing sectoral challenges now and into the future.  It will be on the basis of gathering and analysing this up-to-date, robust and relevant data, that recommendations can be proposed to address Ireland&rsquo;s needs as our healthcare system evolves, and in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.    </p>  <p>I supported the inclusion of pharmacists on the critical skills occupations list and that Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, Damien English TD, announced on the 20th   June of this year changes made by Statutory Instrument to the employment permits system which includes adding the occupation of Pharmacist to the Critical Skills Occupations List.  This means that Pharmacists are now eligible for a Critical Skills Employment Permit.</p></reply>

This measure will be ring fenced to staff working ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments.  </p><p>Information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/Section 38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in: </p><p>1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.); </p><p>2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities; </p><p>3. Agency roles working in the HSE; </p><p>4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE; </p><p>5. Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE;  </p><p>6. Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE.  </p><p>The above 6 areas only are covered by this Government Decision and all eligible workers will be paid in accordance with the overarching eligibility criteria in place.  Once this process is published, the Department is keen that payments to eligible workers will be made as soon as possible thereafter.</p><p>As the rollout of payments to the eligible workers in non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisations has not yet begun, and eligibility has not yet been assessed across the private sector, I cannot provide an estimated number of workers who will receive the payment. We expect the rollout to begin shortly and for eligible workers to be paid as soon as possible. </p><p>Rolling out the payment to eligible employees of those specific non-HSE/Section 38 organisations covered by the government decision is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered, but this work is being given priority attention. </p><p>I want to reassure you that the Government is prioritising this payment and remains extremely appreciative for all our healthcare workers&rsquo; efforts in the fight against Covid-19.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.</p>  <p>  Under the LTI scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. Gestational diabetes is not a permanent or long-term illness and is, therefore, not covered by the LTI scheme.  The LTI scheme will be included as part of a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. </p>  <p>  There Drug Payment Scheme (DPS) and the General Medical Services Scheme (GMS) scheme offers supports for access to medical approved items that may assist patients with gestational diabetes.</p>  <p>  Under the DPS, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card under the GMS scheme. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.</p>  <p>  Patients may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

The TAS enables a public healthcare consultant to refer a patient to the public health service in the EU, UK or Switzerland for treatment not available in Ireland. Once the criteria are met, the HSE is obliged to fund the care. A NHS-commissioned review of the clinic has recommended closure and a move to a local/regional approach to service provision, in line with other paediatric services.</p>  <p>  The HSE is reviewing the NHS report and assessing the potential impact for existing pathways of care and service delivery. The HSE national clinical advisory and group lead for mental health meets regularly with Tavistock Clinic to discuss waiting list issues. The HSE has not received any complaints about the services provided by the clinic. The HSE is actively seeking services in other countries to replace the Tavistock Clinic.</p>  <p>  The Department received a report on the Cass report from the Office of the National Clinical Director and Lead for Integrated Care in the HSE, which is currently being considered. </p>  <p>  The report of the steering committee on the development of HSE transgender services was published in 2020. The report acknowledged the additional funding made available to develop services in recent years. It advised on the development of seamless interfaces between agencies providing gender services and developed a job description for a consultant psychiatrist in child and adolescent psychiatry to lead on the development of a services for those aged under 18 years.  Subsequently, this position was advertised twice but has not yet been filled. </p>  <p>  Minister Donnelly and Minister Butler recently held a constructive meeting with a number of clinicians from the National Gender Service. They intend to meet with the HSE and other stakeholders to hear their views and proposals.</p>  <p>  Minister Donnelly, Minister Butler and I are committed to working with the HSE to provide a gender identify service that meets the health needs of children and young people.</p></reply>

As of Friday, 9 September, 85,078 eligible HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes Section 38 agencies which are estimated to have paid 37,589  staff to date thereby bringing the total number of employees paid to 122,667.</p><p>The HSE and the Department have been examining progressing the rollout of the Pandemic Recognition Payment to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. This measure will be ring fenced to staff working ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5. Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; </p><p>6. Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE. </p><p>In relation to eligible staff in cohorts 1-4 above, in order to progress the payment of the Pandemic Recognition Payment, the HSE has published an invitation to tender for a third-party contractor to assist with the payment process. The invitation to tender remained open for potential tenderers to apply for the contract until the 9<sup>th</sup>of September 2022. It is expected that once a contract is in place, information will be published shortly thereafter to facilitate applications and payment. Once this process is in place, the Department is keen that payments to eligible workers will be made as soon as possible thereafter.</p><p>With regard to eligible staff in cohorts 5 and 6, the Department of Health is engaging with the Department of Defence, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to progress payments to these cohorts as soon as possible.</p></reply>

However, the support of public health and ICT was required and, due to COVID-19 pandemic, this work could not be continued and funding was returned.</p>  <p>  The development of a national diabetes registry remains a priority. Following substantial increases in investment in eHealth, the national diabetes registry is now being considered as part of a wider review of Ireland&rsquo;s health information strategy and will operate as a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; registry.</p>  <p>  Government approval was given in April to prepare the General Scheme of a Health Information Bill. It is envisaged that the Bill will include a provision to enable the operation of disease-specific &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; registries, including a virtual national diabetes registry, where information on disease diagnoses and treatment from healthcare providers is efficiently collated, combined and quality-checked from administrative records to create a database akin to an active registry for each disease. This will greatly improve the potential to monitor rare-disease prevalence in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme is currently being prepared for submission to Government in Q4 2022.</p></reply>

Each application within a CHO is assessed by the local Resource Allocation Group and a determination is made regarding approval based on clinical priority and the funding availability within local budgets.</p>  <p>  Currently, many of these aids and appliances are not provided on a standardised basis across the country and many do not yet have formal contracts in place governing their supply or price. This has resulted in an inequality of access for some aids and appliances in some areas. In addition, it does not allow the HSE to deliver best value for money in the provision of these aids and appliances.</p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Improvement Programme has the aim of improving the equity of access, value for money, and functional processes of the Community Funded Schemes through the establishment of national standards and guidelines for the provision of medical and surgical aids and appliances.</p>  <p>  The scale of this Programme is enormous given that many thousands of items are provided from community-based services across the country.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-20a.1480.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092000082#WRZ06000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 572 to 574, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The remit of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS) is to provide a safe, reliable and robust blood service to the Irish health system.  A major objective of the IBTS is to ensure that it always has the necessary programmes and procedures in place to protect both the recipients and the donors of blood and blood products.  The IBTS constantly keeps all deferral policies under active review, in the light of scientific evidence, emerging infections and international evidence, to ensure the ongoing safety of blood and the products derived from it.</p>  <p>  The IBTS established an independent &lsquo;Advisory Committee for Social Behaviours Review&rsquo; to review the evidence base for donor selection, deferral and exclusion in Ireland in relation to social behaviours that may increase the risk of acquiring specific blood-borne infections.</p>  <p>  In relation to the implementation of the Social Behaviour Review Group's recommendations, the IBTS determined that oral sex between gay and bisexual Men who have Sex with Men (gbMSM) would be one of a number of sexual behaviours which would be considered in the comprehensive risk assessment undertaken as part of the implementation process. This mirrors the approach previously taken by the UK Blood Services with the introduction of the FAIR system of individual assessment.</p>  <p>  The deferral period in Ireland is four months as that is the deferral period used in the EU Blood Directive. For some deferrals the Directive does state three months, and this will be evaluated once the extensive revision of the EU Directive, currently in progress, is completed and the updated Directive implemented.</p>  <p>  With regard to the electronic questionnaire, due to complexity of the modifications required to existing blood systems, the implementation of the electronic health questionnaire has been delayed until the end of Q1 2023. The IBTS will however be implementing a safe paper-based version of the individualised donor risk assessment by the end of the 2022. Again, this is similar to the approach taken by the UK blood services.</p></reply>

There are minimum standards that farmers must meet under Conditionality, which is part of the legislative requirements and minimum standards of the new CAP.</p>  <p>  Conditionality includes the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) standards. One of them, known as GAEC 2,  deals with  the protection of carbon rich soils, and this requires protection of wetland and peatland to be implemented within each Member State.  Ireland has indicated  that this standard will apply from 2024.</p>  <p>  Large quantities of carbon are stored in peatlands and wetlands, and certain agricultural practices (e.g. ploughing) may have a negative impact on such soils with regard to carbon storage. The minimum standards established for management under this GAEC will be aimed at minimising carbon loss from such soils. </p>  <p>  Production of high-quality grass is without doubt an integral part of Irish agriculture and reseeding has a role to play in that.  However, it is important to note that while protection of carbon rich soils may  include restrictions on ploughing, it does not preclude less invasive methods of reseeding being carried out.</p>  <p>  Ireland is now working in conjunction with the technical experts in the European Commission&rsquo;s Joint Research Centre to identify the relevant lands. </p>  <p>  At this point no final decision has been taken on what the appropriate minimum standards will be.

I Like any non-licensed activities it is important that it is done in such a way that it does not interfere with the licence conditions being met.

It is recognised by the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI), the Irish Sports Council, the Olympic Council of Ireland and Sport Northern Ireland. It was established in 2007 when the Equestrian Federation of Ireland and the Irish Horse Board were amalgamated, bringing together the breeding and competition sectors, on the basis of a Government commissioned report on the sector at the time. It receives State funds from the Department and through Sport Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is responsible for devising and implementing strategies for the development and promotion of an internationally competitive Irish sport horse industry (breeding, sport and leisure aspects). HSI is approved by DAFM to maintain the Irish Sport Horse, Irish Draught Horse, Irish Sport Pony and Irish Cob Studbooks and it operates a comprehensive breed improvement programme and undertakes promotional and marketing initiatives.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to maximising the potential of the Sport Horse industry and continues to provide support to it financially and with policy initiatives. I have demonstrated my commitment to the industry by increasing the budget allocated to Horse Sport Ireland from &euro;2.5m in 2018 to &euro;5.2m in 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to assisting in the promotion and development of equine breeding and production systems in Ireland. This is achieved through working closely with HSI. </p>  <p>  I have recently received a copy of the funding submission from HSI for 2023, which, inter alia, details matters raised by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  The HSI also receive funding through the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p></reply>

It is suggested that the current restriction of operations period should be extended from March 1st to August 15th.&rdquo;</p><p>Dr Fieldings report states that his &ldquo;comments should be interpreted as applying specifically to the appeals considered&rdquo;.</p><p>While my Department immediately accepted the appeal result and implemented the FAC decision for these cases, clarification was sought as to whether a change in procedures more generally should apply.  Advise was sought from the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage (DCHLG) on the matter.  Experts there were forwarded Dr Fieldings report and findings and asked if the change to March 1<sup>st</sup>restriction should apply more generally to all sites following the FAC decision.</p><p>In their response DCHLG stated that  &ldquo;As the stated range (as per Huxley et al 2013) for the period of site occupation and display is late February to late May, NPWS supports Dr Fielding&rsquo;s position about the potentiality of disturbance impacting on Hen Harrier individuals immediately before or during the breeding season and, by extension, potentially impacting on the Hen Harrier SPAs&rsquo; breeding populations.  Without a full review of all relevant data that has been collected in Ireland in recent years, it is challenging, particularly in isolation of examining other associated factors relevant to the Red Area procedure (and indeed its implementation on the ground), to define a precise cut-off date where the risk of significant impact on the sites&rsquo; breeding populations begins.&rdquo;</p><p>Despite the absence of a recommendation from the DHLGH around a precise date but taking into account the well-considered assessment by DCHLGH of Dr fieldings report, DAFM decided that all relevant licences, that would normally have been subject to a Hen Harrier timing restriction starting 1<sup>st</sup>April will from FAC decision date forward have the restriction starting 1<sup>st</sup>March.</p><p>I will use my powers under the Forestry Act to amend any relevant licence that has issued since the date of the FAC decision that has not already been varied.  I will not be revisiting all licences that predate the FAC decision.</p></reply>

This year's programme has a total budget of &euro;7 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;1.5 million on the budget for the 2021 CL&Aacute;R programme. </p><p>Under Measure 1, Community Facilities &amp;amp; Amenities applications were accepted directly from Local Authorities.  Meals-on-wheels community groups could apply for capital funding under this Measure.  The 2022 Programme is now closed and details of successful applications are published on my Department's website. Funding of over &euro;10 million was approved under Measure 1.</p><p><b>- Social Enterprise: </b>Many community organisations and meals-on-wheels providers are social enterprises, and may apply for any scheme run by DRCD under the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF) Social Enterprise Measure.</p><p>Past DAF schemes include Small capital grants schemes, Training and Mentoring Schemes, Schemes for start-up social enterprises, the Awareness Raising Initiative of Social Enterprise (ARISE) Scheme, and the Scaling-up Scheme for Social Enterprise.  There are currently no DAF schemes accepting applications under the measure, details of any forthcoming schemes will published on the DRCD website.</p><p><b>- The Community Services Programme</b>(CSP). The programme supports over 2,000 positions in more than 430 community organisations to provide a vast range of local services through a social enterprise model.  The CSP supports a range of services and activities that enhance the quality of life of older people and those most vulnerable within our communities, including the provision of meals within centres and via a meals-on-wheels service.</p><p>CSP funding is provided as a fixed annual contribution of &euro;19,033 for each fulltime equivalent (FTE) position being supported, and, where warranted, provides &euro;32,000 towards the cost of employing a manager, focusing on communities where public and private sector services are lacking, either through geographical or social isolation or because demand levels are not sufficient.  Qualifying organisations must be social enterprises capable of generating income from their activities in order to meet the full salary costs of the supported posts, for example, from income received from the public use of facilities and services. </p><p>Following an independent review of the CSP, the programme is currently being redesigned.  Pending the transition to the new restructured programme, the scheme is closed to new applications through the Expression of Interest process.  It is anticipated that the programme may open calls to address identified gaps in service delivery later in 2022, and any additional entrants will be considered in light of available budgets.</p><p><b>- Community Activities Fund (CAF):</b>The CAF supports community and voluntary groups impacted by COVID-19.  This Fund helped community groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with their running costs such as utility or insurance bills, as well as with improvements to their facilities.  The CAF is currently closed for applications, however, I will keep a future iteration under consideration.</p><p><b>- Community Enhancement Programme (CEP): </b>The CEP programme in 2021 provided &euro;4.5m funding for small capital grants to community groups with the aim of enhancing facilities in disadvantaged areas.  It supports small-scale funding for projects which can range from the purchase of equipment to minor renovations to buildings.  It is envisaged that the CEP will run again later in 2022, however, details of the fund and the allocations available have not yet been confirmed.</p><p>Organisations who wish to be contacted should a targeted call open later in 2022, can provide their relevant contact details to my Department at csp@drcd.ie and we will keep them on file and notify them at the appropriate time. </p><p>In the interim, as the selection of new CSP organisations following an open call can be a lengthy process, organisations that currently require immediate supports should consider contacting their Local Development Company who may be able to provide some guidance on other supports available at this time, including the Department of Social Protection's Rural Social Scheme (RSS), TUS and Community Employment (CE) schemes.</p><p><b>- LEADER</b>: Funding for the service referenced may be available through the LEADER Programme.  LEADER is a multi-annual programme covering the period 2014-2022 which is delivered through 29 Local Action Groups (LAGs) around the country. </p><p>Support under the LEADER programme is provided under a broad range of themes.  In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. </p><p>Prospective applicants should, in the first instance, contact their relevant LAG, through its Implementing Partner, to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available.  The list of all Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on the Gov.ie website.</p><p>All prospective applicants should carefully consider the detailed guidance documentation that is issued by my Department as part of the application process for the various programmes listed to ensure that they meet the criteria set out.  Queries relating to the application process for any of the programmes listed above can be forwarded directly to the unit responsible.  Contact details can be found on the website gov.ie.</p><p>I would also encourage interested parties, such as the meals-on-wheels community groups referenced by the Deputy, to stay in touch with the Local Development Company, the Local Community Development Committee and their Local Authority, so that they are aware of grant schemes from across Government Departments and state agencies, as they become available.</p></reply>
