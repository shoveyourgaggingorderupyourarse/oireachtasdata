Consideration is not currently being given in the draft <i>Strategy</i>to extending such a rail link beyond Navan to Kingscourt. </p><p>The <i>Strategy</i>is subject to a formal statutory approval process and a final version is expected to be submitted for my approval from the NTA in the near future. The draft review is recommending the development of a rail link to Navan and I understand that this rail link will utilise the old Kingscourt Line over a short distance to connect the proposed Navan Central station and a proposed Navan North station.</p><p>Separately, the Deputy may be aware of the <i>Strategic Rail Review, </i>which is being undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland. This <i>Review</i>will inform the development of the railway sector on the Island of Ireland over the coming decades. </p><p>The <i>Review</i>is considering the potential scope for improved rail services along various existing and potential future corridors of the network, and that scope will also include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines such as the Kingscourt line referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>I expect to receive the final report from the All-Island Strategic Rail Review in the coming months and it is my intention to publish it before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the planning, design, improvement and upgrading of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. TII ultimately delivers the National Roads Programme in line with Project Ireland 2040, the National Planning Framework and the NDP.</p>  <p>  A priority in the NDP, in line with the Department&rsquo;s typical investment hierarchy, is to maintain the quality and safety of the existing national road network. The NDP foresees an exchequer allocation of circa &euro;2.9 billion for the Protection and Renewal of existing national roads over the 10-year period to 2030 (excluding Public Private Partnerships), allocated fairly evenly across the decade.</p>  <p>  I understand from TII that they are aware that Cork County Council intends to submit a Feasibility and Options report seeking funding for proposed safety improvements on the N71 at Leap National School.</p>  <p>  TII understands that the requested funding will be sought to carry out improvements at the existing zebra crossing at the church car park and playground rather than specific traffic calming measures through the 50 kilometre per hour speed limit area. Cork County Council also have the power to request a change to the speed limit which TII would then consider. A review of speed limits in County Cork is currently underway and is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that TII provide funding via the road safety improvement programme subject to the local authority fully costing their proposals and evaluating the safety benefit. This is carried out in accordance with TII&rsquo;s Road Safety Improvement Schemes Approval Procedure, for which proposals are submitted to TII in the form of a Feasibility and Options Report. </p>  <p>  TII awaits submission of the Feasibility and Options Report from Cork County Council before any further steps can be taken.</p>  <p>  With regard to safety on roads outside schools more generally, the Safe Routes to School (SRTS) Programme was launched by my Department in March 2021 and we provide funding to An Taisce Green Schools through the National Transport Authority (NTA) to administer this programme. SRTS aims to support walking, scooting and cycling to primary and post-primary schools, and to create safer walking and cycling routes within communities, through the provision of infrastructure interventions. Such measures should alleviate congestion at school gates and see an increase in the number of students who walk or cycle to school.</p>  <p>  931 applications were received from schools across every county in Ireland. 170 schools were selected for inclusion in the first round. It should be noted that all schools that applied to the original call for applications were accepted into the programme, and if not selected in Round 1 will be selected for forthcoming rounds. &euro;15 million has been allocated for projects in Round 1. To date, 16 schools have had front-of-school works completed under SRTS and 3 more are in construction. All other Round 1 schools are at varying points of planning, consultation or design. The selection process for Round 2 schools will take place in the coming months.</p></reply>

This has been a great help to people across the country in terms of making public transport more affordable, particularly in the context of the cost-of-living issues we all now face. </p>  <p>  Separately, Government has also funded the introduction by the NTA of the Young Adult Card to allow 19-23 year olds avail of a further 50% discount on all PSO services across bus and rail which was initially rolled out on all PSO services in May, and which has now been extended to cover participating commercial bus services since earlier this month. </p>  <p>  These initiatives build on changes already introduced such as the TFI90 fare in Dublin and the extension of the Leap Card in Cork and overall are helping to make public transport a more attractive and affordable choice for people across the country.  </p>  <p>  These fare initiatives complement the increases in public transport services Government is supporting through the roll out this year of BusConnects Dublin, improved rural transport services through Connecting Ireland, expanded rail services which are currently the subject of consultation and continued planning and development of service improvements generally. In addition significant amounts of capital expenditure are being allocated to improve public transport infrastructure also. </p>  <p>  Government has supported significant fare initiatives across the system and I am keen to ensure these initiatives continue into 2023. Ultimately all of these issues will form part of the ongoing of the ongoing Budget 2023 discussions. </p></reply>

The DART+ Programme will double the rail capacity in the Greater Dublin Area and will be the cornerstone of rail investment in the Area for the coming years.</p>  <p>  Government approval last December permitted Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to enter into a ten-year procurement framework for new DART fleet and immediately purchase 95 new units. DART+ Fleet is of particular importance to upgrading the northern line from Connolly Station as it will enable improved services beyond Malahide, through north county Dublin and as far as Drogheda, in advance of any potential later electrification. This will be achieved through the use of battery-electric units on the northern line, delivering improved frequencies, better journey times and expanded services for passengers. This new DART fleet should enter service in 2025. </p>  <p>  Secondly, there is the purchase of 41 additional intercity railcars, delivery of which has recently commenced. These new railcars will allow for enhanced services across the rail network when introduced into service in 2023.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the National Transport Authority that it is working with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to review where best to deploy the 41 new passenger railcars, which will increase capacity in many areas across the network. These new carriages give us the flexibility to respond to changing passenger demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  As part of this ongoing work by the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on a network-wide basis, in respect of the Dublin to Waterford line, consideration will be given providing new and additional carriages where demand, available carriages and suitable infrastructure support such provision.</p>  <p>  Deputies may also be interested in the draft Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann train timetable recently published for public consultation. This includes a range of proposed rail service improvements to apply from this December. This includes a proposed new morning return train service, Monday to Friday, on the Waterford line, operating between Carlow and Dublin. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-22a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092200055#WRA02100"><p>The Bus Network Redesign is an important element of the overall BusConnects programme, which will ultimately transform bus services and infrastructure in Dublin. Implementation of the Network Redesign is designed to roll out over the course of 11 phases over the coming years and that roll out has already commenced. </p>  <p>  The first phase - the H-Spine - launched in June 2021 and serves Howth and Malahide. Initial reactions have been positive with good bus passenger numbers, even with COVID restrictions in place at the time of launch. The second phase - the C-Spine - launched in November 2021. This serves the west of Dublin and east Kildare, including Lucan, Leixlip and Maynooth. It also introduced a much-improved network of local services, and some 24-hour bus services. The 90-minute fare was launched to coincide with Phase 2 on 28th November 2021. </p>  <p>  The third phase was rolled out in May this year and introduced two new Northern Orbital routes, the N4 connecting Blanchardstown to Point Village, and N6 connecting Finglas with Howth Junction.</p>  <p>  With new bus services being introduced as part of BusConnects, there are varying impacts on staffing requirements. Both Dublin Bus and Go Ahead Ireland are running extensive driver recruitment campaigns. Recent discussions have indicated confidence in their ability to deliver phase 4, of BusConnects, the G-Spine from Spenser Dock to Ballyfermot, in mid-October. This phase has been given the formal approval to proceed.</p>  <p>  The launch of Phase 5, the Southside Orbitals, is currently planned for early December. The launch date will, however, continue to be monitored to ensure driver availability and a formal decision on when to introduce the new services will be made in late October. A similar approach will be adopted for phases scheduled to be introduced in 2023.</p>  <p>  Assuming the 2023 rollout of the Network Redesign proceeds on schedule, the F-Spine from Finglas to Kimmage and the E-Spine from Ballymun to Bray will be introduced in the first half of next year. The D-Spine, from Clongriffin to Crumlin is then expected to launch in the second half of 2023.</p></reply>

It will inform the development of the railway sector on the Island of Ireland over the coming decades.</p><p>The <i>Strategic Rail Review</i>is considering the future of the rail network with regard to the following ambitions: improving sustainable connectivity between the major cities (including the potential for higher/high-speed), enhancing regional accessibility, supporting balanced regional development and rail connectivity to our international gateways. This also includes the role of rail freight.</p><p>The Review is also considering the scope for improved rail services and infrastructure along the various existing, or potential future, corridors of the network including disused and closed lines. </p><p>Following a competitive tendering process, Arup was appointed to undertake the <i>Review,</i>which commenced last September. A public consultation process ran from 26th November 2021 to 21st January 2022. Submissions made as part of that public consultation have been considered in detail and form a key input into the work of the Review.</p><p>The Government has previously stated our belief in the potential of rail. It is vital that we address constraints in the rail sector and achieve a strategy which allows rail to fulfil its potential as a sustainable mode of transport in pursuit of decarbonisation priorities and rural connectivity objectives and as a generator of prosperity for people across Ireland.  </p><p>The <i>Strategic Rail Review</i>will assist in, and inform, that and I look forward to its completion later this year and the final report which is expected in Quarter 4.

In that regard the NTA has conducted extensive analysis of the transport needs of towns, villages and rural areas as part of the Connecting Ireland programme. </p><p>With regard to the Deputy's specific question regarding the number of towns with a population of over 1,000 persons that do not have a daily commuting bus service, the NTA have advised that using the latest available Census data from 2016, 269 towns and settlements were identified as having a population of over 1,000 people, this excludes the 5 Cities and their metropolitan areas, and of these 269 settlements, approximately 74 do not currently have a direct daily commuter service. </p><p>For the purpose of their analysis, the NTA defined a commuter service as a PSO or Commercially operated fixed route, limited stop or express service connecting a settlement with its closest city or regional centre, providing a two-way service to meet the traditional working / college hours of 9am to 5pm.</p><p>I am advised that of the settlements identified as having no commuter service, the majority had a population of under 2,000 in 2016. It should also be noted that in a number of cases whilst direct commuter services may not exist, many of these towns have alternative options available. For example, whilst no direct commuter service exists between Abbeyleix and Dublin, it is possible to take the 828 local link service from Abbeyleix to Portlaoise to connect with rail services to Dublin, allowing for arrival in Dublin just before 9am. </p><p>This Government is firmly committed to enhancing and expanding our public transport services provision across the country and the funding for Public Service Obligation services has increased in recent years to cater for network enhancements and growing capacity.</p><p>One of the key plans for enhancing the existing transport network across Ireland falls under the previously discussed <i><font color="#242424">Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility plan,</font></i>which aims to develop an integrated, accessible, and sustainable network of public transport offerings across Ireland. </p></reply>

Recognising the interests expressed by various parties who would like to see a revised policy delivered quickly, I have asked my officials to present me with possible options on how the work on the revision of the policy could be brought forward in the near term. </p>  <p>  In exploring such options due consideration will be given to the existing National Aviation Policy, in particular in areas where it is evident the policy continues to deliver its objectives.  The National Aviation Policy published in 2015, as medium to long-term policy, was designed to create an environment that would encourage the industry to increase connectivity to and from Ireland for the benefit of the travelling public, Irish tourism and business. It is clear that this has been realised and as such the principal goals of the policy remain valid.</p>  <p>  Additionally, options considered will need to have due regard to the changed environment the industry finds itself in, not least of all the sustainability and decarbonisation challenges that lies ahead. </p>  <p>  As previously committed, we recognise that no process would be complete or robust without stakeholder consultation which provides invaluable input and experience for consideration.   </p>  <p>  In parallel with this, work in my department will also include a mid-term review of the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2022. While my Department is currently focused on assessing applications for  the disbursement of &euro;22m in operational grant aid under the Regional Airports Programme to eligible airports (Shannon, Cork, Knock, Kerry and Donegal) before the end of this year, I have asked my officials to commence the mid-term review of the Regional Airports Programme once this funding has been disbursed.</p></reply>

The National Development Plan provides &euro;35 billion for transport over the next decade, the largest investment in transport in the history of the state. This provides the necessary support to translate our ambitions for public transport into reality. </p>  <p>  Rail service planning carried out by the National Transport Authority (NTA) working with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann (Irish Rail) is fully aligned with service planning policy as set out in NTA&rsquo;s Connecting Ireland programme. The NTA has engaged with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to develop a programme of service improvements that are intended to recognise recent significant and likely permanent changes in the pattern of rail travel brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. A suite of service improvements has been developed to make the most of this opportunity to diversify and develop new markets for rail travel.</p>  <p>  The proposed revisions recognise the needs of different rail markets. For example, the NTA has proposed improvements on suburban rail corridors reflecting service planning policy to provide a coherent level of service addressing all needs across the entire week in order to reduce car dependence in these urban markets, instead of focusing mostly on the journey to work and to education. The intercity market has different characteristics. Intercity service planning policy intends to offer a better spread of arrivals into regional cities and large towns. All changes will need to be agreed with Irish Rail and where necessary funding approval will be required.</p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in conjunction with the NTA are planning to implement timetable alterations from the 11th of December 2022, subject to the availability of funding. Public consultation has commenced and can be accessed here: www.irishrail.ie/en-ie/news/Proposed-timetable-changes-from-11th-December-2022</p>  <p>  This process commences with the publication of a Draft Timetable on Irish Rail&rsquo;s website and requests customers or potential customers to comment on the proposal while also requesting comments in general or on service alterations or additions which they would like to see implemented. This process provides customers with direct input into the planning and design of the rail timetable while also providing an accurate assessment of potential demand for services and associated alterations. This process has seen numerous service alterations to initial draft timetables and this feedback is directly reviewed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Management and the NTA.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately a limiting factor at present is the availability of train drivers. Irish Rail are planning to increase the number of driver school classes it can run in order to have drivers available to operate any new services proposed.</p>  <p>  The NTA is currently working with Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann to review where best to deploy 41 new passenger railcars which have started to arrive and will continue to arrive throughout 2023 which will increase capacity in many areas. Passenger demand has changed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic across the whole rail network. Consideration will be given to amending train lengths where capacity, demand, available railcars and suitable infrastructure are appropriate, and also subject to availability of the necessary funding.</p></reply>

Essentially the route runs on regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and on national routes from Cavan to Sligo. </p>  <p>  As regards the regional road aspect of the proposal, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </p>  <p>  Going back some time there was a proposal for a substantial upgrade of the regional road part of the route. The Department provided funding to Cavan County Council (acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth County Councils) of over &euro;2 million in the period 2007-2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design.</p>  <p>  More recent appraisal work undertaken on the scheme pointed to a very substantial cost if the full scheme were to be implemented.</p>  <p>  In light of that, the Department engaged with Cavan County Council in relation to carrying out a risk-based analysis for the east-west route between Dundalk and Cavan which involved exploring the possibility of a series of interventions which could be implemented over a period of time and which could improve the safety of the route, improve journey times and bring consistency to the travel speed along the route. </p>  <p>  On foot of this risk analysis it is envisaged that individual local authorities will now examine, taking into account each Council's overall priorities and available resources, how projects identified in the risk analysis could be brought forward. </p>  <p>  The Department has allocated some grant funding this year to Cavan County Council and Louth County Council for the initial assessment of two possible schemes subject to the receipt of the required project appraisal documentation from the relevant local authorities. </p>  <p>  As regards the national road element of an east-west link, I have referred the question to Transport Infrastructure Ireland for a direct reply.

The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is now available online. </p><p>In order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that the generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentive fossil-fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. A cross departmental committee has been established to implement the recommendations and is due to report on progress in Q4 this year.  </p><p>On 21st July I launched a new dedicated Office, Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, which will oversee and accelerate Ireland&rsquo;s transition to zero emission vehicles.

I most recently met with the Irish Road Haulage Association (IRHA) on 20 September to discuss its views ahead of Budget 2023. I also attended and spoke at the IRHA Annual Conference earlier this month.</p>  <p>  I will not pre-empt the Budget, however the Government is fully aware of the increased costs that the haulage sector, like many others, has been facing over recent months. </p>  <p>  The Government has already taken a number of steps to support the sector.</p>  <p>  In March, the Government approved specific financial support for the sector via the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme. The Scheme provided a temporary financial support of &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. It was administered by the Department of Transport, and it is now closed. There was good uptake of the Scheme, with over &euro;15.6 million paid out to c.3,100 operators.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Diesel Rebate Scheme remains available to licensed haulage operators in respect of vehicles over 7.5 tonnes. At diesel prices over &euro;1.43 (including VAT), the maximum rebate of 7.5 cent per litre is provided. It has always been the case that some operators that are eligible for the DRS do not take it up. The Department strongly encourages all such operators to make the most of the supports that are available. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, tax debt &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; during the COVID crisis remains at an interest rate of 0% for the remainder of this year.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Government also acted to offset the rising cost of fuel through a reduction in Excise on fuels - a reduction of 20 cent on petrol and 15 cent on diesel fuel. While this measure was originally proposed to last until 31 August 2022 the Government has extended it out to Budget Day 2022. This measure provides assistance to all citizens and businesses to help mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases.</p>  <p>  Since early March with the benefit of the excise reduction, support under the Licensed Haulage Support Scheme and the ongoing Diesel Rebate relief, haulage businesses will have had the opportunity to revise and renegotiate contracts with their clients in order to reflect increased prices, as is an unfortunate reality in all sectors across the economy.</p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. </p></reply>

The public transport industry has been particularly hard-hit with many operators experiencing difficulties in recruiting drivers as they attempt to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity, as well as deliver intended service improvements such as the BusConnects Network Redesign in Dublin.</p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority is in regular contact with bus operators, who are making every attempt to recruit more drivers so that all services can run as scheduled. Several operators have undertaken extensive driver recruitment campaigns in recent months with staff levels beginning to improve gradually, and significant numbers of additional drivers expected to become available once their required training and tests are complete and licences are issued by the Road Safety Authority (RSA). The National Transport Authority has engaged with the RSA to expedite the testing and licence issue process for new bus drivers. In addition the Authority has undertaken a national advertising campaign to attract bus drivers to the industry.</p>  <p>  The impact of shortfalls in driver numbers is felt the most when low-frequency services are cancelled. The Authority and operators have been working to ensure that such cancellations are minimised, that &ndash; where possible &ndash; consecutive low frequency services are not withdrawn, and that first and last daily services on a route operate.</p>  <p>  The NTA is aware of the major inconvenience that the current poor service performance is causing for passengers. However, operators are forecasting significant improvements in reliability in the coming months, dependent on successful recruitment and retention of critical staff, in particular drivers. I will continue to engage with the NTA to ensure that all operators in the bus market provide a satisfactory level of service to meet the demands of customers in line with their contracts.</p></reply>

In transport, HVO is a biofuel which can be blended with diesel and is produced from waste feedstocks such as used cooking oil (UCO) or tallow. It is a particularly relevant to the ongoing decarbonisation of hard to abate sectors such as road haulage.</p>  <p>  Biofuels are a core transitional technology relied upon for the medium-term reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the road transport sector. In 2021, under the renewable transport fuel obligation approximately 246m litres (7.6 PJ) of liquid biofuel and 618k Nm3 (0.2 PJ) of gaseous biofuel were placed on the market; approximately 623kt of carbon savings were awarded in respect of those disposals.</p>  <p>  The  Renewable Fuel for Transport Policy Statement 2021 sets out the pathway to the achievement of Climate Action Plan targets and European obligations concerning renewable transport fuel. This is implemented through the renewable transport fuel blending obligation on fuel suppliers, as set out under Part 5A of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007.</p>  <p>  Among the aims of the renewable transport fuel policy is to ensure sustainability and GHG reduction criteria are met, and to incentivise advanced and development renewable fuels supply in the transport sector. In this regards, officials of my Department engage with the European Commission on an ongoing bases, including through the working group on sustainability, set up under the Renewable Energy Directive.</p>  <p>  This year the Department undertook a stakeholder and public consultation, on the renewable transport fuel policy implementation and future direction; and will publish a summary report of this consultation shortly. The written consultation sought views concerning the incentivisation of the supply of HVO for use in the road transport sector. It is noted that there was no submission received from local authorities as part of the consultation process. </p>  <p>  Work is also ongoing to ensure that the suite of measures set out in the renewable transport fuel policy are enabled through legislation and are implemented within the timeframes set out in the policy.</p>  <p>  The future approach for the next iteration of the policy on renewable transport fuel will be the focus of a consultation in early 2023. The report of the study commissioned by the Department concerning the sustainability and availability of biofuels including HVO, which is at an advanced stage, will further inform the future Policy.</p></reply>

My Department launched the Alternatively-Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle Purchase Grant Scheme in March 2021, which partly funds the purchase of new alternatively fuelled large vans, trucks, buses and coaches. Funding of &euro;3m was allocated to the Scheme this year and it is expected that the scheme will once again be funded in 2023. Ireland also has the Low Emission Vehicle Toll Incentive which offers toll discounts for alternatively-fuelled vehicles.</p>  <p>  With regard to a scrappage scheme for the older vehicles the European Green Deal includes a specific commitment for the removal of subsidies for fossil fuels at the national level.  Financial support for the uptake of EURO VI and EURO VII diesel trucks is not consistent with that commitment and it is not likely to be possible to progress such a Scheme in line with EU State Aid rules.</p>  <p>  However, the Government is committed to increasing the use of biofuels as a means to support emissions reductions for diesel vehicles. Under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme a percentage of the motor fuel in Ireland is obligated to be produced from renewable sources. On 21 January 2022, this percentage was increased from 12.359% to 14.942% by volume. It is intended to raise this percentage to 20% biodiesel by 2030, a move which will help to significantly reduce emissions from the haulage sector. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to publish a ten-year strategy for the haulage sector. This strategy will focus on generating efficiencies, improving standards, and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future and will be published before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Once complete, the programme will deliver a doubling of existing DART capacity.</p><p>The Government decision on DART+ from December 2021 included specific approvals to purchase additional DART fleet for the DART+ West project to enter the statutory planning process. In respect of new DART+ fleet, a down payment was made for 95 new electric and battery-electric units at the end last year, with these units expected to enter service in 2025. In respect of DART+ West, a Railway Order application was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on 29 July and the consultation period is now open. </p><p>Further extensions to DART services in the years ahead are being considered as part of the NTA&rsquo;s review of the <i>Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area</i>. The revised draft <i>Strategy</i>includes proposals to extend DART services beyond Maynooth and Celbridge/Hazelhatch. However, any such extensions are separate projects to DART+ West and DART+ South West and would require their own approvals.</p><p>The Deputy may recall, in addition to the DART+ Fleet project, the Government has previously approved the purchase of 41 additional intercity railcars.  These additional carriages, the first of which arrived in Ireland in recent weeks, will allow for enhanced services in the GDA upon entry into service in 2023.</p><p>In relation to park and ride facilities, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure in our cities, including park and ride facilities through the Park and Ride Development Office. Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a direct reply.  Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days.</p></reply>

These materials can be found on the LSCSG webpage at www.gov.ie.  </p><p>Collaboration among members of the LSCSG has led to new educational opportunities &ndash; for example the recently launched Transport Operations and Commercial Driver Apprenticeship at ATU Sligo, which allows students to earn as they learn, gaining a higher education qualification as well as their professional driving qualification.</p><p>The LSCSG recently attended the World Skills Ireland 2022 event in the RDS and I had the pleasure to visit the Group&rsquo;s stand at World Skills, seeing first-hand the great work they are doing to promote the sector. </p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to publish a 10-year strategy for the haulage sector. This Strategy will, among other things, build on and continue the work of the LSCSG in tackling the driver shortage and addressing the skills gap.</p><p>Regarding the recognition of Ukrainian licences,<b></b>EU Regulation 2022/1280 allows Ukrainians residing in Ireland under the Temporary Protection Directive to drive here on their current national driving licences, for the period of temporary protection. All categories held on a Ukrainian driving licence are recognised.</p><p>To drive a truck or bus professionally in Ireland, a person must have a driver certificate of professional competence (CPC). The EU Regulation allows for recognition of Ukrainian CPCs, subject to the holder undergoing additional compulsory training. The RSA is developing an additional compulsory training programme. </p><p>Regarding licence exchange agreements with other non-EU countries, Ireland is engaging with North Macedonia and Argentina with a view to such agreements. Currently, clarification is being sought from the Argentinian authorities on a number of issues. The most recent response from North Macedonia is under review.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is also engaged with public transport operators regarding the issue of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  The Department has also been engaging regularly with the NTA, the three CI&Eacute; companies and Luas, on the issue of anti-social behaviour and a significant number of actions have been taken. These include; </p>  <p>  -  On the 29th of July, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Transdev &amp;amp; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carried out a joint awareness day (operation twintrack) to prevent anti-social behaviour on our services and to raise awareness of staying safe on public transport.</p>  <p>  -  Joint Garda &amp;amp; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann high visibility public safety operations took place across the network over the Easter period with a number of fines issued. Reportable ASB incidents on Irish Rail have reduced from 654 in 2020 to 549 in 2021.</p>  <p>  -  I&Eacute; Security Centre at Howth Junction - Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have appointed a supervisory team who coordinates the security response in the Greater Dublin Area.  Additionally, there is the deployment of public facing Security Teams in identified Anti-social behaviour hot spots across the DART and Rail Network.</p>  <p>  -  There are nine Rapid Response Hubs in operation across the I&Eacute; Intercity Network with the latest, Mullingar, having come into operation on 9th May 2022 (The 9 locations: Mallow, Limerick Junction, Thurles, Portlaoise, Athlone, Kildare, Longford, Castlerea and Mullingar). These hubs are now fully operational with all onboard staff having dedicated phone numbers for each of the hub locations in the event they require assistance.  These hubs provide reassurance for both staff and customers.  The Kilkenny hub is also due to come into operation today, which will complete the first phase of this initiative, bringing the total number of Rapid Response Hubs in operation to ten.  This means should on-board staff request assistance by calling ahead to the next Garda Rapid Response Hub, they will receive priority service to deal with any issue.  Since coming into operation, this level of response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had a very positive impact in reducing the potential for such passenger issues escalating.</p>  <p>  -  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have recruited a Security Enforcement &amp;amp; Compliance Manager and a Crime Prevention &amp;amp; Antisocial Behaviour Officer to design out crime.</p>  <p>  -  CCTV is available on most trains and has successfully been used on numerous occasions in securing prosecutions. They are also in place in stations.</p>  <p>  -  A DART text alert line has been established for discrete reporting of Anti-Social incidents.</p>  <p>  -  In respect of Dublin Services, Public Transport Hubs have been established for Heuston Plaza and Connolly Plaza.  A third one at Broombridge, Cabra, will come into operation shortly.  This is a Joint initiative between public transport providers Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann/Transdev (LUAS)/Dublin Bus/Bus &Eacute;ireann and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Community Engagement Units at Kevin Street, Store Street and Cabra. </p>  <p>  -  Transdev/ LUAS employ 50 security staff. These staff are involved in maintaining safety and security on the Luas, along with enforcing the Luas bye-laws. They liaise with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly as part of their work.</p>  <p>  -  In relation to security on our public bus services, the entire Dublin Bus fleet is fully fitted with CCTV cameras, with up to 11 internal cameras and three external cameras fitted on the more modern vehicles in the fleet. Each vehicle is equipped with a radio, which facilitates immediate contact to the Central Control Centre.</p>  <p>  -  Dublin Bus has also re-introduced their Schools Education Programme (previously suspended due to Covid-19) which involves educating young people about the importance of the bus in their lives and in their local community. The work of their School and Community Co-ordinators has also proven highly successful in encouraging young people to respect their bus and has assisted greatly in the reduction of incidents of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  -  Beyond this Dublin Bus has a strong and close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have set up a number of community forums in different areas across the city. These forums are made up of Dublin Bus representatives, the Garda&iacute;, local area representatives, community groups and Trade Union Representatives.</p>  <p>  -  Bus &Eacute;ireann has similarly also invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout its fleet for the protection of passengers and staff. Emergency support for drivers is provided through 24-hour control centres and any incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required.</p>  <p>  -  All Bus &Eacute;ireann city and town buses are fitted with driver security screens. Security personnel are employed in our larger bus stations and extensive CCTV is also in operation throughout all stations to ensure the security of our staff, customers and property.  Furthermore, customer research shows that 93% of Bus &Eacute;ireann customers feel safe and secure during their journeys.</p>  <p>  Further, the Third National Strategy for Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence references the implementation of specific Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence actions in the annual public transport passenger safety and personal security report (action 1.6.3 in the Implementation Plan). The NTA have advised that they are in the process of designing the report contents, with the detailed work due to be undertaken next year, which will supplement the Authority&rsquo;s annual customer survey on satisfaction with their personal safety on board public transport as well as at the stop/station. The first Annual public transport passenger safety and personal security report will be delivered next year.</p>  <p>  The combined interventions implemented to date across our public transport services have substantially helped to tackle anti-social behaviour; however, this is an issue which will require on-going monitoring. As such, I am committed to continuing to work collectively with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public, and the safest possible working environment for the employees providing our valuable public transport services.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts. </p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  </p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have forwarded the Deputies questions in relation to free public transport, to the NTA for direct reply.

The increase has been designed so as to encourage more drivers to operate during these periods and also encourage drivers who may still not have come back since the pandemic, to re-activate their licences.</p>  <p>  -  The NTA&rsquo;s launch of a driver recruitment campaign this summer to promote the sector as a place of employment for people. It is hoped that the expected increase in the number of drivers following this campaign, will impact the numbers available to work during the early hours of the morning, particularly at weekends. </p>  <p>  -  The eSPSV Grant Scheme to which I allocated &euro;15m toward this year alone and which supports drivers in their transition to zero / low emission vehicles. The number of eSPSV grants administered has been encouraging, with 1052 grants paid between the beginning of the scheme in 2018 to 16th September 2022, with associated funding of &euro;18,524,500m.</p>  <p>  -  The eSPSV Business Loan provided by Microfinance Ireland to support those SPSV owners accessing the eSPSV Grant Scheme but who are unable to secure finance from financial institutions.</p>  <p>  -  Government&rsquo;s generally applicable reduction in fuel related duties introduced earlier this year.</p>  <p>  -  The NTA&rsquo;s previous extensions of the Maximum Permissible Age for vehicles during the Covid-19 pandemic, which ensured no operator exited the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.</p>  <p>  In addition, the NTA has this week announced a public consultation on a further extension to the Maximum Permissible Age of vehicles in recognition of the difficulties currently being experienced by operators in sourcing new vehicles. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the fact that some SPSV drivers have not worked since the start of the pandemic, the NTA also extended the period to 24 months that an SPSV licence may rest in inactive status after expiry (previously 12 months).

These have been exacerbated by international events.</p><p>Ireland is at the beginning of its transition to private electric transport. Within a few years I anticipate there will be a viable second hand market that will provide a more affordable pathway to the purchase of an EV. In addition, the motor industry is planning to bring more affordable electric vehicles onto the market.  </p><p>My Department convened the <i>Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group</i>to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. This <i>Group </i>considered a variety of regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to accelerate EV adoption. The <i>Group</i>also examined the issue of price parity between EVs and ICE vehicles and found that parity in respect of the Total Cost of Ownership is likely to be achieved later on this decade, driven by falling battery prices and savings due to economies of scale. </p><p>In the meantime, in order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that the generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years. </p><p>An Implementation Group has been established to progress the recommendations and consider further potential measures and barriers to the adoption of the EVs. This Group will report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year.  </p><p>On 21st July I launched a new dedicated Office, Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, which will oversee and accelerate Ireland&rsquo;s transition to zero emission vehicles. A suite of new of grants and initiatives have been launched with further information available at  www.gov.ie/zevi.</p><p>The use of e-bikes is proving to be an increasingly popular method of travel, encouraging more people to switch to cycling and to cycle longer distances. A particular barrier to use of e-bikes can be the price as they are often more expensive than a regular bike. Bearing this in mind, and referencing the commitment by the Government to continue the provision of increased funding to Active Travel measures, I can assure the Deputy that potential incentives to encourage the purchase of bikes and e-bikes are being considered as part of the budgetary process. </p><p>Finally, there are provisions in the Road Traffic and Roads Bill to legislate for the use of powered personal transporters, specifically e-scooters. When the Bill is passed, I, as Minister, will have the power to make regulations for the use of this new category of vehicles on our roads.</p></reply>

Calls are open to projects across the EU and are usually heavily oversubscribed. Co-funding rates differ depending on the conditions of each call but for Irish projects these typically range from 30% to 50% of eligible costs.</p>  <p>  The CEF Transport 2022 funding call was launched by the EU Commission on 13 September. It has an overall budget of &euro;5.12 billion which is divided into a number of separate calls focused on various funding priorities. </p>  <p>  The total budget of the calls for which Irish projects are eligible is &euro;2.47 billion. The areas covered by these calls include: railways, maritime ports, roads, freight terminals, infrastructure resilience, transport information systems, and passenger hubs. </p>  <p>  We circulated information on the call by email to our CEF mailing list on 13 September. The Department's twitter account published a series of tweets on the call on the same date. We have also updated the gov.ie information page on CEF and TEN-T (www.gov.ie/en/publication/331b18-trans-european-network-for-transport-ten-t-and-connecting-europe-fac/) with relevant information and links.</p>  <p>  These communications all include a registration link for the EU's virtual information day on the call which will take place on 5 October. My Department also intends to hold its own information day for Irish stakeholders in October, we expect to be able to confirm the exact date soon.</p>  <p>  The Department is required to endorse any applications from Ireland and my officials aim to review and provide feedback to all applicants on their proposals. To facilitate this process, we have set deadlines by which information should be submitted to us. These deadlines are available on the gov.ie information page on CEF and TEN-T.</p>  <p>  My officials have already engaged with a number of prospective Irish applicants, including Irish Rail, on the funding opportunities available under this year's CEF call. Officials in the Department remain available to provide information on the call to anyone considering making an application.</p></reply>

While the establishment of air services is a commercial matter between airports, airlines and other market actors, the Regional Airports Programme provides for a PSO air services scheme in compliance with Regulation (EC) No. 1008/2008. Under this scheme financial support is provided to airlines that operate essential air services to isolated areas &ndash; those not adequately served by alternative transport services to administrative, business, education and medical centres.  </p>  <p>  With regard to expanding current PSO services, over the past 10 years Ireland has significantly rationalised PSO air services, with only one such route now supported under this scheme between Donegal/Dublin.   It would be a significant shift to expand Government policy for the support of PSO services beyond that of support on domestic routes. It would also be important to consider the potential impact of such a policy, not only on the Exchequer, but also on similar routes operating on a commercial basis from other regional airports.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is Government policy that State-owned airports operate on a fully commercial basis without recourse to Exchequer funding.  However, in light of the devastating impacts of COVID-19 and in recognition of the importance of Shannon Airport and Cork Airport to their respective regional and local economies, government provided on an exceptional basis funding to both Shannon and Cork airports.</p>  <p>  In addition to the horizontal COVID-19 supports provided to all businesses, over &euro;22 million in Exchequer supports were allocated to Shannon Airport in 2021.  This year, in light of its suppressed passenger numbers, Shannon Airport can also avail of supports under the Regional Airports Programme.  I allocated &euro;4.3m in capital funding to Shannon Airport in April which will support the completion of a broad range of safety, security and sustainability focused projects.  Shannon Airport is also eligible for operational grant-aid under the Programme which I will allocate to eligible airports later this year from an overall budget of &euro;22 million. Shannon Airport will remain eligible for funding under the Programme in 2023.</p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that substantial Exchequer support recently provided to Shannon Airport has positioned the Airport for recovery and growth into the future, I have asked my department to expedite the consideration of this request.  </p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is also engaged with public transport operators regarding the issue of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  The Department has also been engaging regularly with the NTA and the three CI&Eacute; companies, on the issue of anti-social behaviour and a significant number of actions have been taken. These include; </p>  <p>  -  On the 29th of July, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Transdev &amp;amp; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carried out a joint awareness day (operation twintrack) to prevent anti-social behaviour on our services and to raise awareness of staying safe on public transport.</p>  <p>  -  Joint Garda &amp;amp; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann high visibility public safety operations took place across the network over the Easter period with a number of fines issued. Reportable ASB incidents on Irish Rail have reduced from 654 in 2020 to 549 in 2021.</p>  <p>  -  I&Eacute; Security Centre at Howth Junction - Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have appointed a supervisory team who coordinates the security response in the Greater Dublin Area.  Additionally, there is the deployment of public facing Security Teams in identified Anti-social behaviour hot spots across the DART and Rail Network.</p>  <p>  -  There are nine Rapid Response Hubs in operation across the I&Eacute; Intercity Network with the latest, Mullingar, having come into operation on 9th May 2022 (The 9 locations: Mallow, Limerick Junction, Thurles, Portlaoise, Athlone, Kildare, Longford, Castlerea and Mullingar). These hubs are now fully operational with all onboard staff having dedicated phone numbers for each of the hub locations in the event they require assistance.  These hubs provide reassurance for both staff and customers.  The Kilkenny hub is also due to come into operation today, which will complete the first phase of this initiative, bringing the total number of Rapid Response Hubs in operation to ten.  This means should on-board staff request assistance by calling ahead to the next Garda Rapid Response Hub, they will receive priority service to deal with any issue.  Since coming into operation, this level of response from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has had a very positive impact in reducing the potential for such passenger issues escalating.</p>  <p>  -  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have recruited a Security Enforcement &amp;amp; Compliance Manager and a Crime Prevention &amp;amp; Antisocial Behaviour Officer to design out crime.</p>  <p>  -  CCTV is available on most trains and has successfully been used on numerous occasions in securing prosecutions. They are also in place in stations.</p>  <p>  -  A DART text alert line has been established for discrete reporting of Anti-Social incidents.</p>  <p>  -  In respect of Dublin Services, Public Transport Hubs have been established for Heuston Plaza and Connolly Plaza.  A third one at Broombridge, Cabra, will come into operation shortly.  This is a Joint initiative between public transport providers Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann/Transdev (LUAS)/Dublin Bus/Bus &Eacute;ireann and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Community Engagement Units at Kevin Street, Store Street and Cabra. </p>  <p>  -  Transdev/ LUAS employ 50 security staff. These staff are involved in maintaining safety and security on the Luas, along with enforcing the Luas bye-laws. They liaise with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly as part of their work.</p>  <p>  -  In relation to security on our public bus services, the entire Dublin Bus fleet is fully fitted with CCTV cameras, with up to 11 internal cameras and three external cameras fitted on the more modern vehicles in the fleet. Each vehicle is equipped with a radio, which facilitates immediate contact to the Central Control Centre.</p>  <p>  -  Dublin Bus has also re-introduced their Schools Education Programme (previously suspended due to Covid-19) which involves educating young people about the importance of the bus in their lives and in their local community. The work of their School and Community Co-ordinators has also proven highly successful in encouraging young people to respect their bus and has assisted greatly in the reduction of incidents of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  -  Beyond this Dublin Bus has a strong and close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have set up a number of community forums in different areas across the city. These forums are made up of Dublin Bus representatives, the Garda&iacute;, local area representatives, community groups and Trade Union Representatives.</p>  <p>  -  Bus &Eacute;ireann has similarly also invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout its fleet for the protection of passengers and staff. Emergency support for drivers is provided through 24-hour control centres and any incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required.</p>  <p>  -  All Bus &Eacute;ireann city and town buses are fitted with driver security screens. Security personnel are employed in our larger bus stations and extensive CCTV is also in operation throughout all stations to ensure the security of our staff, customers and property.  Furthermore, customer research shows that 93% of Bus &Eacute;ireann customers feel safe and secure during their journeys.</p>  <p>  Further, the Third National Strategy for Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence references the implementation of specific Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence actions in the annual public transport passenger safety and personal security report (action 1.6.3 in the Implementation Plan). The NTA have advised that they are in the process of designing the report contents, with the detailed work due to be undertaken next year, which will supplement the Authority&rsquo;s annual customer survey on satisfaction with their personal safety on board public transport as well as at the stop/station. The first Annual public transport passenger safety and personal security report will be delivered next year.</p>  <p>  The combined interventions implemented to date across our public transport services have substantially helped to tackle anti-social behaviour; however, this is an issue which will require on-going monitoring. As such, I am committed to continuing to work collectively with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public, and the safest possible working environment for the employees providing our valuable public transport services.</p></reply>

Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced). In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. </p>  <p>  I am aware, there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that this new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. </p></reply>

It was asked to independently consider how best the taxation and welfare systems can support economic activity, and promote increased employment and prosperity while ensuring that there are sufficient resources available to meet the costs of the public services and supports in the medium and longer term.</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Foundations for the Future&rsquo;, the Report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, was published on 14 September.

While my Department will produce more definitive fiscal forecasts next week as part of the publication of Budget 2023, preliminary indications suggest corporation tax receipts of over &euro;20 billion can be expected this year. This would mean corporation tax receipts would be approximately &euro;13 billion higher than the levels seen in 2015 and will be effectively twice the pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019.</p><p>A level-shift of this magnitude, occurring over such a short timeframe, naturally raises questions regarding the sustainability of this revenue steam.

As a result, while the headline fiscal position may look very positive, it can mask very real vulnerabilities in our public finances. </p><p>Our recent history provides a stark reminder of the dangers attached to building permanent expenditure commitments on volatile revenue sources. During the Global Financial Crisis, the collapse of our property-related tax receipts meant that very painful public expenditure measures were necessary to return the public finances to a stable position. One of the areas to suffer the most severe cuts was public investment, with long-lasting implications for both growth potential and the provision of public services. The Government is determined to ensure that history is not repeated in this regard.</p><p>In relation to housing, the Government has significantly increased investment in this area in recent years. The capital budget allocated for this year was &euro;2.6 billion, with over &euro;6 billion allocated in capital funding towards housing in the past three years. This Government&rsquo;s housing plan, <i>Housing for All</i>, is backed by the largest ever housing budget in the history of the State.</p><p>Further details on the Government's spending plans will be announced next week but the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate to speculate on specific policy decisions in advance of Budget Day.</p></reply>

Just this month my Department published analysis highlighting the fiscal vulnerabilities stemming from the upward shift in corporate tax receipts in recent years in a paper titled <i>De-risking the Public Finances - Assessing Corporation Tax Receipts</i>. </p><p>Analysis contained in this publication shows the share of overall tax revenue accounted for by corporation tax receipts is now at historically high levels. Receipts have been on a steep upward trajectory since 2015, reaching &euro;15.3 billion last year, an increase of over 120 per cent relative to 2015.  </p><p>A level shift of this magnitude, occurring over such a short timeframe, naturally raises questions regarding the sustainability of this revenue steam. The concentration of these receipts within a small number of firms raises further concerns about their sustainability. Indeed, as the Deputy is aware, over half of corporate tax receipts are paid by just ten large payers. </p><p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to be definitive regarding the proportion of receipts which are potentially at risk. However, analysis set out in my Department&rsquo;s publication suggests the quantum of last year&rsquo;s CT receipts that could be viewed as &lsquo;windfall&rsquo; in nature could be in the region of &euro;4 to &euro;6 billion. As a result, there is a strong argument to treat a portion of corporation tax receipts as volatile, and hence, potentially non-stable, in nature. In doing so, we can address a key risk to the public finances and thereby help ensure our country&rsquo;s fiscal sustainability. The paper goes on to suggest that ring-fencing such windfall revenues in a forward-looking fund, such as a Resilience Fund or a re-launched version of the National Pension Reserve Fund, is one option to safeguard the future sustainability of the public finances.</p><p>In addition, in order to highlight this ongoing volatility risk, my Department will publish an estimate of the budgetary position excluding identified windfall receipts. This will be presented as a new indicator known as the GGB*, in Budget 2023.</p><p>In terms of reliance on foreign direct investment, it is very timely that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently reviewing our enterprise policy. The White Paper on Enterprise, due for completion in Q4 2022, will outline the strategic direction of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy in the context of challenges, opportunities and new drivers of growth.</p></reply>

Accordingly, for the tax year 2022, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heat and broadband in respect of those days spent working from home can be claimed by taxpayers. The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate.  </p><p>As of 19 September 2022, the volume of Remote Working Relief claims and their monetary value are as follows:</p><p>-  For 2022 (year to date), 2,643 claims to the value of &euro;1.1 million,</p><p>-  For 2021, 69,280 claims to the value of &euro;12.4 million,</p><p>-  For 2020, 118,000 claims to the value of &euro;19 million.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that these are unlikely to be the final figures for such claims, as taxpayers have up to four years to file their Income Tax Returns for a year and claim any additional expenses due.</p><p>Remote Working Relief claims can be made via Revenue&rsquo;s MyAccount, for years up to and including 2022. If making a claim for 2022 during 2022, the taxpayer is required to upload a readable image of his or her receipt(s) to Revenue&rsquo;s Receipts Tracker during the application as the amount claimed increases the taxpayer&rsquo;s current year tax credits for which he or she will see a benefit in his or her next payroll payment.</p><p>Separately to the foregoing, where e-workers incur certain extra expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment remotely or from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 per day to such employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC.</p><p>However, I wish to advise the Deputy that the &euro;3.20 daily allowance is a discretionary payment by an employer to his or her employees.

As of end-August, these receipts stood at nearly &euro;12 billion, and my Department now expects that total corporation tax revenue this year will top &euro;20 billion. </p><p>For comparison, a decade ago tax paid by the corporate sector amounted to approximately &euro;4 billion.</p><p>Certainly, these receipts are, in many respects, welcome. But as the Deputy will know, I have frequently warned of the risks around corporation tax. These revenues are built on an extremely narrow tax base, with the top ten large corporate payers paying more than half of all receipts. </p><p>This means that our tax base is vulnerable to the business decisions of a small number of large, highly profitable firms. As such, these unreliable and potentially volatile receipts are not an appropriate basis for funding permanent expenditure commitments. </p><p>In the <i>Summer Economic Statement</i>last year, this Government set out its medium-term budgetary framework. The fundamental basis of this strategy is that growth in core public expenditure will be linked to the trend growth rate of the economy, irrespective of upside surprises on revenue. By decoupling expenditure from windfall revenue, this will mitigate much of the risk of corporation tax receipts being used to fund expenditure.</p><p>For this year only, in recognition of the cost of living challenge, Government has temporarily departed from the parameters set out in this strategy, but for future years we will return to the original strategy.</p><p>This approach strikes the right balance between providing assistance today and keeping our public finances on a sustainable trajectory.</p><p>Finally, earlier this month my Department published a paper examining vulnerabilities around corporation tax. Using a range of different methodologies, this analysis suggests that the amount of corporation tax receipts that could be unsustainable is in the region of &euro;4 to &euro;6 billion. As a result, the headline figures may look very positive but can mask very real vulnerabilities in our public finances.</p><p>In order to highlight this ongoing risk, Government will publish an alternative measure of the fiscal position, excluding estimates of windfall corporation tax receipts, as part of the Budget Day documentation next week.</p></reply>

These estimates encompass all taxpayer types, such as those in employment, self-employed, or in receipt of taxable income from other sources. Due to the nature of taxable income, which arises from multiple sources, it is not possible to allocate taxpayers to tax bands based solely on earned income. It is also not possible to estimate changes for full-time workers only, as Revenue does not hold information on hours worked.</p>  <p>  An estimated allocation of taxpayer units into tax bands for 2023 is set out on page 2 of Revenue&rsquo;s Ready Reckoner, which is published on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/ready-reckoner.pdf. </p>  <p>  All taxpayer units who are currently liable to income tax at the higher rate would benefit from a reduction in the higher rate, such as the introduction of an intermediate 3rd rate of tax. On the assumption that the standard rate income bands remain unchanged, the number of taxpayer units who would benefit from a 30% income tax rate is estimated to be 1.07 million (33% of taxpayer units) in 2023. </p></reply>

At the same time, the sectors mentioned by the Deputy are not the only sectors that are currently facing recruitment challenges in what is fortunately a very buoyant labour market.  As such, it would in my view be potentially inequitable to single out certain sectors for particular treatment through the personal tax system. </p><p>The Home Carer Tax Credit can be claimed by couples who are married or in a civil partnership and have elected to be jointly assessed to tax, where either spouse or civil partner, the &lsquo;home carer&rsquo;, cares for one or more dependent persons. For 2022, where the home carer earns less than &euro;7,200 the full credit of &euro;1,600 can be claimed. Where the individual earns more than &euro;7,200 but less than &euro;10,400, a reduced tax credit can be claimed. The credit cannot be claimed where the home carer&rsquo;s income is &euro;10,400 or greater. As such, the home carer can undertake part-time employment, subject to the above income thresholds, and continue to avail of the Home Carer Tax Credit. </p><p>This credit was introduced in the context of the move towards individualisation, in recognition of the choices made by families where one spouse stays at home to care for children or the elderly. </p><p>The Programme for Government states that &ldquo;<i>the Home Carer Tax Credit is an effective mechanism to support couples where one decides to home parent rather than working or availing of childcare subsidies and also where one parent stays at home to meet other caring needs. It will be increased to support stay-at-home parents as we increase subsidies for childcare</i>&rdquo;.</p><p>Finally, with less than a week to go to the Budget, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on any matter that may or may not be the focus of budgetary decisions. </p></reply>

The VRT rates were changed again in Budget 2022 to increase the fiscal gap between low emission vehicles and the rest, thus incentivising motorists in the market for a new car to make &lsquo;greener choices&rsquo;. The structure is based on the 'polluter pays' principles, with a reduced rate for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) of 7% of open-market selling price (OMSP), while vehicles falling into the highest emissions band are liable to a rate of 41%.  Similarly, in motor tax, WLTP-tested vehicles are charged motor tax according to their emissions profile; the rate for BEVs is &euro;120 and scales up to &euro;2400 for the most pollutant vehicles.</p><p>Budget 2020 introduced a VRT surcharge on nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in recognition of the environmental health costs caused by pollutants emitted in particularly high quantities by diesel vehicles. Budget 2021 saw an adjustment to the NOx surcharge structure by increasing rates to incentivise the uptake of cleaner cars.</p><p>There are also a broad range of measures in support of Climate Action Plan commitments to increase the electrification of the fleet. This include a &euro;5,000 VRT relief, SEAI purchase grant, low VRT and motor tax rates, and a &euro;50,000 Benefit-in-Kind exemption for Battery Electric Vehicles. </p><p>I am satisfied that the current vehicle taxation regime is based on an environmental rationale which incentivises low emission vehicles and consequently provides strong disincentives for the most polluting ones. Officials from my Department keep vehicle taxes under review as part of the Tax Strategy Group process.</p></reply>

While historically Ireland has been a relatively cash-intensive economy, advances in technology and changing customer demands have prompted a rapid increase in the take-up of electronic payments. The Covid-19 pandemic has acted as a potential catalyst for the move towards digital payments and the move away from cash.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding a significant increase in the take-up of electronic payments, cash remains a vital part of the Irish payment system. Banks have a key role in maintaining the flow of cash through the economy and ensuring appropriate access to retail banking services for all in society, including the vulnerable. </p>  <p>  The changes currently underway in the Irish retail banking sector are a reflection of the wider challenges the banking sector is facing, not only in Ireland but also abroad. It is because of these changes that I have instructed my Department to undertake a broad-ranging review of the retail banking sector, which is currently taking place.</p>  <p>  A key part of the review will be to examine the use and availability of cash in Ireland and determine whether any legislative proposal is needed in this regard. </p>  <p>  The public consultation undertaken as part of the review contained a number of questions relating to access to cash. One of these questions noted the concerns which are being raised around access to cash and asked for submissions on what should be done to protect access to cash. </p>  <p>  My officials are currently working on the Review and their draft report will be delivered to me in November. </p></reply>

Since the beginning of the year, this Government has taken action to ease the burden for energy users, including SMEs, as much as possible. Since Budget 2022, measures of approximately &euro;2.4 billion have been introduced to ease the burden of cost of living pressures. These include a temporary reduction in excise duties charged on fuels, a temporary reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of gas and electricity, and the electricity credit of &euro;200.</p><p>However it must be acknowledged that this energy crisis affects not only Ireland but all of Europe, arising from the war in Ukraine which has led to volatility and supply constraints in energy markets. As the current inflationary environment is primarily driven by global pressures outside of our control, the Government cannot cushion businesses from the entire impact of the rising cost of energy.</p><p>It is essential that fiscal policy itself does not become part of the problem: inappropriate measures could lead to second-round effects, counterproductively adding to inflation.  Therefore, Government policy will focus on temporary and targeted measures, aimed at those most in need.</p><p>In order to directly address rising energy prices at source, the EU is rapidly negotiating a Regulation to include measures aimed at addressing windfall gains in the electricity sector and in fossil fuel production. A key element of the proposal is an infra-marginal price cap in the electricity market, designed to limit windfall revenues for producers not experiencing input cost inflation. There is a benefit to coordinated action across the EU to effectively tackle high energy prices, and my officials are working to support officials in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to progress the EU proposal.</p><p>There is a range of supports available to SMEs from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment. Along with low cost finance, their online information hub contains information to help businesses become more energy efficient. The information hub is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at: </p><p>enterprise.gov.ie/en/what-we-do/supports-for-smes/.</p><p>In the <i>Summer Economic Statement</i>, the Government adapted its budgetary strategy for next year on a once-off basis to take into account the much less benign inflationary environment. Reflecting this, <i>Budget 2023</i>will be a &lsquo;cost of living&rsquo; Budget, predominately focused on helping to ease the burden of inflation. <i>Budget 2023</i>will provide for an overall package of &euro;6.7 billion; this has been calibrated to balance the need to provide further support with the need to avoid adding to inflationary pressures. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on policy decisions in advance of Budget Day.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the six medical criteria.</p>  <p>  The Minister has no role in relation to the granting or refusal of PMCs and the HSE and the Medical Board of Appeal must be independent in their clinical determinations.</p>  <p>  Following the resignation of all members of the previous Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, effective from 30th November 2021, two Expression of Interest campaigns have been held, seeking suitable candidates for the Board. The Department of Health leads on all actions and tasks with respect to the Expression of Interest Campaigns. Department of Finance officials provide support to the Department of Health in this matter.</p>  <p>  The first campaign closed on 29th April. As there were insufficient suitable candidates arising from the first campaign, a second round was issued with a closing date of 5th July 2022. Processes to support the nomination of suitable candidates are nearing completion. Once these processes have been completed the Minister for Finance will then be in a position to appoint any suitable Department of Health nominee to the Board.  When the new Board is up and running, it will consider the best way of ensuring  outstanding appeals are addressed as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  Requests for appeal hearings can be sent to the DDMBA secretary based in the National Rehabilitation Hospital. New appeal hearing dates will be issued once the new Board is in place. Assessments for the primary medical certificate, by the HSE, are continuing to take place. </p>  <p>  In relation to the review of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme,  the Deputy will be aware, I gave a commitment to the House that such a review including a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken.</p>  <p>  In this context I have been working with Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  We consider this the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions/mobility supports for those with a disability.</p>  <p>  The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both this Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, held its first meeting on the 26th January 2022. A stock-taking exercise of existing transport and mobility schemes currently supporting people with disabilities has been completed. At its meeting of 6th September 2022 members were invited to make proposals for next steps.  These proposals will be discussed at its next meeting of 29th November 2022.</p>  <p>  As part of its contribution to the NDIS review, my  Department established an information-gathering group to capture the experiences, expertise and perspectives of former Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal (DDMBA)  members and Principal Medical Officers (PMOs) in the HSE. A range of outputs have been produced, providing information and views on the DDS scheme as inputs into the broader  review.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to engage constructively with the NDIS review with a view to assisting in  bringing  forward proposals for  Government to consider.</p>  <p>  I cannot comment on any potential changes to the scheme in advance of these proposals.</p></reply>

The data also indicates that many of the reasons given for vacancy are genuine and acceptable reasons for temporary vacancy, for example, where a property is for sale, between lettings, undergoing refurbishment, where the property is subject to a probate application or other legal proceedings, holiday homes, or in cases where the owner is in long-term care. </p><p>In Housing for All, the Government has set out a suite of incentives available to encourage re-use of properties and increase the supply of housing. However, in addition, the Government is committed to exploring options around sanctions for non-use of residential property so that there is some penalty for leaving a property vacant for a prolonged period without a genuine reason at a time where there are pressures in terms of housing supply.  As I have said on many occasions, I consider that the primary objective of a vacant residential property tax would be to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand rather than increasing tax revenues. </p><p>The Revenue analysis provides a basis for my Department to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax, and how best such a tax might be designed.  This work is well underway and I intend to bring forward proposals on a targeted measure that achieves an appropriate balance between incentivising owners of vacant habitable residential properties to bring their properties back into use, and ensuring any such tax does not arbitrarily or excessively penalise home-owners in a discriminatory way.</p><p>Regarding dereliction, I am informed by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage that the existing Derelict Sites Act imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. These powers include the power to prosecute owners who do not comply with notices served; making compulsory land purchases and carrying out necessary work at charge to the owners for the cost.</p><p>I am advised that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage continues to liaise with local authorities on the implementation of the Act with a view to improving its effectiveness. In this regard, a review of the Act was initiated in November 2021 and initial submissions have been sought from local authorities on potential improvements to the legislative provisions and the way they are applied. I am further advised that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has established a focused working group to progress this matter further. </p><p>Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, it is a long-standing practice that the Minister for Finance does not comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decision.</p></reply>

From this position of strength, and with the aid of government policies, the Irish economy proved to be remarkably resilient during successive lockdowns and emerged from the pandemic, at the start of this year, with little evidence of permanent scarring to the economy.   </p>  <p>  Our economy is now faced with new challenge and significant headwinds as a result of the war in Ukraine, the most pressing of which has been the rising cost of living. Consumer price (HICP) inflation rose to 9 per cent in August. Rising prices are eroding real incomes of Irish households and inhibiting businesses investment. The Government is acutely aware of these challenges and is committed to tackling them head-on. As part of Budget 2023 next week, the Government will set out a series of targeted once-off measures to be introduced over the course of the winter to help alleviate the cost of living pressures on both businesses and households.   </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these challenges, the economic fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong. The labour market has remained resilient, with a record number of people now in employment and the unemployment rate falling to just 4.3 per cent in August. The external side of the economy also continues to perform very strongly with particularly strong export growth in the ICT and Pharmaceutical sectors.   </p>  <p>  Whilst our economy has faced a successive wave of shocks over the last number of years, our resilience and strength ultimately comes from being a dynamic economy open to investment and trade across our borders. This has long proven to be the fundamental strength of the Irish economy, and that remains the case today.</p></reply>

The ECB is independent in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy.  </p>  <p>  The price lenders charge for their loans is a commercial matter for individual lenders. As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks or other lenders, including the interest rates they charge for mortgages and other loans.  </p>  <p>  While the general level of new lending interest rates in Ireland are currently higher than in many other European countries, recent trends indicate that the interest rates charged by lenders on new mortgages have been falling in Ireland. For example, in July 2022 &ndash; based on the latest available data from the Central Bank - the weighted average interest rate was 2.63%, which is down from 2.69% at the end of 2021 and 2.73% in July 2021. </p>  <p>  Most new mortgages in Ireland are now fixed rate mortgages and the average interest rates on these mortgages, 2.50% at the end of July, is even a little bit lower.  At the end of 2021 this was 2.59%. </p>  <p>  Over the same period, the average Eurozone new mortgage interest rate has increased and, therefore, the differential between the Irish and the Eurozone mortgage interest rate has narrowed from 1.40% at end 2021 to 0.55% at end July 2022.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the structure of the Irish mortgage market has changed over time.  For example, there has been an increase in the take up of fixed rate mortgages - in July 2022 for example, over 88% of new mortgages were at a fixed interest rate - and this will protect borrowers for an adjustment in the interest rate for the period that the interest rate is fixed.      </p>  <p>  Deputies may also wish to note that, as regulator, the Central Bank has introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders in recent years which help mortgage holders identify lower cost mortgage options.  </p>  <p>  Firstly it made changes to the Consumer Protection Code which required lenders to explain to borrowers how their non tracker variable interest rates have been set and to clearly identify the factors which may result in changes to variable interest rates.  </p>  <p>  Secondly, it also increases the level of information lenders are required to provide their customers including where there is a possibility for the borrower to move to a lower &lsquo;loan to value&rsquo; interest rate band and signpost the borrower to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  Also, by considering and availing of the options available on the market, some borrowers may be able to reduce their mortgage costs. A 2020 Central Bank study estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining mortgage term.</p>  <p>  The change in the Irish mortgage market to a greater proportion of fixed rate mortgages along with changes to the Consumer Protection Code outlined above will help mortgage holders manage the impact of rising ECB interest rates.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the CCMA was introduced to ensure that regulated entities have fair and transparent processes in place for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears and is part of the national policy framework of supports and protections available to assist borrowers in financial difficulties. </p>  <p>  The CCMA sets out the process that entities must follow when a borrower is in or facing difficulties with their mortgage payments. Due regard must be given to the fact that each case is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the regulated entity, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her mortgage obligations. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank has made its expectations to lenders clear on how firms should engage with borrowers who are in long-term mortgage arrears. Lenders should seek to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to borrowers. Nevertheless, borrowers who have not engaged with the processes laid out under the CCMA, risk loss of ownership. </p>  <p>  That being said, there is an obligation on regulated entities to explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements (ARAs) offered by that entity, in order to determine which ARA, if any, is appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances. Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an ARA with the borrower and other clear requirements are met, or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.</p>  <p>  The CCMA also provides for an appeals mechanism, including where the entity declines to offer an ARA, where the borrower is not willing to enter into an ARA offered, or where the entity classifies the borrower as not co-operating.</p></reply>

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment up to a maximum of &euro;1,250 (&euro;1,500 in the case of e-bikes), for an employee to use, in whole or in part, to travel to work. Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers.</p><p>From 1 August 2020, this exemption was increased from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,250 for expenditure incurred by an employer in connection with the provision of a bicycle and/or bicycle safety equipment in respect of any one employee. A higher exemption limit of &euro;1,500 applies in the case of the provision of an electric bike (which may also include bicycle safety equipment). These increases and the change to a 4-year period from a 5-year period were in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government.</p><p>It is assumed that the reference to &ldquo;cargo bikes&rdquo; by the Deputy means a bicycle specifically designed to carry a load. Such a bicycle would qualify under the cycle to work scheme, assuming all of the required conditions are satisfied.</p><p>Benefit-in-kind is a charge to tax that applies where an employer provides an employee with a benefit such as a bicycle, car or accommodation. Therefore, the Cycle to Work scheme is only applicable where the bicycle and safety equipment is provided by an employer to either a director or someone in its employment and thus, where an employer-employee relationship does not exist, for example, in the case of self-employed, retired individuals, or those in receipt of social welfare payments, such individuals can&rsquo;t qualify for the scheme. </p><p>The scheme continues to be kept under review by my officials and any extension to the scheme of increase in the allowance would create an additional cost and that cost must be recovered elsewhere. The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment at this time, on what changes, if any, are being considered in terms of this relief or any other tax relief. The Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Transport published an examination of the scheme in November 2021 as part of the Spending Review series.</p><p>Further guidance regarding the Cycle to Work Scheme can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

The terms of reference for the Commission members were broad and comprehensive. The Commission was asked to independently consider how best the taxation and welfare systems can support economic activity, and promote increased employment and prosperity while ensuring that there are sufficient resources available to meet the costs of the public services and supports in the medium and longer term.</p>  <p>  The Commission was called on to consider some specific policy matters including reforms to the social insurance system, how the taxation system can support the transition to a low carbon economy, and the role of the tax and welfare systems in achieving housing policy objectives; all while taking account of relevant issues such as the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic, aging demographics, and digital disruption and automation. Furthermore, the Commission was asked to review how best the taxation environment for SMEs and entrepreneurs can ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to sustain and grow an existing business or to start and scale up a new business.</p>  <p>  These terms of reference were drafted in accordance with the principles of taxation and welfare policy outlined within the 2020 Programme for Government. This includes the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a pro-enterprise policy framework and to providing a stable and sustainable regulatory and tax environment.  </p>  <p>  An independent review of this nature complies with best practice and is important to ensure that the taxation and welfare system remains fit for purpose into the medium to long term.</p>  <p>  'Foundations for the Future&rsquo;, the Report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, is a wide ranging report that contains over 500 pages and 116 recommendations. This includes a number of recommendations related to supporting economic activity and the tax environment for SMEs and entrepreneurs in particular.</p>  <p>  It is important to allow time for detailed consideration of these serious recommendations. It is my intention to provide an initial response to some of the recommendations as part of the upcoming budget. The medium to long-term focused recommendations will also serve to inform this and future governments&rsquo; deliberations on these important challenges for many years to come.</p></reply>

The Roadmap set out the need to promote long-term pension saving to address income adequacy in retirement, in particular for low income earners.</p><p>The IDPRTG is chaired by the Department of Finance, and includes representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; the Department of Social Protection (DSP); the Office of the Revenue Commissioners; and the Pensions Authority. In 2020 the IDPRTG published a report which set out a number of actions to aid in the harmonisation and simplification of supplemental pensions.</p><p>Finance Act 2021 introduced a package of measures to give effect to some of the actions set out in the group&rsquo;s report. These included the removal of a prohibition of transfers from an occupational pension scheme to a Personal Retirement Savings Account for members with more than 15 years&rsquo; service; the abolition of the Approved Minimum Retirement Fund; and the extension of an Approved Retirement Fund option to death-in-service benefits.</p><p>The Group continues its work to implement the actions set out in the Group's Report. Accordingly, a number of proposals from the 2020 Report are currently being worked on, some of which are technical in nature and others which have wider policy implications necessitating careful consideration through the normal policy channels. One of these actions, designed to aid in the harmonisation and simplification of supplemental pensions, is:</p><p><i>&lsquo;The differential treatment of the PRSA for funding purposes should be abolished, employer contributions to PRSAs should not be subject to BIK.&rsquo;</i></p><p>As indicated in this year&rsquo;s Tax Strategy Group paper www.gov.ie/en/collection/d5b41-budget-2023-tax-strategy-group-papers/ one of the pension policy issues actively being considered is to abolish the differential treatment of the PRSAs for funding purposes.</p><p>The IDPRTG focused closely on this issue during the course of 2022 and they are examining a number of methods that could be used to achieve equalisation of the funding options for occupational pension schemes and PRSAs. </p><p>However, as the Deputy will be aware, it is a long-standing practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions or the Finance Bill.</p></reply>

This information included whether the properties were unoccupied at 1 November 2021, the reason why and whether they (the properties) had been vacant for 12 months or more. Vacancy data on LPT returns has not been verified by Revenue and was collected for informational purposes only. A preliminary analysis of this data was published by Revenue on 6 July 2022, and is available at: </p><p>www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/local-property-tax/lpt-stats-2022/index.aspx.</p><p>The preliminary analysis published by Revenue includes a breakdown of the various reasons provided for vacancy. It indicates that the most frequent reasons for properties reported as vacant, were &ldquo;Undergoing Refurbishment&rdquo; (22.2%), &ldquo;Other&rdquo; (21.7%) and &ldquo;Holiday Home&rdquo; (20.4%). Other reasons for vacancy were reported as a property being for sale or between lettings, subject to a probate application or other legal proceedings, or where the owner is in long-term care. The analysis also indicated that levels of vacancy among LPT liable properties are low across all counties and lie within a range that is considered to be in line with a normal functioning housing market.</p><p>As I have said on many occasions, I consider that the primary objective of a vacant residential property tax would be to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand rather than increasing tax revenues. The Revenue analysis provides a basis for my Department to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax, and how best such a tax might be designed. </p><p>This work is well underway and I intend to bring forward proposals on a targeted measure that achieves an appropriate balance between incentivising owners of vacant habitable residential properties to bring their properties back into use, and ensuring any such tax does not arbitrarily or excessively penalise home-owners for normal temporary vacancy. As the Deputy will be aware, it is a long-standing practice that the Minister for Finance does not comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.</p></reply>

In effect, this has resulted in a transfer of domestic incomes from net energy importing countries to net energy exporting countries, leading to a deterioration in the current account balance in a number of Member States. </p>  <p>  The latest euro area current account data are for the first quarter of the year, so only capture the initial impact of rising energy prices on foot of the onset of the war in Ukraine. The ECB data show the euro area current account surplus at &euro;217 billion (1.7 per cent of euro area GDP) in the first quarter, down from &euro;301 billion (2.6 per cent of euro area GDP) a year earlier. </p>  <p>  The latest ECB macroeconomic projections point to a continued deterioration in the euro area terms of trade and trade balance due to rising energy prices. For the euro area, the ECB forecast a current account deficit 0.3 per cent of GDP in 2022 and 0.5 per cent of GDP in 2023. The balance becomes positive in 2024 with a current account surplus of 0.1 per cent of GDP. In contrast, while Ireland&rsquo;s surplus is expected to moderate over the coming years, it is still expected to remain in surplus over the medium-term.</p>  <p>  Close monitoring and coordination of the broad range of fiscal and financial policies in the euro area is essential. Implementing effective, sustainable policies in a concerted manner to mitigate the impact of the war on the euro area economy and support the recovery requires intense policy dialogue and coordination. As such, the Finance Ministers of the euro area are intervening to support vulnerable households and businesses in facing this unprecedented price shock. </p>  <p>  We have two priorities in our collective response. Firstly, policy interventions should focus on income transfers that are exceptional and, where possible, temporary and targeted. We will aim to avoid competitive tax reductions within the euro area. Secondly, we commit to avoiding a wage-price &lsquo;spiral&rsquo;. Similarly, super levels of profitability should not be enjoyed by some while many are suffering the economic consequences of war. We stand ready to coordinate closely and look forward to the Commission proposals in this regard. </p>  <p>  In this context, the Eurogroup is committed to regular discussions on macro-economic developments and policy prospects, including rising inflation and energy prices.

It was asked to independently consider how best the taxation and welfare systems can support economic activity, and promote increased employment and prosperity while ensuring that there are sufficient resources available to meet the costs of the public services and supports in the medium and longer term.</p>  <p>  &lsquo;Foundations for the Future&rsquo;, the Report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, was published on 14 September. It is a wide ranging report that contains over 500 pages and 116 recommendations relating to the future of our taxation and welfare systems. It is available to download at the following link: gov.ie - Report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare (www.gov.ie).</p>  <p>  The report poses serious questions that we as a society must carefully consider. The recommendations will foster real debate around how we reform our tax and welfare systems over the longer term in order to safeguard their sustainability and adapt to a rapidly changing environment. This important work is focused on the longer term and will contribute to debates on the optimal balance of taxation for many years to come.</p>  <p>  It is clearly set out in the Commission&rsquo;s report that the recommendations are not intended to be implemented all at once, but rather provide a direction of travel for this and future Governments around how the sustainability of the taxation and welfare systems may be improved in a fair and equitable manner.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s recommendations, including those concerning wealth and capital taxes, are significant and wide ranging, and it is important to allow time for detailed consideration. As is acknowledged in the report, the recommendations come at a challenging time economically.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to provide an initial response to some of the Reports recommendations as part of the upcoming budget and over the medium term my Department will consider the recommendations of the Report in detail. </p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to speculate on what specific elements of the report I might act on in advance of that process which will be concluding over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).</p><p>Nevertheless, this Government understands that insurance costs are a significant issue for customers, and has therefore prioritised reform of this sector through the whole-of-Government <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform.</i>Delivery of the reform package is overseen by the Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, which is chaired by An T&aacute;naiste, and contains a number of Ministers as standing members. Work is underway to complete the delivery of the remaining actions, with some 80 per cent of delivered at the time of the last implementation report in March.</p><p>It is the Government&rsquo;s expectation that all savings from this reform agenda are passed onto customers, including any reduction in claims costs resulting from the new <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines</i>. The Guidelines represent a milestone in the insurance reform agenda, and have significantly lowered award levels for many common injuries, with recent data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board indicating that the overall average award has fallen by 42 per cent compared to awards made in 2020 under the Book of Quantum. </p><p>The Guidelines are therefore expected to lead to a reduction in the overall cost of claims, including legal fees. It is necessary for the insurance industry to pass on any benefits from this initiative, and the many other reform already introduced, to its hard-pressed customers, especially in the context of current inflationary pressures. </p><p>Both Minister Donohoe and I have been clear on these points and remain committed to holding the insurance sector to account, in so far as it is permissible, on commitments made. In this regard, I will be meeting with the CEOs of the eight main insurers in the Irish market again in the coming weeks in order to further assess their response to the Action Plan reforms, and to stress the importance of reflecting lower claims costs through reduced premiums. I will also continue to press insurers on the need to expand their risk appetite, especially into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover.</p><p>In addition, the National Claims Information Database (NCID), managed by the Central Bank of Ireland, contains official data on premiums and claims costs, and provides further evidence on the Irish insurance market. </p><p>Over time, this allows policymakers and stakeholders to assess the cumulative impact of this multi-action reform package. Following the implementation of the <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines</i>, the Central Bank has amended the NCID data specification and will collect further claim settlement data. The fourth NCID Private Motor Report, which will provide data up to the end of 2021, should show some initial insight into the impact of the Guidelines, and I look forward to the publication of this report in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Almost every advanced economy in the world is in the same position, with inflation rates of 8.3 and 9.1 per cent recorded in the US and euro area respectively in August.</p><p>The key driver of the elevated level of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy, food and other commodity prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine. However, as highlighted in the correspondence, pass-through price effects from higher energy prices are increasingly being felt in other sectors. Indeed, non-energy or &lsquo;core&rsquo; inflation has picked up sharply in recent months and stood at 6.2 per cent in August, suggesting inflationary pressures are increasingly broad based.</p><p>The Government recognises the impact rising prices have had on households and businesses across the country and has taken significant action. Some &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures has been announced since last October. Looking ahead, the Government will continue to address these challenges head on. <i>Budget 2023</i>will be a &lsquo;Cost of Living Budget&rsquo; and will build on the fiscal supports the Government has already provided to cushion the impact of rising prices.</p><p>The Government supported households and firms through the pandemic and will continue to do so in the face of unprecedented energy price spikes caused by Putin&rsquo;s war. However, we must be cognisant that resources are limited and the Government has to balance the appropriate response to the increased cost of living in Ireland with the very high level of global economic uncertainty and macroeconomic risk. </p><p>Furthermore, in calibrating how we respond to the current challenges, it is important that we strike the right balance and ensure that policy doesn&rsquo;t inadvertently add further inflationary pressures into the system.</p></reply>

The rate was introduced by Financial Resolution on 19 May 2021 and is provided for by section 31E of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999. It applies where a person buys 10 or more residential properties, excluding apartments, in any 12-month period. The background to the introduction of the measure was the purchase by institutional investors of all, or a significant proportion of, residential housing estates, thus denying first-time and other buyers an opportunity to purchase a home. The 10% rate is intended to provide a significant disincentive to this practice.</p>  <p>  To ensure that the higher rate of duty does not have an adverse impact on the delivery of social and affordable housing in the State, section 31E contains a specific exemption from the 10% rate of duty for residential units that are leased to a local authority for onward leasing to a household that qualifies for social housing support. The relief is intended to apply in respect of residential units acquired under the &lsquo;mortgage-to-rent&rsquo; scheme. I have also introduced two specific repayment schemes in relation to section 31E, which are provided for by sections 83E and section 83F of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.</p>  <p>  Section 83E, which was introduced by the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021, provides for a partial repayment of stamp duty paid at the higher 10% rate where, within 2 years of acquisition, a property is leased to a local authority or an approved housing body for the purpose of social housing. Section 83F, which was introduced by the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022, provides for a partial repayment where, within 6 months of acquisition, a property is designated as a &ldquo;cost rental dwelling&rdquo;. In the case of both schemes, the amount to be repaid is the difference between the amount of stamp duty paid at the higher 10% rate and the amount of duty that would have been payable had the standard rate applied. </p>  <p>  It has subsequently come to my attention that Section 31E may impact on a number of other forms of acquisition that it was not intended to apply to, and I will consider introducing similar measures to remove that impact where a convincing case for doing so is presented to me.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give any indication of any plans I may have in this regard, be they for Budget 2023 before it is announced, or Finance Bill 2022 in advance of its publication. </p></reply>

Decisions in this regard, including AIB's original announcement on 19 July 2022 to re-purpose 70 of its branches across the country, are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis.

This framework, which is publicly available, was insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  Papers made available to the Department of Finance via a secure web-link in advance of the June AIB Board Meeting included a proposal on a reconfiguration of some AIB branches but with no firm announcement date. Department officials do not attend board meetings for any of the banks in which the state has a shareholding.</p>  <p>  A Department of Finance official met with AIB officials on 15 July 2022 where he was advised that an announcement of branch reconfiguration would be made on 19 July 2022.

This is why my Department conducts the SME Credit Demand Survey and has been doing so biannually since 2011. The SME Credit Demand survey is an independent and statistically significant report that provides insights into the availability of, demand for credit and related issues amongst SMEs. In addition, the report is an important resource used for research by my Department in conjunction with the Central Bank, ESRI and others.  </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the latest SME Credit Demand Survey was published on the 5 September 2022 and the full report is available on www.gov.ie. </p><p>The results show that demand for bank credit has fallen steadily since the series commenced, with requests in the period falling from 39% of those surveyed in September 2012 to 16% in the most recent result (6 months to March 2022).  The recent growth in non-bank finance activity as a source of credit for SMEs is an important contributing factor which is why a new question was introduced in the recent survey specifically in relation to demand for non-bank finance in its own right. </p><p>The 5% of SMEs who stated they applied for non-bank finance in the 6 months to March 2022 is notable and reflects a growing market share for this source of finance. </p><p>Of those SMEs who did not apply for bank finance the main stated reason was a lack of credit requirements due to sufficient internal funds, a reason cited by 76% of businesses not seeking credit (up from 72% in March 2021). Of those companies that have requested bank credit, expansion needs (42%) was the main reason for finance requests up from 32% in March 2021. Notably, expected future demand remains stable with 12% of SMEs expecting to apply for finance in the following six months, down from 13% during the corresponding period in 2021.</p><p>Despite ongoing uncertainty, SMEs have remained resilient with all sectors reporting an improvement in turnover performance compared to March 2021. With 45% of all businesses reported increased turnover in the six months up to March 2022 and 18% reporting a decrease. This is a significant improvement from the low levels recorded in March 2021. </p><p>Notably the biggest improvement seen was in the Hotel and Restaurant Sector with 66% reporting improved turnover. In addition, 61% of SMEs reported an increase in profit during 2022, compared to 53% in 2021. These positive financial results indicate SMEs are bouncing back to pre-pandemic profit levels. However, this resilience is being tested further with rising energy costs. </p><p>Government remains committed to supporting the business community through these challenging times and it will continue to monitor access to credit and related issues through <i>inter alia</i>my Department&rsquo;s SME Credit Demand Survey.  </p></reply>

We now have more people employed in our country than ever before, while the quarterly unemployment rate stands at 4.4% - levels not seen since 2005.</p>  <p>  It is especially welcome to see a strong recovery in the Accommodation and Food Service sector, with employment in this sector increasing by 40% in the past 12 months. In Q2 2022 employment had increased to 168,200; this consisted of 50,300 working in the accommodation sub-sector and 117,900 work in the Food and Beverage Service activities sub-sector. 57 percent of those working in the sector are female.</p>  <p>  The impact of the pandemic was not equal across sectors, and those in the Hospitality sector was significantly affected. Our strong policy interventions during the pandemic &ndash; rapidly rolling out the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and Pandemic Unemployment Payment &ndash; appear to have minimised any long-term labour market scarring in the sector.</p>  <p>  The increase in employment was also supported by the approval of employment permits for the sector. Since the start of May, 1,345 applications for Chefs have been processed by my Department. 30 permits for hotel and accommodation managers have also been issued, out of an available 350 in the quota announced in October 2021, with a further 11 awaiting processing.</p>  <p>  Of those Ukrainians who have arrived under the protection of the EU&rsquo;s Temporary Protection Directive, over 4,000 have also been integrated into roles in the Accommodation and Food sector.</p>  <p>  Through EURES Ireland, which is managed by the Department of Social Protection, Irish hospitality opportunities have been a focus of EU recruitment events, and the EURES Ireland team have been working closely with Spain in particular in seeking to recruit for vacancies in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Intreo, the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s public employment services have continued ongoing engagement the restaurant and hospitality sector. Intreo provides a range of supports to employers looking to recruit staff. Employers can register their vacancies for free on Jobsireland.ie. Intreo have a dedicated Employer Engagement team. They support in promoting vacancies through a range of networks and via the JobsIreland platform. They can also match jobseekers to suitable vacancies. Intreo also supports training providers to recruit jobseekers to training opportunities.</p>  <p>  Over the past eight months, the Employer Relations Division of Intreo has handled almost 1,800 vacancies, 850 promotions of training and recruitment opportunities and placed almost 460 in relevant training for the accommodation and food sector.  This is in addition to direct referrals by Activation Case Officers who are working with jobseeking clients.  </p>  <p>Intreo is currently rolling out a recruitment campaign nationally to target jobseekers and those who are inactive in the labour force. The #ReturnToWork campaign from 26th September to 7th October includes some 30 job and training fairs across the country to assist over 70 employers across a number of sectors, including the accommodation and food sector, to meet with people who are seeking to return to work.  Details of the vacancies will be published on the Department&rsquo;s free job matching platform www.jobsireland.ie and detail of all the events will be posted on the What&rsquo;s On section of the website, supported by a social media campaign to promote awareness of the events planned over the two weeks. </p>  <p>  Sustaining further increases in the hospitality workforce, however, will ultimately depend on the sector addressing its long-standing workforce recruitment and retention issues, which pre-date the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group, chaired by F&aacute;ilte Ireland under the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, is working to support these sectors in driving their long-term repositioning as appealing and rewarding career choices and ensure a future pipeline of talent.</p>  <p>  In terms of rising costs, I recently met with stakeholders, including the Restaurants Association of Ireland, through the Tourism and Hospitality Forum, where the sector outlined their issues and the measures they feel are necessary to address these.</p>  <p>  I think it is fair to say that this Government has not been found wanting when it has come to helping businesses get through difficult periods. The multibillion euro financial assistance provided by Government during the pandemic was unprecedented, whether it was help with businesses&rsquo; wage bill so they could keep staff on, their overheads, the introduction of a cheaper, easier way to restructure and survive than examinership; the commercial rates waiver, or the reduction in VAT for the hospitality sector.</p>  <p>  In relation to energy costs, the Government has already implemented measures to help ease the impact on enterprises, including a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged, by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel, and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil.</p>  <p>  We are working on new proposals to help businesses with rapidly rising energy prices and I hope to be able to make a positive announcement about that in the Budget.  </p>  <p>  We&rsquo;ll also be looking to raise awareness around energy efficiency, helping businesses reduce the amount of energy they use in the first place and improving take-up of the approximately 20 different schemes we already have in place for business.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them.  </p><p>In relation to the issue of trial shifts, I would point out that there is no exemption under employment rights legislation, including the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, for such work trials. All hours worked, including those on trial, must be paid at the minimum wage or above. People on work trials are also covered by the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Acts 2005 &ndash; 2014, which provide for safe working conditions as well as the Employment Equality Acts 1998 -2015, which provides against discrimination or harassment. </p><p>The right to receive the minimum wage cannot be waived in a contract as any provision in an agreement to do so is void as a matter of law.  Failure to pay the national minimum hourly rate of pay is a criminal offence, punishable upon summary conviction, by a fine not exceeding &euro;2,500 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months or both. </p></reply>

Outline proposals were discussed and the Council of Energy Ministers invited the European Commission to make formal proposals.</p><p>On 14 September the European Commission published a proposed regulation which includes measures aimed at addressing windfall gains in the electricity sector and in fossil fuel production. This proposal is expected to raise additional revenues which will be used to reduce the cost of energy for households and businesses. My Department is currently working to clarify various aspects of the proposal, following which it should be possible to provide estimates of expected revenues.</p><p>It is important that this proposal captures the windfall gains and minimises negative impacts on consumers. The proposal will be negotiated throughout the remainder of this month with a view to being approved at a meeting of the Council of Energy Ministers on 30 September. I fully support the objectives of this proposal and am working to ensure it fully addresses the issues of windfall gains in Ireland.</p></reply>

Outline proposals were discussed and the Council of Energy Ministers invited the European Commission to make formal proposals.</p><p>On 14 September the European Commission published a proposed regulation which includes measures aimed at addressing windfall gains in the electricity sector and in fossil fuel production. This proposal is expected to raise additional revenues which will be used to reduce the cost of energy for households and businesses. My Department is currently working to clarify various aspects of the proposal, following which it should be possible to provide estimates of expected revenues.</p><p>It is important that this proposal captures the windfall gains and minimises negative impacts on consumers. The proposal will be negotiated throughout the remainder of this month with a view to being approved at a meeting of the Council of Energy Ministers on 30 September. I fully support the objectives of this proposal and am working to ensure it fully addresses the issues of windfall gains in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Framework, which was published last April, highlights the need to implement this department&rsquo;s Sustainable Mobility Policy (SMP) as a priority, and to devise a programme of measures for the transport sector to increase energy efficiency and reduce reliance on fossil fuels with particular reference to the International Energy Agency&rsquo;s (IEA) <i>10-Point Plan to Cut Oil Use</i>.  </p><p>As the Deputy may know, the SMP aims to support a significant shift from car use towards more sustainable modes &ndash; walking, cycling and public transport - between now and 2030.  Within the current crisis, this approach is being supported by reduced public transport fares and a significant increase in investment in active travel infrastructure.  </p><p>Information campaigns, which focus on the benefits of sustainable modes &ndash; reduced costs, emissions reductions, improved health &ndash; also have the potential to realise considerable energy savings.  As demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, a campaign of clear targeted messaging is one of the most effective ways to achieve significant behavioural change in a short timeframe. </p><p>In the context of the current crisis, my department will continue to engage on sector-specific and Government-wide communications initiatives to encourage individuals and businesses to lower their fuel usage where feasible, including the <i>Reduce Your Use</i>campaign being coordinated by the Department of the Environment, Climate, and Communications (DECC).</p></reply>

However, my Department has completed research and pilot programmes, which have informed our bus and rail fleet procurement and will help contribute to phasing out the use of fossil-fuels in public transport networks across the country.</p>  <p>  Between 2018 and 2022, my department evaluated a range of alternative fuels and technologies to inform future public service obligation (PSO) bus procurement. The trials, which reproduced real-world test conditions along modified urban bus routes in Dublin and Cork, found that battery-electric buses are the most efficient technology for Ireland&rsquo;s urban bus routes. The final report was published on 23 May 2022 (available from: www.gov.ie/en/publication/e2cd8-low-emission-bus-trial-final-report/).</p>  <p>  In collaboration with the National Transport Authority, my department has also made significant progress in the procurement of low-emission buses to help reduce fossil-fuel energy use in transport. The NTA has introduced 119 hybrid-electric buses into service, and has also signed a framework agreement for the order of eight hundred battery-electric double-deck buses, with an order for 120 buses placed on 13 June 2022.</p>  <p>  While intercity rail electrification is unlikely in the short- to medium-term, the DART+ programme will deliver a doubling of existing DART capacity and tripling of the amount of electrified track. Ninety-five battery-electric rail units are expected to enter service in 2025, and the DART+ programme will extend and enhance the current DART system in the Greater Dublin Area.</p>  <p>  In line with the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement and Climate Action Plan 2021, my department has also set an indicative trajectory for the use of biofuels in transport, with an approximate blend of E10 (up to 10% by volume bioethanol blend in petrol) and B20 (up to 20% biodiesel blended into diesel) expected by 2030, with an interim target of E10/B12 (up to 12% biodiesel) by 2025. The blending obligation, which currently applies to road transport, will be expanded to the rail sector from 2024. My department will shortly be publishing a summary report on renewable transport fuel policy implementation, which will include consideration of the opportunities and challenges in relation to providing further indigenous supply of renewable fuels in transport, and research on the sustainability and availability of renewable transport fuels.</p></reply>

As part of the national remote working strategy: Making Remote Work, in 2021 the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) reviewed the tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers. The paper is published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The TSG paper noted that changes to the tax arrangements for remote working may give rise to issues of deadweight loss and economic inefficiencies, as well as equity issues in the personal income tax system. The paper also noted that in the context of a whole of Government policy to facilitate and support remote working, it may be considered appropriate to enhance or amend the current tax arrangements in order to underline and reinforce public policy decisions in this area.</p>  <p>  Taking these factors into consideration, as announced in Budget 2022, the tax arrangements for remote working were enhanced and formalised in line with Government policy to facilitate and support remote working.  Accordingly, for the tax year 2022, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heat and broadband in respect of those days spent working from home can be claimed by taxpayers.</p>  <p>  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate. However, this measure provides some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home, and at the same time it ensures that the traditional burden of employer related costs are not transferred from the employer to the State and the wider body of taxpayers.  In addition, I would point out that, as the current deduction relates to a proportion of the cost of the relevant expenses, the amount that may be claimed will increase as those expenses increase. </p>  <p>  There are no immediate plans to further increase the tax relief for working from home.</p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of living increases, the Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden. On a cumulative basis to-date, the Government has announced approximately &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures since last October.  These measures include changes in tax and social welfare, the provision of an energy credit for households and a temporary reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of certain energy products.</p></reply>

Almost every advanced economy in the world is in the same position, with euro area inflation reaching a record 9.1 per cent in August.</p>  <p>  The key driver of the elevated level of inflation at present is the sharp rise in wholesale energy, food and other commodity prices since the onset of the war in Ukraine. As highlighted in the correspondence, pass-through price effects from higher energy prices are increasingly being felt in other sectors including food (via higher energy inputs). Indeed, the recent rise in non-energy or &lsquo;core&rsquo; inflation, which stood at 5.8 per cent in August, suggests inflationary pressures are becoming increasingly broad-based.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the impact this has had on households and businesses across the country, and has taken significant action. Some &euro;2&frac12; billion in cost of living measures have been announced since last October.</p>  <p>  The government is committed to tackling the cost of living challenges head on and the forthcoming Budget will set out further supports to help alleviate the inflationary pressures on society. In doing so we must strike a balance between protecting the most vulnerable households and firms from a once-in-a-generation energy price shock, while at the same time ensuring that policy doesn&rsquo;t added to the inflationary cycle.</p>  <p>  However, we must be cognisant that resources are limited and the Government has to balance the appropriate response to the increased cost of living in Ireland with the unprecedented level of global economic uncertainty and macroeconomic risk.</p></reply>

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment up to a maximum of &euro;1,250 (&euro;1,500 in the case of e-bikes), for an employee to use, in whole or in part, to travel to work. Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers.</p>  <p>  From 1 August 2020, this exemption was increased from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,250 for expenditure incurred by an employer in connection with the provision of a bicycle and/or bicycle safety equipment in respect of any one employee. A higher exemption limit of &euro;1,500 applies in the case of the provision of an electric bike (which may also include bicycle safety equipment). These increases and the change to a 4-year period from a 5-year period were in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The Cycle to Work scheme operates on a self-administration basis. Relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of its particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation.  As the Deputy has noted, one of the conditions of the scheme is that the bicycle and safety equipment must be unused and not second-hand.  The Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Transport published an examination of the scheme in November 2021 as part of the Spending Review series. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment at this time, on what changes, if any, are being considered in terms of this relief or any other tax relief.</p></reply>

Accordingly, for the tax year 2022, Remote Working Relief provides an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heat and broadband in respect of those days spent working from home can be claimed by taxpayers.</p>  <p>  Remote Working Relief claims can be made via Revenue&rsquo;s MyAccount, for years up to and including 2022. If making a claim for 2022, in real-time, the taxpayer is required to upload a readable image of his or her receipt(s) to Revenue&rsquo;s Receipts Tracker during the application and the amount claimed increases the taxpayer&rsquo;s current year tax credits for which he or she will see a benefit in his or her next payroll payment. For previous years, 2018 to 2021, the claim for remote working relief is made through the taxpayer&rsquo;s income tax return, which can also be made through MyAccount.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows employers to pay a tax-free amount of &euro;3.20 per day to employees who work remotely and satisfy certain conditions. It should be noted that any amounts paid exceeding the &euro;3.20 daily rate are subject to tax, PRSI and USC in the normal manner.</p>  <p>  There is no legal obligation on the employer to make such a payment and the choice of whether to make the payment of &euro;3.20 is at the discretion of the employer. If the employer does not make a payment of &euro;3.20 per day, (or pays less than &euro;3.20 per day) Remote Working Relief can be claimed, deducting any payment made by the employer.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue has published detailed guidance on this matter on their website, with comprehensive information available in Tax and Duty Manual 05-02-13 e-Working and Tax, which is available at www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-05/05-02-13.pdf</p></reply>

The war in Ukraine has led to volatility in energy markets and exacerbated supply constraints in the electricity market. I am well aware of the difficulties Irish households and businesses are going through arising from substantial increases in energy bills.</p>  <p>  It is clear the increase in energy prices is leading to windfall gains for some energy companies across Europe, particularly those involved in the production of fossil fuels and those producing energy using technologies that are not dependent on gas. Where such producers sell at the current market price, they benefit from the market price inflation but without suffering any significant increase in their production costs. My officials have been working with the Department of the Environment, Climate, and Communications to attempt to quantify such gains, and to explore the potential of collecting a portion of these windfall gains to provide support to energy consumers during these difficult times.</p>  <p>  Work in this regard is now focusing on a proposed European Commission Regulation which is under rapid negotiation. Gains to electricity producers are driven by the market structure, which determines the marginal price paid for each unit of electricity sold. For this reason, the EU Regulation proposes to include an infra-marginal price cap in the electricity market, designed to limit windfall revenues for producers that are not experiencing input cost inflation. The Regulation also includes a proposed solidarity contribution from fossil fuel producers. The proposal will be negotiated throughout the remainder of this month with a view to being approved at a meeting of the Council of Energy Ministers on 30 September. I fully support the objectives of this proposal.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has referenced discussions at Eurogroup and I can confirm that, since last October, the Eurogroup has regularly discussed energy prices and inflation. Euro area Finance Ministers have worked to coordinate policy measures so as to continue to drive the energy transition to more sustainable sources, while also targeting Government supports towards the most vulnerable. At our most recent Eurogroup meeting on 9th September last, we agreed to work with businesses and workers to avoid a wage-price spiral, and also agreed that supernormal levels of profitability should not be experienced by some while so many are suffering the economic consequences of a war.</p></reply>

In some cases, Revenue may ask the claimant to provide additional supporting documentation to prove his or her entitlement to the credit. </p>  <p>  Where a doctor certifies that a child was incapacitated for earlier periods, a claimant may be entitled to receive the credit for those earlier years of assessment. This is, however, subject to the &lsquo;four-year rule&rsquo; provided for by section 865 TCA 1997.</p>  <p>  Section 865 TCA 1997 provides a general right to repayment of tax where a person has paid tax which is not due, however subsection (4) sets out that that right is subject to the making of a claim within a statutory limit of four years after the end of the chargeable period to which the claim relates. That statutory limit is binding on Revenue as well as on taxpayers. Determinations of the Tax Appeals Commission in differing appellant circumstances confirm that there is no discretion in the application of the four-year rule for claiming repayments.</p>  <p>  Section 865 was introduced in 2003 and provides a statutory general right to repayment of tax as well as payment of interest, subject to the four-year time limit.  It provides that no repayment may be made based on claims submitted more than four years after the end of the chargeable period to which they relate.  Prior to its introduction there was no statutory right to repayment, though a taxpayer could sue for repayment under common law.  The Minister for Finance at that time indicated that, in introducing the new arrangements, he was satisfied that they achieved the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers while providing necessary protection for the Exchequer. I am satisfied that that continues to be the position.</p>  <p>  When section 865 was introduced, Revenue&rsquo;s general right to raise assessments or make enquiries in relation to taxpayer returns was also reduced to four years, although in certain circumstances, for example where fraud or neglect is suspected or in the context of the application of general anti-avoidance rules, Revenue's right to raise assessments or make enquiries is not time limited.  Previously, the general time limit on the raising of assessments by Revenue had been ten years. The provision of a four-year time limit for Revenue raising assessments and making enquiries and for taxpayers to claim a repayment of tax creates parity between both positions.  An increase in one limit would have to be considered in the context of corresponding increases in other time limits in order to preserve that parity.</p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to amend the four-year limit in section 865.</p>  <p>  Further information in relation to the ICTC can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website or in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-05, both of which may be found at the links below:</p>  <p>- Revenue website: www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/children/incapacitated-child-credit/index.aspx  </p>  <p>  - Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-05: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-05.pdf.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s ability to attract and retain FDI reflects our strong legal and regulatory landscape, our track record as a stable and pro-enterprise jurisdiction, and our talented and flexible workforce. These unique features continue to support our competitive advantages, which are recognised and valued by the multinational sector.</p>  <p>  While large parts of the domestic economy were shut down during the Covid-19 pandemic, the resilience of the multinational sector proved remarkable, with the sector supporting the economy during the worst of the crisis and helped to bolster Ireland&rsquo;s transition from the pandemic. Whilst the outlook in the domestic economy improved somewhat as restrictions were lifted at the beginning of this year, the onset of the war in Ukraine fundamentally altered the economic outlook, representing a large supply-side shock to the global economy. </p>  <p>  The primary channel through which the conflict has impacted the Irish economy is via elevated energy and other commodity prices. Higher prices have undermined the profitability of business, with costs rising in both the Irish manufacturing and services sectors. However, higher inflation is not only affecting the competitiveness of businesses in Ireland, but is also impacting on the competitiveness of businesses in most advanced economies, with the euro area, the US, and the UK all recording inflation levels of at least 9 per cent in August.</p>  <p>  Fortunately, Ireland has entered this period of uncertainty in a position of strength. The Irish modified current account, which strips out the distorting effects of globalisation, is in a strong position and is expected to remain in surplus over the medium term. Irish exports have recorded a robust first half of 2022, with a continued strong performance in the multinational sector and significant growth in the traditional sector. However, we cannot become complacent and I am very aware of the importance of maintaining our competitive position on the international stage.</p>  <p>  Domestically, there is a real risk that a wage-price spiral emerges as a result of persistently-high inflation. This would damage our cost competitiveness and hamper the economy&rsquo;s ability to compete in the global market place. My Department will continue to monitor risks to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness closely, and respond as needed to protect Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness for FDI.</p></reply>

As Minister for Finance I cannot determine the lending policies of individual banks including the interest rates they charge for loans including mortgages.   </p>  <p>  I am aware that the general level of new lending interest rates in Ireland are higher than is the case in many other European countries. However, it should also be noted that recent trends indicate that certain mortgage rates have been falling in Ireland. For example, the interest rates on new mortgages have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.63% in July 2022.  It should also be noted that the average Eurozone new mortgage interest rate has increased in recent months and the differential between the Irish and the Eurozone mortgage interest rate has narrowed from 1.4% at end 2021 to 0.55% at end July 2022. Most new mortgages in Ireland are now fixed rate mortgages and the weighted average interest rate on new fixed rate mortgage agreements stood at 2.50% in July 2022, down from 4.11% in December 2014. There has also been a reduction in the interest rates charged on loans to SMEs and consumers over the same period.</p>  <p>  In addition, Irish mortgages have different characteristics from those offered in other countries. For example, many Irish banks include incentives such as cash back offers, which reduce the effective Irish mortgage interest rate. Also Irish mortgages are generally not subject to upfront fees which are typically charged by banks in some other EU jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  Separately the Central Bank introduced a number of increased protections for variable rate mortgage holders which came into effect in 2017. The enhanced measures, which are provided for in an Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code 2012, require lenders to explain to borrowers how their variable interest rates have been set, including in the event of an increase.</p>  <p>  The measures also improve the level of information required to be provided to borrowers on variable rates about other mortgage products which could provide savings for the borrower and signpost the borrower to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's mortgage switching tool.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank also introduced additional changes to the Consumer Protection Code in 2019 to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments, provide additional protections to consumers who are eligible to switch, and facilitate mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework. </p>  <p>  Consumers may reduce average pricing in the mortgage market by availing of switching options to ensure that recent and potential future price reductions through increased competition pass through to the greatest number of customers possible. Indeed a Central Bank study in 2020 estimated that three in every five &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; mortgages for principal dwelling homes stand to save over &euro;1,000 within the first year if they switch and &euro;10,000 over the remaining term.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that greater sustainable competition in the credit market will be of benefit to consumers and other borrowers.  Accordingly, the review of the retail banking market which is now underway in my Department will consider how the banking system can best support economic activity, assess competition and consumer choice in the market for banking services and consider options to further develop the mortgage market.  I expect that the review will be published before the end of the year.</p></reply>

It should be noted that current and capital expenditure in Ireland is funded through a combination of borrowing and taxation receipts. The NTMA has informed me that so far this year, it has issued &euro;7bn of Government bonds. It issued a new 10-year benchmark bond via a syndicated transaction in January and held three dual bond auctions, the most recent of which was on 1 September. </p>  <p>  At &euro;7bn year-to-date, issuance is well below the levels seen in recent years as the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the public finances unwinds and the Exchequer returns to a position of surplus on foot of strong tax revenues. The issuance was completed at a weighted average yield of just under 1.1% and a weighted average maturity of close to 15 years. </p>  <p>  In terms of the factual position, the ECB has no role in determining the use of Exchequer expenditure (whether sourced from borrowing or taxation receipts). The Deputy will be aware that at the most recent meeting of the Governing Council, on 8 September 2022, the ECB decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. </p>  <p>  The ECB has publicly indicated that, based on its current assessment, over the next several meetings the Governing Council expects to raise interest rates further to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. </p>  <p>  At the 8 September meeting the ECB also publicly announced that it intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the Asset Purchase Programme (APP) for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance. As concerns the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio are being reinvested flexibly, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.</p></reply>

The remaining programme-related debt is as follows:</p><p>- EFSM: &euro;22.5 billion</p><p>- EFSF: &euro;18.4 billion</p><p>While the programme loan agreements do not prescribe levels of borrowing or debt that Ireland must comply with, we will remain under Post Programme Surveillance until 75% of financial assistance has been repaid, which is expected to be in 2031. Under the repayment schedule, Ireland will finish repaying the remaining loans to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism in 2042.</p><p>Sixteen Post Programme Surveillance missions to Ireland have taken place during this time, with the most recent mission having taken place in late March 2022. The Commission&rsquo;s Staff Report for this mission was published in May.</p><p>Since the first mission to Ireland in early 2014, Post Programme Surveillance has marked the progress Ireland has made getting back on track after the EU-IMF programme. My officials and I consider Post Programme Surveillance to be an important ongoing two-way dialogue and partnership with the European institutions, the Commission and the European Central Bank as well as the European Stability Mechanism, which participates in the review missions for the purposes of its Early Warning System.</p><p>In the Post Programme Surveillance process, there generally is a high degree of consensus between the Irish authorities and the European institutions in relation to the challenges and risks facing Ireland, and it is beneficial to hear the views of the European institutions on an ongoing basis. In addition, the Commission&rsquo;s staff report following each review mission is helpful, from the Irish authorities&rsquo; perspective, to hear an expert external view regarding some of the challenges and risks that we face as a country.</p><p>A key purpose of Post Programme Surveillance is to assess Ireland&rsquo;s ability to repay outstanding programme loans. The Commission&rsquo;s conclusions in its staff reports to date have been positive regarding Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to repay. In this regard, the Commission most recent Staff Report for the 16<sup>th</sup>PPS concluded that the risks to Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to service its debt to the EFSM and EFSF are low.</p><p>The 17<sup>th</sup>Post Programme Surveillance mission to Ireland is scheduled to take place in early October and I will continue to ensure that Ireland continues to fully comply with all Post Programme Surveillance obligations. </p></reply>

Similarly, Ireland&rsquo;s quick rebound in economic growth following the pandemic, accompanied by strong tax revenue performance, will allow the Government to respond appropriately in the year ahead to the current energy crisis.</p>  <p>  A key determinant of fiscal sustainability is, of course, the State&rsquo;s ability to make repayments on the debt that it has borrowed.  An environment of increasing interest rates has now commenced following a sustained period of low and even negative interest rates, and the European Central Bank has signalled that this will continue as long as inflation rates remain elevated. This means that interest rates will undoubtedly increase on any national debt issued in the coming years and on current national debt on variable interest rates.</p>  <p>  However, Ireland&rsquo;s starting position with regards to current financing costs is relatively favourable. The effective interest rate on the national debt is very low, with nearly three quarters of Ireland&rsquo;s debt at an interest rate of 2 per cent or lower, the bulk of which is, importantly, at fixed rates. Additionally, the vast bulk of Irish debt is in the form of Government bonds, which tend to have a relatively long maturity profile, and around half of outstanding debt instruments are owned by domestic residents, providing additional insulation against adverse shocks. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this favourable financing position, excessive borrowing at a time of increasing rates will erode the progress made in recent years with regards to fiscal sustainability. The debt ratio will have to be kept on a downward trajectory if we are to tackle the medium term challenges of the digital and climate transitions alongside the fiscal costs of an ageing population.</p></reply>

My long-standing position is that the international tax system needs to keep pace with changes in how business is conducted globally, and the overriding premise of the OECD agreement, signed by over 135 countries, is that a global agreement is needed to properly address the taxation of large corporates in a globalised world.  The agreement achieved at the OECD is a fine balance that provides the certainty and stability required for economic growth while at the same time protecting the interests of small countries such as ours.  This agreement will come at a cost in terms of reduced tax receipts but I believe it is a price that is worth paying for the stability and certainty it will bring to the global international tax framework.</p>  <p>  I am fully supportive of the EU efforts to agree the EU Minimum Tax Directive and I expect the file to be agreed in due course.  While full political agreement has not yet been achieved, I am fully supportive of the Czech Presidency&rsquo;s efforts to resolve the political impasse and it remains my hope that the Directive will be agreed soon.  I think it is in everybody's interest to have the EU Minimum Directive agreed, and implemented, on a consistent basis by all 27 Member States.</p>  <p>  A public consultation on the technical implementation of the Directive in Ireland has already taken place. At a domestic level work is ongoing to prepare for transposition into Irish law before the end of 2023.  I am aware that this process is being replicated in many other jurisdictions globally, as we collectively prepare to implement the OECD Agreement.</p>  <p>  The implementation timeframe for these new rules is ambitious. However, it is important that we work towards this agreed timetable on the assumption that countries globally will move together.   </p></reply>

This is an ambitious plan which will provide increased housing supply and affordability.</p>  <p>  While the plan is backed by unprecedented State investment, the Government cannot deliver on this programme alone. The only way we can deliver housing at the substantial scale we need is by also attracting private capital to the market.</p>  <p>  Through modelling undertaken by the Department of Finance, it is estimated that &euro;12 billion of development funding per annum, comprising both debt and equity, will be required to develop the Housing for All target of an average of 33,000 homes per year. Of this &euro;12 billion per annum, an estimated &euro;10 billion will be required from private capital sources. While a portion of this will come from our domestic banks, the majority will be required from international sources.</p>  <p>  Domestic banks set risk limits around the type and nature of lending activity, resulting in selective and prudent lending practices. It is not desirable that domestic banks provide senior debt at unsustainable levels and levels of debt should appropriately reflect the risk profile of development projects.</p>  <p>  As a result, we will attract and welcome inward investment to our housing market, as we have successfully done with investment in other sectors of our economy. This private and patient capital coming from well-established investors such as pension funds is a normal facet of housing investment in many of our European neighbours and beyond.</p>  <p>  A substantial increase in the supply of new homes is the only route to solving Ireland&rsquo;s housing crisis.

Following the appointment of a new UK Prime Minister and her Government, discussions are resuming on the implementation of the Protocol. </p>  <p>  Brexit will have a negative impact on the Irish economy compared to when both Ireland and the UK were members of the European Union. That said, the disruption to the domestic economy from Brexit is playing out more slowly than the fast-moving shocks we have also experienced in terms of Covid-19 and the impact of the situation in Ukraine. </p>  <p>  While the Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for tariff-free trade between the EU and the UK, non-tariff barriers &ndash; such as regulatory checks &ndash; will weigh on cross-border trade. The UK has announced the postponement of the introduction of further import controls to the end of 2023. As a result, the full impact of Brexit will not be evident for some time, however this will not lessen the impact on the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Building on its early and extensive contingency planning and analysis work which started even before the 2016 referendum, the Government has dedicated substantial resources to preparing for Brexit and the systems in place are working well. We have invested significantly in new infrastructure, systems and staff, and continue to engage intensively with stakeholders and to provide a range of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for impacted sectors and businesses. </p>  <p>  Ireland will be the largest beneficiary from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR), receiving &euro;1.165 billion, the aim of which is to provide financial support to the most affected Member States, regions and sectors to deal with the adverse consequences of Brexit. Funding will be directed at areas such as enterprise supports; supports for the agri-food and fisheries sectors, reskilling and retraining; and checks and controls at our ports and airports. Work is continuing across Government, with all Departments examining measures that need to be taken to counteract the negative consequences of Brexit. Further allocations from the BAR will be made as the impacts of Brexit are worked through.</p>  <p>  It remains important that we continue to prepare for any unforeseen consequences over the coming period, including as discussions continue on the implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Government is committed and remains focused on protecting our economic and financial interests, and will continue to work to minimise the disruption that Brexit will have on the economy and peoples&rsquo; livelihoods to the greatest extent possible. </p></reply>

With little evidence of permanent economic scarring, it seemed as though our economy would rebound strongly this year.  However, the outlook quickly changed with Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, sparking an energy supply crisis and ensuing inflation.</p>  <p>  Our economy is now faced with significant headwinds, the most prominent being the cost of living challenges faced by individuals and businesses in Ireland. Consumer price (HICP) inflation rose to 9 per cent in August. The inflationary shock has been mainly driven by energy price rises, but spillover effects to core (non-energy) inflation are now evident. The government is committed supporting individuals and businesses to face these inflationary challenges. As part of Budget 2023 next week, the Government will set out a series of targeted once-off measures to be introduced over the course of the winter to help alleviate cost of living pressures. While there will be a significant support package included in the budget, it must be stressed that the government cannot absorb the full impact of inflation and we must ensure that we do not inadvertently add further to inflationary pressures.</p>  <p>  Despite the challenging nature of this economic cycle, Ireland&rsquo;s economic fundamentals remain strong, especially in the labour market with 2 &frac12; million people currently in employment, and the unemployment rate falling to just 4.3 per cent in August. Despite the challenges posed by Brexit, the external side of the economy also continues to perform strongly, with strong export growth in the ICT and pharmaceutical sectors. </p></reply>

We have emerged from an unprecedented pandemic and now face a new challenge as the Russian war in Ukraine has resulted in inflation at levels not seen in many decades. </p><p>However, I would also note that we have, supported by Government fiscal policy, experienced a remarkable recovery from the pandemic. There are now more people at work in Ireland than ever before, and, despite the many challenges we face, our economy remains fundamentally strong.</p><p>The best way in which we can maintain the confidence of market participants in these uncertain times is to keep our public finances on a sustainable pathway, rebuilding our fiscal buffers while intervening, when necessary, to protect our economy from external shocks. </p><p><i>Budget 2023</i>will strike the balance between providing support today and reinforcing our future stability, helping to ensure that we maintain our positive position in the markets.</p></reply>

While historically Ireland has been a relatively cash-intensive economy, advances in technology and changing customer demands have prompted a rapid increase in the take-up of electronic payments. The Covid-19 pandemic has acted as a potential catalyst for the move towards digital payments and the move away from cash.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding a significant increase in the take-up of electronic payments, cash remains a vital part of the Irish payment system. Banks have a key role in maintaining the flow of cash through the economy and ensuring appropriate access to retail banking services for all in society, including the vulnerable.</p>  <p>  The changes currently underway in the Irish retail banking sector are a reflection of the wider challenges the banking sector is facing, not only in Ireland but also abroad. It is because of these changes that I have instructed my Department to undertake a broad-ranging review of the retail banking sector, which is currently taking place.</p>  <p>  A key part of the review will be to examine the use and availability of cash in Ireland and determine whether any legislative proposal is needed in this regard.</p>  <p>  The public consultation undertaken as part of the review contained a number of questions relating to access to cash. One of these questions noted the concerns which are being raised around access to cash and asked for submissions on what should be done to protect access to cash.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently working on the Review and their draft report will be delivered to me in November.</p></reply>

In this regard the EU Capital Markets Union initiative - which aims to get investment and savings flowing across all member states for the benefit of citizens, businesses and investors - stresses the importance of additional and alternative funding opportunities within the EU. This greater diversification of financing sources will reduce the current level of reliance on bank funding, increase private risk sharing within the single market, and is intended to make the EU&rsquo;s financial system more stable as a result, thereby unlocking additional funding for economic activity in Europe.</p></reply>

Pending the establishment and commencement of operations of the new short-term letting registration system to be operated by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the six month period referred to may be extended for further 6 month periods subject to positive resolutions by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  This legislation has been notified to the EU Commission under the requirements of the EU TRIS (Technical Regulation Information Society) Directive having regard to potential implications for internal market and information society services.  This is a standard notification requirement for relevant legislative proposals by national Governments so that any proposals in this area can be examined by the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage continues to engage with relevant stakeholder groups on the detailed operational arrangements to be applied in relation to the proposed measure which will be provided for in supplementary regulations.</p></reply>

Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.</p>  <p>  There has been significant construction products inflation during 2022 due to a number of factors, notably the Russian invasion of Ukraine, rising energy prices and constrained supply chains.  A central element of the Government&rsquo;s housing policy is to support the delivery of public housing on local authority land.  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing from 2022 to 2026. In the same period over 29,000 affordable homes will be delivered including 18,600 affordable purchase homes and 10,400 cost rental homes.</p>  <p>  A key action under Housing for All was the preparation of Housing Delivery Action Plans by local authorities. These Plans set out details of social and affordable housing delivery over the period 2022-2026, in line with targets set under Housing for All. The Plans also include details of the locations and delivery streams for social and affordable housing, including land available to deliver this housing and future land requirements. The Housing Delivery Action Plans are available on the websites of the relevant local authorities.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland has launched the Built to Innovate campaign to drive awareness of these opportunities in the construction sector. Enterprise Ireland seeks to support companies in the construction sector who wish to pursue:</p><p>- Enhanced usage and implementation of MMC</p><p>- Implementation of Lean training in both manufacturing and off-site environments</p><p>- Improving the use of digital tools that can bring productivity benefits</p><p>- Funding for research concepts or process innovative ideas</p><p>The Building Regulations 1997-2021 set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings (including houses), extensions to existing buildings as well as for material alterations and certain material changes of use to existing buildings.

Delivery of these homes is primarily a matter for each Local Authority, though the Department supports delivery through grants from the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF). The Department does not set price ceilings for homes the AHF will support.  However, Local Authorities are required to demonstrate that the funding provided will allow the delivery of the homes at purchase prices below market value and that the homes are suitable for the moderate income, first-time buyer households which are the target market.</p>  <p>  Under the legislation, the purchase price of a home made available by a Local Authority varies according to the property and the purchasing power of an eligible applicant, though will be between 5% and a maximum 40% below the market value of the home. However, this is subject to a minimum sale price set by the Local Authority having regard to the various costs associated with delivery and the level of financial subsidy available, including grant funding from the AHF. This is set out in the Affordable Housing (No. 2) Regulations 2021 (available online at www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2022/si/183/made/en/print).</p>  <p>  Separately, the First Home Scheme, launched on 7 July 2022, supports first-time buyers in purchasing new houses and apartments in the private market through the use of an equity share model. It uses regional price ceilings aligned to the median prices paid for new-build homes by first time buyers in each area. This is to temper any inflationary pressures and to target support at the lower part of the price distribution in each area, as well as to encourage additional housing supply at this price level. Full details of the First Home Scheme, including the price ceilings broken down by Local Authority area, are available on the scheme website: www.firsthomescheme.ie.</p></reply>

It is intended that information across all delivery streams, including AHB delivery and LDA delivery, will be gathered centrally and I expect that my Department will be in a position to begin reporting on affordable delivery on a quarterly basis later this year.</p>  <p>  To date, six projects in four local authorities have advertised a cumulative total of 325 affordable purchase homes.

Approximately 300 CREL funded homes have been delivered to date in 2022.</p>  <p>  Cost Rental properties are also in development by local authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF) and 50 Cost Rental homes tenanted in Enniskerry Road earlier this year were supported by  approximately &euro;4.5m in funding from my Department. The AHF will help to facilitate a local authority-led financing structure for Cost Rental, which will provide important opportunities for local authorities to directly delivery Cost Rental homes on their own lands, such as at Emmet Road in Dublin City.</p>  <p>  The LDA will also deliver Cost Rental homes, as well as affordable purchase homes on its own portfolio of sites or through Project Tosaigh. Project Tosaigh is a market engagement initiative to unlock land with full planning permission that is not being developed by private sector owners. The LDA has advised that it will deliver Project Tosaigh cost rental homes and affordable purchase homes in partnership with local authorities during 2022. Full details will be made public as commercial arrangements are concluded. Full details of the initiative can be found here: lda.ie/home-building-partnership/.  </p>  <p>In respect of the LDA, details of the work that the LDA is progressing on public lands that will deliver Affordable Purchase and Cost Rental can be found here: lda.ie/projects-schemes/</p></reply>

My Department provides funding to all recognised schools in the Free Education Scheme by way of per capita grants. The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. These grants may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities. I have committed to seeking funding for further increases in the capitation in future budgets.</p>  <p>  My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) which run until 2024. OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. It is planned to run future competitions to ensure that bulk rates continue to be available from 2024 onwards. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification and is advancing a number of programmes to further develop this.</p>  <p>  The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability www.energyineducation.ie. Typically savings of between 5 to 10% are identified through low and no cost measures, while some schools participating have identified potential savings of up to 15% or more.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the cost of living pressures facing families and schools and these issues will be considered as part of the budgetary process.</p></reply>

My Department and the NCSE continue to work very closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p><p>I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen 383 new special classes open, bringing the total of special classes to 2,535 opened nationwide for the 2022/23 school-year. The 383 new special classes for 2022/23 is broken down by 253 at primary level and 130 at post primary level.</p><p>In relation to the school specifically referenced by the Deputy, I am advised that there is ongoing engagement with and support for the school by the NCSE. The school currently has one ASD special class, opened in their existing accommodation.</p><p>I am also advised that NCSE is currently engaged with the school regarding the establishment of further special class provision at the school. </p><p>A building project for this school is in the early stages of the tender process.  The Design Team are issuing invitations to tender.  Subject to no issues arising, it is envisaged works will commence in Quarter 2 of 2023 with a construction timeframe of 22 months. On completion, this project will deliver accommodation for 2 special classes.</p><p>My Department and the NCSE work closely in planning for the delivery of new places required to meet forecasted demand.</p><p>Should the NCSE sanction the opening of a second class in the intervening period, my Department will also engage with the school in relation to the provision of an additional special class to serve the needs of students with ASD while the process of building takes place.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p><p>The local SENO engages regularly with the school and families locally and remains available to the school to provide further advice and support.</p></reply>

In the last school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p><p>In July 2022, Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the coming school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures.</p><p>Ticket registration for the 2022/23 school year closed on 29 July by which time almost 130,000 applications/registrations were received for mainstream school transport. This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year.</p><p>Already 124,000 tickets for the 2022/2023 school year have been issued to applicants for the new school year. To date, circa 20,400 additional places have been created for children for the 2022/2023 school year. </p><p>The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre are deemed eligible.</p><p>Any pupils/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p><p>In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p><p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level be continued for the 2022/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29<sup>th</sup>April and registered for a ticket by the 29<sup>th</sup>July.</p><p>Children who are not eligible for school transport, but who completed the application process on time, will be considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.</p><p>Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places, in these cases Bus &Eacute;ireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process.</p><p>It is very important for families to note that the application deadline for 2022/23 was 29 April 2022, and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is <b>a &lsquo;late application&rsquo;</b>and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.Late applications will only be assessed after all &ldquo;on time&rdquo; applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants.</p><p>For safety reasons, only students with a valid ticket for school transport will be permitted to travel on school transport services.</p></reply>

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. These grants may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities. I have committed to seeking funding for further increases in the capitation in future budgets.</p>  <p>  My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) which run until 2024. OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. It is planned to run future competitions to ensure that bulk rates continue to be available from 2024 onwards. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification and is advancing a number of programmes to further develop this.</p>  <p>  The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability www.energyineducation.ie.

Additional Needs Payment is an overarching term used to refer to Exceptional and Urgent Needs Payments, and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the person&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Decisions on Exceptional Needs Payments and SWA supplements are made at the discretion of the Community Welfare Officers (CWO) administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.  The CWO&rsquo;s discretionary powers are a major strength of the SWA scheme as it confers upon these officers the capacity to provide an immediate flexible response to identified needs. </p>  <p>  The Additional Needs Payment is not a new scheme, and it comes within the remit of the general SWA scheme operational guidelines.  An information note in relation to Additional Needs Payments issued to all staff in the Department in June this year and this set out the role of CWOs in assisting customers with cost-of-living expenses.  This note, which has been augmented with a virtual training webinar and a number of training bulletins, directs CWOs to use their discretionary powers in considering applications for Additional Needs Payments and it places significant emphasis on assisting customers with cost-of-living expenses.  While there are household income guidelines, it has been emphasised to the CWS team in the Department that these are guidelines only and the customers need for assistance arising from difficulties in meeting increased costs for food, fuel, electricity, and heating is the primary consideration.  </p>  <p>  These Additional Needs Payments are demand-led and are funded accordingly.  This support is available to anybody on a low income who is experiencing financial hardship regardless of the number of hours they work per week or if they have applied for an Additional Needs Payment previously. Anyone who needs support should contact the Department either through their local Intreo Centre or Branch Office or by phoning 0818 60 70 80.  Further details on the Additional Needs Payment are available online at: www.gov.ie/en/service/4eb45-additional-needs-payment/ </p>  <p>  The Community Welfare Service (CWS) is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers, ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.  Based on the available data, it is estimated that 59% of applications for Additional Needs Payments are finalised within 0-4 weeks and 90% are finalised within 0-8 weeks.  Where an application is not finalised within this timeframe, this is generally due to additional information or documentation being requested from the customer to support their application.  Where it is evident that a customer is experiencing particular hardship and their application is complete and accompanied by the required documentation, their application is prioritised. </p>  <p>  My Department has introduced innovations this year to increase efficiency in processing applications for SWA payments.  One of these is the establishment of a back-office team to undertake the preparatory work on applications - for example, the gathering of supporting documentation that is necessary to assess and finalise a claim.  This method of processing applications supports a number of CWS areas across the country and it has been found to be very effective in releasing Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) from the requirement to undertake administrative tasks and to focus on delivery of services.  It allows for increased capacity for CWOs to meet with customers as required and to process claims.  This model will be extended to cover all CWS areas across the country in the coming months. </p>  <p>  The delivery of crucial Community Welfare Services to meet the challenges and the needs of vulnerable customers across the country remains a priority for my Department.  The continued availability of locally based CWO is a cornerstone of the service.  CWOs can facilitate emergency and in-person meetings in 51 Intreo Centres across business hours, five days per week.  Some CWOs are based in Social Welfare Branch Offices and provide appointments at those offices.  In addition to meeting citizens in Intreo Centres, Branch Offices and DSP offices, CWOs can facilitate an appointment within a short time of a person requiring such a meeting, at a mutually agreed location, including at the person's home.   </p>  <p>  It is vital that the CWS is an easily accessible, flexible, and responsive service to meet the varied needs of vulnerable people, particularly in a time of crisis or emergency.  While changes to modernise and improve the service for customers are a feature of the service, continued in-person customer engagement remains a pivotal feature within the community welfare service. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household. </p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct limited resources in as targeted a manner as possible.  This ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p>  <p>  Disablement Benefit is a benefit under the Occupational Injuries Scheme.  It can be paid to a recipient who suffers a loss of physical or mental faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or from work, or a prescribed disease contracted at work.  The contribution requirements for the scheme are minimal when compared to other Departmental benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  People in receipt of Disablement Benefit (without another social welfare payment) can work full or part time and continue to receive the Benefit Payment &ndash; in other words, they are not prevented from generating additional income. </p>  <p>  Disablement Benefit is paid at the same time as most social welfare payments including Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, State Pension and One-Parent Family Payment.  It is not considered as means for most social welfare means-assessed schemes except for Fuel Allowance, Supplementary Welfare Allowance or Working Family Payment.</p>  <p>  Incapacity Supplement is a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance. Incapacity Supplement was introduced as a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance in recognition of the fact that  Incapacity Supplement is an increase payable in addition to Disablement Benefit where a person is considered to be permanently incapable of work as a result of an occupational accident or disease and does not qualify for another Social Welfare benefit such as Illness Benefit. </p>  <p>  Therefore, while Disablement Benefit on its own is a disqualifying payment for Fuel Allowance because a person may continue to work or take up work, or may receive another social welfare payment in parallel, qualification for Incapacity Supplement in addition to Disablement Benefit qualifies that recipient for Fuel Allowance (subject to satisfying all other qualifying criteria).</p>  <p>  I have asked officials in my Department to prepare a report reviewing the treatment of Disablement Benefit under the Fuel Allowance scheme.  This report is now finalised and the report's contents and recommendations will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are approximately 1,043,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that, in general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  Importantly, as many illnesses or physical conditions have an impact across a spectrum from mild to severe, entitlement to these social welfare schemes is not provided on the basis of a diagnosis but on the basis of the impact of that diagnosis on the individual concerned.  In this way, resources can be targeted to people in most need.</p>  <p>  Therefore, while a diagnosis of a particular medical condition will be required to establish if a person may be eligible for certain social welfare schemes, evidence of impact is also required before entitlement to the scheme or the related free travel scheme is established.  The sole exception to this general approach is in respect of people who are blind.</p>  <p>  While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.</p>  <p>  Any such change would also require potentially very significant additional funding for the free travel scheme and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary resources.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers and include help towards recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Revocation cannot be determined until there is prior consultation with the person concerned.  A person who has a gender recognition certificate revoked has the right to an appeal of the Minister's decision to the courts. Since commencement of the Act in mid-2015, there have been no revocations under s14 of the Act to date. </p>  <p>  Section 15 provides that a person to whom a gender recognition certificate has issued may apply to have that certificate revoked.

Supports to those arriving and fleeing the war in Ukraine are coordinated at local level by the Community Forum.</p>  <p>  Building on structures and relationships that were highly effective during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Community Response Forum enables all those involved to work together under the stewardship of the Local Authority. The role of the Community Response Forum is to provide a co-ordination point for the community and voluntary response in their area. Supplementing the supports and services being provided by government agencies at local level, the forum provides for communication and information sharing in the coordination of local community and voluntary actions in providing community supports to the new BOTP communities.</p>  <p>  Through the efforts of local volunteers, community workers, public bodies and private sector contributions, many recent arrivals are being supported with basic needs such as clothing, access to the internet, transport, English classes and information on how to access local services such as childcare, healthcare and education. </p>  <p>  Other areas of my Department are also actively supporting arrivals from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  The Early Years Division in my Department has taken responsibility for a number of actions supporting Ukrainian parents and children, allowing them to access preschool and ensuring children&rsquo;s well-being. These actions have included the development and translation of introductory information on the Irish early learning and care sector. A capacity analysis across the country identified vacant preschool places and work is ongoing to match children to the vacant places and to create additional early childhood care and education, ECCE, places, where possible, in areas of high demand. Information on the access and inclusion model for children with disabilities accessing preschool has been translated into Ukrainian and Russian.</p>  <p>  Tusla has also put additional staff into its services around educational welfare too in order to support the work of linking students to school places. </p>  <p>  Tusla has a significant role in the State's response to support individuals, particularly women and children, displaced from Ukraine as a result of the war and coming into Ireland. Tusla is committed to balancing the needs of families in a humanitarian crisis with its child protection responsibilities and requirement to support families and promote the welfare of children.</p>  <p>  With regard to supports for children, Tusla has compiled a list of 116 community contact centres across the country. These are local family support services which are either provided directly by Tusla or Tusla-funded services.</p>  <p>  As a country, we have responded well to assist those relocating to Ireland from the conflict in Ukraine. I and my officials will continue to assist Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection with the services within my remit, and to coordinate closely with other Departments and agencies in providing a whole of government response.</p></reply>

The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study.

Engagements have been ongoing between my Department's officials, the Department of Health, CORU, QQI and DBS, and all relevant parties will continue to work to identify a way forward for affected students.</p>  <p>  I understand that DBS has been meeting with its students on an individual basis to explore their options and I understand these options primarily include the refund of fees paid or the transfer to another social care programme where possible and suitable. Both QQI and CORU are working with DBS and other programme providers to support and facilitate the transfer of students where they have chosen this option and these engagements are ongoing.   </p>  <p>  The options available to students will depend on what stage their studies are at, and some students may have more than one option available to them. I encourage the affected students to remain in close contact with DBS regarding this issue, as they are best placed to provide updates as to the options available.</p></reply>

These types of attacks cannot, and will not, be tolerated.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that Assistant Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) and all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the DMR remain conscious and alert to any criminal offences which may be perceived by the victims or any other people to, in whole or in part, be motivated by hostility or prejudice, based on actual or perceived age, disability, race, colour, nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or gender.  All Hate Crime Investigations have a Garda Diversity Officer (GDO) assigned. </p>  <p>  Support is available to and provided to victims of domestic abuse, including members of the LGBTQ+ community. Domestic Abuse Coordinator Teams (DACT) are in place in each District in the DMR and case managers are appointed to maintain appropriate contact with the injured party, including those who are members of the of LGBTQ+ community. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that there are 110 Garda Diversity Officers trained in the DMR and allocated across each of the six Garda Divisions. The 34 of these trained GDOs in the DMR North Central and South Central Divisions, together with plans to train additional members represents An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s commitment in the DMR to continue to deliver the necessary support and specialist assistance to members of the LGBTQ+ community. All Garda&iacute;, including GDOs undertake online Hate Crime training, which included significant input from LGBTQ+ organizations and representatives in creating same. </p>  <p>  Garda management in the DMR continue to fully optimize all available Garda resources to ensure that there is a sustained overt and covert Garda presence in Dublin City Centre to reduce opportunities for anti-social behaviour, public order offences and assaults from happening. This is supported through vital Operations initiated in the city by Assistant Commissioner, DMR aimed at safeguarding vulnerable persons, such as, Operation Citizen, and Operation Saul, to name a few.</p>  <p>  As outlined, there is ongoing training that will increase members' understanding and will enhance the Garda service being delivered to victims of crime including members of the LBGTQ+ community. The GDO network continues to expand and develop across the DMR improving accessibility of the Garda Service to minority, diverse and hard to reach communities.</p>  <p>  Separately, as the Deputy will be aware, we are currently developing legislation which will update existing laws on incitement to hatred and introduce hate crime laws for the first time. </p>  <p>  A new Bill which is expected to be published in the coming weeks, will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences &ndash; ie hate crimes - where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic.</p>  <p>  The Bill will also strengthen the law around incitement to hatred  - or hate speech &ndash; by reflecting the current context more accurately; including online hateful content. Offences will include inciting hatred against a person or persons because they are associated with a protected characteristic, and also dissemination or distribution of material inciting hatred.</p>  <p>  The protected characteristics that underpin the new legislation are race; colour; nationality; religion, ethnic or national origin; sexual orientation; gender (including gender expression or gender identify); and disability.</p>  <p>  Development of this legislation follows a comprehensive consultation process that began in 2019 and included public events across Ireland, along with surveys, consultation and engagement with people with lived experience of the impact of hate speech and hate crime.</p>  <p>  I met with LGBTQ+ organisations in recent months to update them on progress in developing the Bill and to ensure that their concerns inform the final drafting process.</p>  <p>  The text of the new legislation is currently in the final stages of drafting, and it is expected to go to Government for approval in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007. Every Government department and every agency is responsible for ensuring implementation of the UNCRPD. </font></p><p><font color="#201F1E">Disabled Persons Organisations are &lsquo;representative organisations&rsquo; within the obligations contained in the UNCRPD. Under UNCRPD Article 4(3), states parties are obliged to consult closely with and actively involve representative organisations in the development of law and policy. States parties are also obliged to give representative organisations a role in monitoring processes. </font></p><p><font color="#201F1E">The Department of Health engages with a range of disability representative organisations in ongoing discussion of policy and resource matters through channels such as the Department&rsquo;s Disability Consultative Committee, and through direct consultation, in order to ensure the voice of people with disabilities is heard in matters affecting them. </font></p><p><font color="#201F1E">In its work to prepare a Disability Action Plan to advance provision of additional capacity in specialist community-based disability services, in September/October 2021 this Department also undertook wide-ranging a four-strand consultation with representative disability organisations and with individuals with lived experience of disability to inform that work. This included an online consultation event, two in-person consultation events for disability service users, written submissions from the national disability umbrella groups, and an online consultation survey. Overall around 800 individuals took part in this consultation process.</font></p><p><font color="#201F1E">The Health Service Executive also has standing consultations with disability organisations through its Disability Consultative Forum.</font></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-09-22a.873.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092200070#WRQ00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 324 to 326, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the specific challenges faced by the nursing home sector related to price inflation and increased energy costs. I am currently working on proposals to support smaller and voluntary nursing homes in relation to the specific challenges they are experiencing.</p>  <p>  I engage consistently on an ongoing basis with Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI), the representative organisation for private and voluntary nursing homes. I have met directly with NHI and updated them in detail on progress being made in relation to this matter.  I have also met with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials. I have visited a number of nursing homes to discuss this issue with management of both public and private/voluntary nursing units. It is imperative that nursing homes manage potential cost pressures in line with their regulatory and contractual responsibilities, maintaining their quality of care so that residents&rsquo; lived experience and comfort is not affected.  </p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Maximum prices for individual nursing homes are agreed with the NTPF following negotiations and based on the NTPF&rsquo;s cost criteria. These criteria include:</p>  <p>  - Costs reasonably incurred by the nursing home- Local market prices- Historic prices- Overall budgetary capacity</p>  <p>  The NTPF carry out this role independently under the NHSS Act 2009 and there is no role for Ministers or the Department in these negotiations.  The Department continues to work with the NTPF to take forward the recommended actions that emerged from the NTPF pricing review, as well as taking forward the nine recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs published last December.</p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight the other supports provided to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, has been in place since the start of the pandemic. Over &euro;144 million has been made available to date under the scheme. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment, having been extended up to September 2022. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.  In response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations by September 2022.  </p>  <p>  Given the importance of nursing homes and the NHSS to the wider health and social care system - with a budget of over &euro;1 billion, and over 22,000 residents supported - it is essential that policy measures are examined with due care in order to ensure the government's objectives are delivered and avoid unintended consequences. I hope to be in a position to update sector representatives as soon as possible.</p></reply>

A central aim of Healthy Ireland is to &quot;<i>create an environment where every individual and sector of society can play their part in achieving a healthy Ireland</i>&rdquo;. </p><p>The &euro;15.39 million Healthy Ireland Fund budget for 2022 covers actions supporting local communities, through both the Healthy Ireland Fund and the new Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities Programme. The Healthy Ireland Fund provides supports at local level, through Local Community Development Committees LCDCs) and Children and Young People's Service Committees (CYPSCs) at local authority level. </p><p>The Local Strand of the Healthy Ireland Fund and the Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities Programme variously provide supports for projects and programmes that support health and well-being, including physical activity, diet and nutrition, positive mental health, supports for parenting, to quit smoking, and to reduce alcohol consumption with additional focus on families and young people, and supporting people and communities living with disadvantage.</p><p>The Healthy Ireland Fund also supports programmes at national level, including Age Friendly Ireland, Sport Ireland, co-funding for the Department of Education's Active School Flag programme and the Healthy Ireland at Your Library programme. </p><p>The Healthy Ireland allocation to Sport Ireland includes supports for programmes for people living with a disability, including the Special Olympics Young Athletes programme, supports for research and the Get Ireland Walking, Get Ireland Swimming, Get Ireland Running and Get Ireland Cycling programmes. </p><p>Healthy Ireland is also supporting the development and piloting of a Physical Activity Pathways in Healthcare Model in 2022, in collaboration with the HSE and Sport Ireland. These supports are funding development and co-ordination of programmes to increase access to physical activity for people who are older, frailer, living with a disability or disadvantage, and who otherwise experience more barriers to accessing physical activity, and will include elements of physical activity prescription. </p><p>Healthy Ireland also participates in the DTCAGSM Sports Leadership Group, led by the Minister of State for Sport and the Gaeltacht, Jack Chambers, T.D., which guides the implementation of the National Sports Policy. </p><p>A review of the National Physical Activity Plan (NPAP) was published this year, and is available on the Healthy Ireland website.  The Review contains recommendations regarding the future direction of the Plan. The provision of additional physical activity opportunities and supports to people living with a disability, chronic conditions (including mental illness), frailty and/or living with disadvantage were considered as part of the review. The NPAP Implementation Group will be considering renewing the NPAP in the coming months, bearing in mind the recommendations included in the Review, and the need to support the National Sports Policy without unnecessary overlap.</p><p>The Healthy Ireland Fund is also used to empower citizens to adopt healthier behaviours, through various citizen engagement campaigns.  The Healthy Ireland campaigns have been running since 2018, initially with a focus on three themes; Eat Well, Think Well and Be Well, representing healthy eating, positive mental health and being active. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the <i>In This Together </i>and <i>Be Well</i>campaigns were re-purposed to provide supports for resilience, health and well-being while necessary Covid-19 restrictions were in place. The promotion of physical activity across society, in partnership with DTCAGSM and Sport Ireland, continues to be a core element of this work.</p><p>Healthy Ireland sponsored Operation Transformation in 2021 and in 2022, which featured a wide range of relevant themes, including healthy eating, physical activity and sport participation, quitting smoking, losing weight, mental health and men's and women's health. The programme reached approximately 450,000 viewers in 2021. Several settings-based initiatives are also supported, including Healthy Campuses, Workplaces and Clubs.  </p><p>There is overwhelming evidence that investment in prevention is cost-effective in both the short and longer term. In addition to pre-existing evidence that tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption, obesity and inactivity are key risk factors for chronic disease, there is increasing evidence that healthy behaviours provide protection against infectious disease also.</p><p>Public health advice from the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) to the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), following a wide review of published studies, concluded that &ldquo;  <i>&hellip;in general those who are overweight or obese, who smoke, who have inadequate levels of Vitamin D, are physically inactive and consume excessive amounts of alcohol are more likely to contract COVID-19 or have poorer outcomes.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Needless to say, it is unlikely that Covid-19 is the only infectious disease where adherence to public health guidelines regarding activity levels, weight and tobacco and alcohol misuse is protective. This is borne out by the scientific literature; for example:</p><p>- Regular physical activity can reduce the risk from upper respiratory tract infections;</p><p>- High levels of regular physical activity has been shown to result in 31% decreased risk of contracting infectious disease in the community;</p><p>- Active individuals show a 37% decrease in risk of infectious disease mortality as compared with inactive individuals;</p><p>- Regular physical activity has been shown to increase antibody levels post-vaccination, with these effects more marked in older adults. </p><p>It is clear, therefore, that national policies, such as the National Physical Activity Plan and the National Sports Policy, that seek to tackle one or more of these risk factors and to improve public health, may be even more vital in terms of protecting public health and well-being than previously realised.</p><p>In summary, investing in public health generates cost-effective health outcomes and can contribute to wider sustainability, with economic, social and environmental benefits.  Healthy Ireland is a core framework for the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Living Pillar and provides the central platform to address the social determinants of health that impact how people live their lives.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers on a recommendation of the Seafood Taskforce and offers grant rates of between 30% and 50% for capital investment in SME seafood processing enterprises, varying depending on the degree of value added in the project. </p>  <p>  The scheme is designed to counter the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  It seeks to support the processing sector to engage in transformational change, mitigating the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and Brexit. It also seeks to build more environmentally friendly, sustainable and competitive enterprises which serve the EU and wider global markets, create higher levels of employment more locally, and make better and more sustainable use of Irish landed or imported raw material. The scheme is aimed at supporting industry-led transformative capital investments that enable the sector to focus on 'creating more from less' in the wake of reduced supply of raw material. It is also aimed at moving enterprises in the sector further up the supply chain to produce higher value products and shift the industry to a focus on secondary processing and beyond to products targeting end-user markets. The scheme is proposed for funding under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</p>  <p>  The scheme received State Aid clearance on the basis that it provides supports to SMEs only. This is in line with the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Guidelines which require consistency with the provisions of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation (508/2014), which in turn restricts grant aid to the processing sector to SMEs only.  Both article 69 of the EMFF Regulation for the 2014-20 period and article 28 of the new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund Regulation (2021/1139) for the 2021-27 period restrict grant supports for capital investment in seafood processing to SMEs. Under the EU funds available for seafood development, supports to non-SMEs is permitted only through financial instruments.  </p>  <p>  The schemes, referenced by the Deputy, provided for the beef and dairy processing sector were operated by Enterprise Ireland an agency of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment. Any future Enterprise Ireland schemes are a matter for An T&aacute;naiste ,in his capacity as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. My officials will provide any assistance possible to both Enterprise Ireland or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on any future scheme development.</p></reply>

In July, I met with representative groups from the industry and discussed the impacts of the high fuel and energy prices on the profitability of fishing and seafood processing. The challenges facing the industry are concurrent with the impacts of the Brexit Trade &amp;amp; Cooperation Agreement. In this context, I have been active over the last number of months in implementing support schemes for the wider seafood sector and coastal communities, in line with the recommendations of the &ldquo;Report of the Seafood Task Force - Navigating Change.&rdquo;  </p>  <p>  Included in the schemes launched to date is the &euro;45 million Brexit Processing Capital Support Scheme. This scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the cost of renewable energy generation investments and energy efficiency investments. Similarly, the &euro;25 million Blue Economy Enterprise Development Scheme offers support for a range of entrepreneurial activities including seafood related activities. A key component of the scheme is support for investment in renewable energy. These supports not only provide investment in seafood enterprises, but also ensure they can remain competitive in the long term and be less exposed to issues within their operating environments. </p>  <p>  I have worked very closely with industry to develop short and longer term supports to assist the wider seafood industry cope with the consequences of Brexit and the circumstances that have affected the industry since then. Since the publication of the Task Force Report, &euro;225m in supports and developmental strategies have been launched. These are more generous and comprehensive that those put in place elsewhere and will enable our seafood sector and coastal communities to overcome the significant challenges it faces.</p></reply>
