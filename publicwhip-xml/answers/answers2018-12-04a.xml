I was accompanied by the Minister for Natural Resources, Community Affairs and Digital Development, Sean Canney TD. </p>  <p>  The discussion at the summit covered political developments for Administrations since the last summit in June, including on the implications of Brexit, particularly for relationships across the islands.  The Council also discussed the current political situation in Northern Ireland and endorsed plans for a future programme of work for the Council&rsquo;s Digital Inclusion work sector.</p>  <p>  I had side meetings with Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in which we exchanged views on issues of mutual interest and continued co-operation. These  discussions focused mainly on Brexit and its impacts on business and citizens and on developments in Westminster and Brussels.  </p>  <p>  I also took the opportunity to speak with UK Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington on Brexit and on the absence of an agreement between the parties on re-establishing the Northern Ireland Executive.  I underlined the importance of the restoration of the institutions in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and undertook to continue to work with the British government to back the northern parties to achieve this outcome.</p></reply>

To that end, my Department's Irish Language Scheme 2016 - 2019 contains a number of commitments designed to ensure that any customers of the Department of the Taoiseach who wish to conduct their business through Irish can do so.  </p>  <p>  The primary focus of my Department's work involves interaction with other Government Departments and Agencies.  As a result, it does not experience a significant level of demand from the public for services in Irish. </p>  <p>  That said, my Department recognises the importance of having staff fluent in and capable of providing services through Irish.  Some staff working in my Department have indicated that they have proficiency in Irish and are competent to provide service to customers in Irish to varying degrees. Of these, two employees with a high level of proficiency in Irish have been designated to provide services to the public in Irish in accordance with my Department's Official Languages Scheme 2016 - 2019, and this number is sufficient to meet the existing demand.  </p>  <p>  Irish language courses are also readily available to all employees of the Department through the Department's Human Resources Unit.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland has also held several Brexit advisory clinics throughout the country. </p>  <p>  As a response to a key challenge cited by many companies, Enterprise Ireland will shortly be rolling out a new Customs Insight online support to demystify customs procedures. This will be available for any company to use whether they are Enterprise Ireland clients or not. The course will highlight the responsibilities of companies and will explain some of the main customs procedures and documentation involved.</p>  <p>  As Chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, I have prioritised supporting the retail sector to develop their online capability and enhance their competitiveness, and I recently launched a new pilot Online Retail Scheme with a fund of up to &euro;1.25 million which will be administered by Enterprise Ireland. The scheme will support retail businesses of 20 employees or more under the areas of research, strategy development, implementation and training who are ready to strategically grow their online capability. The first call opened on 24 October and will close on the 5   December.  There will also be a second call in 2019.</p>  <p>  The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) nationwide are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts of Brexit. </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;5 million in Budget 2019 has been allocated to enable the LEOs to support a broad range of indigenous micro-enterprises prepare for Brexit. This funding will be used for complementary training and awareness programs to support firms throughout the country, in all regions, in the area of both import and export customs implications and procedures. </p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland (ITI) is planning to expand the range of supports offered as part of their Brexit Advisory Service in 2019. The new initiatives will include a &lsquo;Start to Act&rsquo; voucher, valued at &euro;5,000, which will augment their &lsquo;Start to Plan&rsquo; vouchers. The Brexit Advisory Service will also increase its digital learning delivery, making content available in an online training environment that can be conveniently accessed by SMEs. </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;1 million funding has been allocated to ITI in 2019 which will enable the body to engage with more of the companies that are seeking support through the Brexit Advisory Service, as well as meeting demand in existing programmes which are all designed to promote and support cross-border trade.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-04a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400067#WRA02200"><p>Since becoming Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have made regional development my top priority. Indeed, enterprise development and job creation in the regions of Ireland is a key policy priority of this Government.</p>  <p>  We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.</p>  <p>  For the State as a whole, since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) (Q1 2015 to Q3 2018) there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment, with 163,500 of these located in the regions outside Co. Dublin &ndash; that&rsquo;s 3 out of every 5 jobs created.</p>  <p>  In the year from Q3 2017 &ndash; Q3 2018, just over half (51%) of the jobs created were outside of Co. Dublin.</p>  <p>  Under the RAPJ, we remain committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 percent in each region by 2020 and to bring and/or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average. </p>  <p>  CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in the Midlands Region is currently at 7.1% (Q3 2018), which is higher than the State average of 6% and continued focus is therefore required on regional enterprise development and job creation in the Midlands.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I asked the RAPJ Implementation Committees, including in the Midlands, to refresh and refocus their plans so as to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020, especially in the face of current challenges, including Brexit. This work is ongoing and is expected to conclude by year end.</p>  <p>  The Midlands has seen good progress under the RAPJ, with employment in the region increasing by 17.6% from Q1 2015 to Q3 2018. There are 19,100 more people in employment in the region from Q1 2015 to Q3 2018.</p>  <p>  Live Register numbers have fallen in all three counties (Longford, Laois, Offaly, Westmeath) in the Midlands Region in the past 12 months. In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the Midlands of 6% and 1% respectively. Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, in 2017, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have 819 client companies in the Midlands employing 4,214 people. This is an increase of 372 jobs from 2016. </p>  <p>  The Enterprise Agencies continue to work to contribute to employment and economic growth throughout all regions. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and economic growth across all regions.</p>  <p>  The LEOs continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own businesses.</p>  <p>  IDA meanwhile will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019. </p>  <p>  On Monday, under the second call my Department's Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), I announced an allocation of just over &euro;29 million in funding that will support regions throughout the country to deliver on their economic and enterprise development potential. </p>  <p>  21 projects from all over the country received funding. This is in addition to the &euro;30 million in funding under Call 1 of the REDF that I announced in December 2017 that also funded 21 projects.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-04a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400067#WRF02500"><p>As you may be aware, the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to a certain limit) on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, payment of a fuel grant, and an exemption from Motor Tax. </p><p>To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate. To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions: </p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms; </p><p>- be without one or both legs; </p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant, the scheme cost circa &euro;65 million in each of 2016 and 2017.  This figure does not include the revenue foregone in respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>Given the scale and scope of the scheme, I have no plans to amend the qualifying criteria at this time.</p></reply>

It is, of course, a criminal offence for an unauthorised firm/person to provide financial services in Ireland that would require an authorisation under the relevant legislation which the Central Bank is the responsible body for enforcing. </p><p>The Central Bank has no power or regulatory role in respect of illegal moneylenders.  Illegal moneylenders fall within the remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Central Bank is statutorily required to report any suspicions of illegal moneylending to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and does so when it becomes aware of suspected cases of illegal moneylending.  Members of the public and licensed moneylenders are encouraged to report any suspicions of illegal moneylending to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>As at 31 December 2014 there were 38 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. </p><p>As at 31 December 2015 there were 39 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. </p><p>As at 31 December 2016 there were 39 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. </p><p>As at 31 December 2017 there were 40 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. </p><p>As at 29 November 2018 there are 39 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank.</p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s public register of moneylenders sets out the District Court districts in which each licensed moneylender is permitted to operate.  Currently, 28 moneylenders are permitted to operate in all districts. S.I. 172/2013 (available on <i>www.irishstatutebook.ie</i>), sets out the up to date list of District Court districts and their related areas.</p><p>Each moneylender&rsquo;s licence (which can be found on the Central Bank&rsquo;s Register of Moneylenders, available at the following link: <i>) </i>includes details of the duration, maximum APR, maximum cost of credit and the collection charge (if any) of the loans which can be offered by a licensed moneylender.  Licensed moneylenders are prohibited from applying additional charges (other than a collection charge) to a moneylending agreement and are also prohibited from applying any additional charges in the event of a default in the payments due under the agreement (i.e., the total amount repayable by a consumer is limited to the amount specified in the moneylending agreement). </p><p>The Consumer Credit Act 1995, the legislation under which moneylenders are licensed, does not provide for an APR/interest rate cap.  Nor does the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010.  Therefore, the Central Bank has no statutory power to impose a market wide cap on rates.  Any legislative proposals in this regard would have to be careful to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit and ensure that it did not have unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion.</p><p>The legislation provides that the Central Bank can refuse to grant a licence to a moneylender if it is of the opinion that the cost of credit to be charged is excessive.  Since the Central Bank assumed responsibility for the licensed moneylending sector in 2003, it has not permitted an increase to the maximum APR charged in the sector.  During the Central Bank&rsquo;s engagements with new or potential applicants, it examines, on a case-by-case basis, if the proposed costs of credit are excessive and it has successfully challenged firms in this regard.  Nor has the Bank licensed any moneylender to provide the &lsquo;pay-day loan&rsquo; services that exist in other jurisdictions such as the UK and the Bank will continue to pursue this policy.</p><p>The Central Bank has stated its view publicly that the introduction of an interest rate ceiling may not achieve the objective of lowering the total cost of credit, for example if the licensed moneylender chose instead to extend the duration of the loan.  Any legislative proposals in this regard would therefore have to be careful to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit.  Lower interest rate ceilings could be ineffective and counterproductive in this regard and may result in excluding low income households that have repayment capacity from accessing such credit, even at the high rates charged by licensed moneylenders.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-04a.51.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400067#WRF05200"><p>Section 38 1(a) of the Credit Union Act 1997 prescribes that the interest on a Credit Union loan shall not at any time exceed 1% per month.  I can confirm that the power to increase this cap has not been vested in the Central Bank and therefore whether the 1% per month interest limit for the credit union sector should be increased is a matter for the Minister for Finance, Government and the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware the interest rate ceiling on Credit Union loans has been subject to recent discussion in a number of fora.</p>  <p>  Firstly, the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) - the statutory committee whose function is to advise the Minister for Finance in relation to matters relating to credit unions - published a policy paper on this issue in December 2017 following a survey of credit unions.  In its policy paper on the loan interest rate cap the CUAC recommended that credit unions should be permitted to charge an interest rate on loans greater than the present ceiling of 1% per month, and proposed that the cap be raised to 2% per month.  This change would provide credit unions with greater flexibility to risk price loan products and in so doing may create an opportunity for new product offerings. It is important to note that CUAC's recommendation to increase the loan interest rate ceiling would not mean that credit unions are required to raise their loan interest rates, rather they could apply their own interest rates within the parameters allowed.  The policy paper is available on my Department's website.  </p>  <p>  Secondly, the CUAC Report Implementation Group - a group established to oversee and monitor the implementation of recommendations from the CUAC report - has also considered the issue of the increasing the interest rate cap as recommended in the CUAC policy paper.  This group is chaired by my Department and is made up of one member from each of the credit union representative bodies - the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers&rsquo; Association and the National Supervisors Forum - and a member from the Central Bank.  The Implementation Group is currently in the process of finalising its Final Report which will be published shortly.  Following publication of the Final Report, I will review the Implementation Group's recommendation on the loan interest cap, along with the CUAC recommendation already received, and consider if any legislative changes are required.   </p>  <p>  Finally, I should also note that the CUAC recommendation on the interest rate cap is aligned with a similar recommendation that has been put forward recently in the "Interest Rate Restrictions on Credit for Low-income Borrowers" report, compiled by the Centre for Co-operative Studies University College Cork on behalf of the Social Finance Foundation.</p></reply>

The SBCI is Ireland&rsquo;s national promotional institution for SMEs.  The SBCI does not provide financing directly to SMEs, rather, it uses an on-lending model and works with both banks and non-bank finance providers to make lower-cost finance available to eligible enterprises. The SBCI currently has 3 bank and 3 non-bank on-lenders. </p>  <p>  The strategic mission of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs.  The SBCI achieves this through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk-sharing activities, which involve the provision of guarantees.  To date, none of the SBCI&rsquo;s funding has been used to support a specific credit insurance product; rather, as I mentioned, it provides guarantees to and engages in the sharing of risk with its partner finance providers, as well as the State and European partners. </p>  <p>  In respect of the figures sought by the Deputy, I am advised that the SBCI does not obtain details of the number of applications for loans made to its on-lending partners and does not receive loan applications directly from SMEs, due to its on-lending model. Instead, the SBCI only obtains information from its on-lending partners in respect of the number of loans to SMEs that have been sanctioned. </p>  <p>  At the end of March 2018, the total volume of SBCI supported lending activity through eight on-lending partners, including loans made under the SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee schemes, was &euro;972 million to over 24,000 SMEs supporting 129,300. </p>  <p>  The Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme are the SBCI&rsquo;s two major risk-sharing guarantee Schemes. </p>  <p>  Under the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme, which has now concluded, a total of approximately &euro;145 million of loans were drawn down by over 4,200 SMES.  These loans were made available through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. SMEs applied directly to those banks for loan approval and these applications were subject to the banks&rsquo; normal credit assessment processes.</p>  <p>  Up to &euro;300 million of funding to SMEs and small MidCaps is currently available under the Brexit Loan Scheme.  There is a two-stage application process for this funding.  First, businesses must apply to the SBCI to confirm their eligibility for the Scheme.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges.  The SBCI has advised me that it deals with these eligibility applications within 24 hours.  Then, loans are subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures. The Scheme is available through the AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. </p>  <p>  Since the launch of the Brexit Loan Scheme on 28 March 2018 to 23 November 2018, the SBCI has received 307 applications.  Of these, 270 have been deemed eligible to proceed to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the Scheme.  In total, 54 SMEs have progressed to sanction at partner finance provider level to a total value of &euro;12,510,000.</p>  <p>  The SBCI also operates the Credit Guarantee Scheme on behalf of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. In the last two years, loans of &euro;28.7 million have been supported under the Scheme providing funding to 190 SMEs. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises&rdquo; applies to applications made to the SBCI&rsquo;s on-lenders that are regulated entities by the Central Bank of Ireland.  This Code requires the finance providers to set out their timelines for dealing with loan applications, which vary depending on the size of the loan.</p></reply>

That is why, as part of Budget 2019, I secured &euro;10 million in additional funding to allow the Agency to roll out the next phase of its Regional Property Programme. This brings the Agency's total Exchequer allocation for property next year up to &euro;47m and means that the IDA will have further resources to continue investing in strategic sites, upgrading business parks and constructing buildings across the country. That should help to attract more overseas firms to regional locations and thereby create new employment opportunities. </p><p>Whilst the IDA is doing everything within its power to ensure its clients locate outside the country&rsquo;s principal urban areas, attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to the regions is not without its challenges. Many overseas firms, for example, will only consider large cities where there is ready access to transport hubs. Companies also often want to be located near competitors or clusters of other similar enterprises, which means they are more likely to decide to situate themselves in urban areas. </p><p>Despite those challenges, real progress is being made in increasing levels of FDI in the regions. In 2017, for example, 70% of all jobs created were outside Dublin, including 45% of all jobs created by IDA clients. Similarly, 65% of all Enterprise Ireland client employment is outside Dublin. This year, meanwhile, has seen a number of very high-profile investments in the regions, including in counties Longford, Sligo and Louth. We are working hard, across Government, to build on that progress and ensure further projects are secured for regional Ireland in the coming years. </p><p>I want to stress too that IDA Ireland does its utmost to encourage clients to locate in areas that are most in need of investment. While the final decision is always for the company in question itself to take, the Agency makes a particular effort to promote regional locations. This is reflected in site visit statistics for the first three quarters of 2018, where over half of the total number of 461 visits were to regional areas. A breakdown of site visits this year is set out in the table. </p><p>It should also be noted that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. My Department, and its Agencies, work together constantly to ensure that jobs and investment &ndash; whether driven by FDI or indigenous firms &ndash; are spread as fairly as possible across Ireland. </p><p><b>Appendix A - Site Visits by County 2017 to Q1 2018</b></p><p><i>Note: Potential clients visiting Ireland may visit more than one county and may return to a location more than once.

That is why significant resources have been invested into this area, including through the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan which includes financing measures, new construction and rental sector improvements. These steps will, first and foremost, ensure that people in Ireland are better able to buy and rent suitable homes. They will also serve to reinforce our national infrastructure in terms of its capacity to accommodate further foreign direct investment.</p>  <p>  More broadly, it is important to bear in mind that international investors take a long-term view on where they choose to establish a presence. Investors also use a wide range of criteria to inform such decisions. Our traditional strengths are well known &ndash; including our talented workforce, membership of the EU and pro-enterprise policy environment &ndash; and these critical factors continue, as the healthy pipeline of investment here demonstrates, to make the country an attractive proposition to overseas firms. </p>  <p>  We should not forget either that many of the States that we compete with for investment have challenges of their own &ndash; including in housing &ndash; when it comes to attracting overseas firms. So while we have infrastructural areas in this country that need further investment and improvement, we are not alone in facing that challenge. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is fully seized of current housing market conditions in Ireland and recognises that this is an important issue for investors. I myself regularly engage with the IDA - as well as businesses themselves - about the enterprise climate in the country, including with respect to infrastructural issues. I understand that the Agency&rsquo;s assessments of the housing market are based on a wide range of sources and a combination of indices, with the aim of forming the clearest possible picture of how Irish rents compare internationally. These information sources are continuously reviewed and contribute to briefings used by IDA staff. It should be remembered too that the overseas firms that the IDA targets to invest in Ireland &ndash; many of whom are large multinational companies with an existing presence here &ndash; form their own opinions on housing supply and other investment conditions here. </p>  <p>  The briefing documents in question highlight a number of indices regarding the Irish property market. They include a 2018 Residential Tenancies Board figure on average rents in Dublin City. Another index, which was sourced from the Nestpick 2017 Furnished Apartment Index, set out an estimate of the costs of renting small furnished apartments across County Dublin in 2017.  I understand that it was not suggested by the IDA that this Nestpick index was an authoritative figure for the entire Dublin property market. Similarly, I understands that the IDA has never advised its staff to underestimate average rents in Ireland to potential investors. </p></reply>

In order to implement these measures, the Government agreed that it would support and amend the Prohibition of Above Cost Ticket Touting Bill introduced in January 2017 by Deputy Noel Rock and Deputy Stephen Donnelly and would take the second and subsequent stages of the Bill in Government time. The proposed legislation would ban the resale of tickets above their face value in designated venues with a capacity of 1,000 or over. The use of bot software to purchase tickets in excess of the number permitted by event organisers would also be prohibited. In addition, the legislation will give effect to the commitment given to UEFA to ban the unauthorised transfer and use of tickets for matches and official events taking place in Ireland during the EURO 2020 Championship.  </p>  <p>  While the Bill introduced by Deputies Rock and Donnelly was scheduled to have its second reading on 21 November, it did not prove possible to have the Second Stage debate on that date. I very much hope that the second reading of the Bill will proceed as soon as possible and look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies to the debate on the Bill. My officials have meanwhile been working on a range of amendments and additions to the Private Members' Bill and expect to be in a position to submit these formally to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel later this month. When finalised, the Government amendments will then be tabled at the Bill's Committee or Report Stage.   </p></reply>

It is key to maintaining competitiveness for Ireland in global markets, and for providing jobs and sustaining growth across the whole of the economy, including in the manufacturing and services sectors.  </p>  <p>  In 2018, Ireland rose to 9th place in the European Innovation Scorecard. We also retained our position in the Global Innovation Index, ranking 10th out of 126 countries.</p>  <p>  Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology articulates Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to become a Global Innovation Leader, identifying several priority areas including &lsquo;Advanced and Smart Manufacturing&rsquo;, &lsquo;Manufacturing and Novel Materials&rsquo; and &lsquo;Innovation in Services and Business Processes&rsquo; as being particularly important for the Irish economy. The priority areas and themes were updated to reflect the impact of technological change and digitisation of the manufacturing and services sectors.</p>  <p>  Recognising Ireland&rsquo;s continued economic growth and prosperity depends on maintaining and indeed increasing investment across the broad science, technology and innovation spectrum.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s 2019 innovation budget has been increased to &euro;368.95m &ndash; an increase of &euro;40.25m over 2018 to be spent over a range of initiatives and programmes that advance innovation and facilitate opportunities for Irish interests on EU and world markets.  Of particular relevance is the allocation of &euro;20m for Phase I of the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund, which has a total fund of &euro;500m as set out in Project Ireland 2040.  Included also is an additional &euro;10m in 2019 as part of a &euro;100m dedicated PhD/Masters training programme through Science Foundation Ireland in areas aligned to enterprise needs.</p>  <p>  Significant investments are also being made to develop the national ecosystem of research and technology centres in priority areas including that of manufacturing through Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. Two SFI Research Centres have a manufacturing focus, with &ldquo;CONFIRM&rdquo; focussing on smart manufacturing involving convergence of IT and industrial automation systems and &ldquo;I-FORM&rdquo; focussing on additive manufacturing.  The focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Irish Manufacturing Research (IMR) Centre is Advanced Manufacturing. IMR is a one stop shop where manufacturing companies both multinational and indigenous, can collaborate to solve big manufacturing challenges in partnership with Irish and EU researchers. </p>  <p>  My Department, along with the Department of the Taoiseach, is currently developing the Future Jobs Initiative, a new cross-Government strategy to guide the next phase of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development.  The focus is on quality jobs, improving productivity and building a resilient and innovative economy.  Innovation and technological change is one of the five key pillars and this focus will have a positive impact on the development of both the manufacturing and services sectors.</p></reply>

In 2017, Enterprise Ireland reported job increases of 7% in the North West and by 5% in the North-East; while IDA reported increases of 4% across the Border region.</p><p>Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) across the Border Region (Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan) have 944 client companies employing 4,920 people.</p><p>I am happy to say that in Budget 2019, I secured an increase in my Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m.</p><p>This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes:</p><p>- an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on this year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and</p><p>- an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m.</p><p>Regional development was one of my three main priorities for Budget 2019 and I approved a range of measures to drive indigenous enterprise development and regional growth. </p><p>I allocated an extra &euro;5m to the 31 LEOs, up 22% on 2018, which have a presence in every county, to support start-ups and growth and in particular to support businesses to prepare for Brexit. This will include a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, to be rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>I was also pleased to announce an allocation of &euro;10m to the next phase of the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme. Project Ireland 2040 names the Border and Midlands regions as priority areas for this Programme, and so the funding will be used to start building advanced facilities in a number of regional locations, including in Sligo and Monaghan. </p><p>IDA Ireland is working to promote Sligo and the whole Border region to a range of potential investors, but especially in the areas of global business services, research and innovation and high-tech manufacturing. </p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises.</p><p>Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence. </p><p>In addition, I also secured funding for a new phase of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme out to 2024. The new scheme, which is worth &euro;175m, will be oriented towards seed and early stage investments, where there is a very clear market failure.</p><p>I announced an additional &euro;1.8m investment for the Design Craft Council of Ireland (DCCOI) which will assist craft enterprises all over the country to drive export sales, grow online revenue opportunities, and increase market diversification so as to underpin sustainable growth. </p><p>Finally, I announced a &euro;300m Future Growth Loan Scheme for loans of up to 10 years. The Scheme has been developed by my Department with the European Investment Bank Group, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of Finance together with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. </p><p>This Scheme is crucial as it will provide businesses the opportunity to borrow for up to ten years to support capital investment. It addresses the lack of availability of loans in the marketplace for loan-terms of longer than five-to-seven years. </p><p>Earlier this year I asked the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) Implementation Committees, including in the North-West and North-East, to refresh and refocus their plans so as to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020, especially in the face of current challenges, including Brexit. This work is ongoing and is expected to conclude by year end.</p><p>On Monday, under the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), I announced an allocation of just over &euro;29 million in funding that will support regions throughout the country to deliver on their economic and enterprise development potential. </p><p>21 projects from all over the country received funding. This is in addition to the &euro;30 million in funding under Call 1 of the REDF that I announced in December 2017 that also funded 21 projects. The REDF is being rolled out by my Department, through Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>Over the first and second calls under the REDF, the North-East/North-West Region secured funding of over &euro;10.6 million across seven projects.</p><p>The projects I announced under Call 2 on Monday were:</p><p>1. &euro;953,640 for Leitrim Food Enterprise Zone: at Drumshanbo, Co. Leitrim.</p><p>2. &euro;1.9 million for a digital/tech enterprise hub in Sligo for entrepreneurs in digital gaming and associated tech sectors providing holistic support for start-up, innovation and growth.</p><p>3. &euro;4.9 million for a 'Bioconnect' Biotechnology Innovation Centre: for cutting edge biotechnology research in Monaghan and the wider Region.</p><p>4. &euro;250,000 to establish an Engineering Network of companies and local stakeholders in the North-East to safeguard and future develop the engineering sector.</p><p>These projects are in addition to the funding received under Call 1 which I announced last year, including:</p><p>&euro;1.2 million for the development of a network of three Digital and Innovation Hubs in Counties Leitrim, Cavan and Longford; &euro;1.1 million for the creation of an innovation ecosystem in Inishowen, Co Donegal; and &euro;202,800 for the development of a Regional Food Centre of Excellence in Monaghan.</p><p>These initiatives will support Border region to deliver on its economic and enterprise development potential.</p></reply>

This has been a key priority for the body since the decision by the UK to leave the European Union in June 2016. </p>  <p>  One of the principal means through which ITI is assisting businesses in preparing for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union is the body&rsquo;s Brexit Advisory Service. Established in May 2017, it provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships that may arise. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. ITI also offers a "Start to Plan" voucher, worth up to &euro;2250 each, which helps companies to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for Brexit. To date, over 600 vouchers have been approved for companies and there have been over 750 enquiries to the Brexit Advisory Service.</p>  <p>  ITI are planning to expand its range of Brexit supports in 2019. The new initiatives will include a &lsquo;&lsquo;Start to Act&rsquo; voucher, valued at &euro;5,000. The Brexit Advisory Service will also increase its digital learning delivery, making content available in an online training environment that can be conveniently accessed by SMEs. </p>  <p>  To support this important work, my Department will provide an additional &euro;1 million in capital funding to ITI in 2019. This funding will enable the body to engage with more of the companies that are seeking its support through the Brexit Advisory Service, as well as meeting demand for existing programmes which are all designed to promote and support cross-border trade.</p>  <p>  As regards our wider efforts to help enterprise prepare for Brexit, significant additional financial resources have been provided to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department for 2019. This includes &euro;5 million in further funding for the local enterprise offices to increase their Brexit supports to businesses in every county.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that our preparations for Brexit remain an absolute priority for my Department. I know how important it is that businesses, across the country, are as best equipped as possible for the challenges that Brexit will present. All the agencies and bodies under my Department will continue to focus on this work into 2019 and beyond.</p></reply>

On the contrary, Ireland fully supports and implements all EU controls on the export of surveillance software to countries outside of the EU.</p>  <p>  The EU operates an export control regime designed to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to support regional stability and to protect human rights. My Department is the national competent authority with responsibility for implementing Council Regulation 4028/2009 setting up a Union regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items. </p>  <p>  Dual-use items are goods and technology that have both civil and military applications. A range of cyber-surveillance technologies fall within the scope of this regulation, including Internet Protocol (IP) network communications surveillance systems or equipment; Telecommunications interception and monitoring equipment; and Intrusion Software. In particular, an export licence is required before these items can be exported to countries outside of the EU. </p>  <p>  When assessing a licence application, my Department takes into consideration a number of criteria as set out in the Dual-use regulation, including human rights in the destination country. My Department consults with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in this regard.</p>  <p>  The EU implements over thirty sanctions regimes targeting specific countries and entities as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. A key objective of EU sanctions regimes is to support democracy and human rights around the world. My Department is responsible for implementing trade-related sanctions and a number of these include prohibitions on the export of cyber-surveillance technologies to the targeted countries.</p>  <p>  Ireland is strongly committed to the protection of human rights; it is a cornerstone of our Foreign Policy. Ireland has long been at the forefront of global efforts to promote Human Rights. Ireland is strongly committed to the universality, indivisibility and inter-relatedness of all Human Rights, as set out in the corpus of UN and EU treaties, covenants and protocols. Ireland is actively working with the UN, NGOs and through its overseas development programme, Irish Aid, to promote and protect Human Rights.</p>  <p>  In September 2016 the European Commission published its proposal for a revision of the 2009 Dual-use regulation. The proposal incorporates additional EU controls on the export of cyber-surveillance technologies. This is a complex document with potentially far-reaching implications. In January 2018 the European Parliament put forward 98 amendments to the Commission's proposal. The Commission's proposal and the Parliament's amendments are currently under consideration in the European Council's Working Party on Dual-use Goods. Ireland is cooperating with other Member States to ensure that the revised regulation will be effective and proportionate.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has responsibility for the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund<i></i>while the Minister for Rural and Community Development has responsibility for the<i></i>Rural Regeneration and Development Fund.  </p><p>The Rural and Urban Funds complement well the &euro;60m Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), which I, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, am leading in my Department. I announced the second round of successful applicants for the REDF yesterday, 3rd December, which are in addition to the 21 successful projects I announced in December 2017 under the first REDF call for proposals.</p><p>I understand that the qualification criteria and programme monitoring arrangements for each of the Rural and Urban funds have been developed by the respective Departments, in order to align with the National Strategic Objectives as set out in Project Ireland 2040. Details of the qualification criteria for the two funds are set out on the relevant websites (<i></i>and <i></i>). The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Rural and Community Development have oversight of the funds and have established the financial governance and project reporting requirements for applicants. </p><p>My Department is represented on the Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board, which oversees the implementation of Project Ireland 2040. The Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board has a high-level oversight role and is not responsible for individual funding decisions. Furthermore, my Department was represented on a 'Project Advisory Board' for both funds, which were established to assist the relevant Departments in assessing proposals received against the criteria outlined in the funds' supporting information documents.</p><p>I welcome both of these initiatives and am encouraged by the quality of the projects announced so far. From my Department's perspective, Enterprise 2025 Renewed - Ireland's National Enterprise Policy highlights the strong interdependence between the development of attractive urban and rural environments and where companies choose to establish, invest and create jobs. Such 'place-making' is a key element to ensuring communities across Ireland are attractive for Irish and foreign-owned businesses to invest in, and for people to live in. Both the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund<i></i>and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund will provide valuable contributions towards achieving this goal.</p></reply>

This includes Counties Galway and Roscommon, which the IDA markets as part of the West region.  </p><p>There are approximately 19,000 people employed in 85 foreign direct investment companies across Galway and Roscommon. From 2015 to 2017, FDI employment in Galway increased by 15% with 2,329 net new jobs added. In Roscommon meanwhile, FDI employment increased by 13% with 134 new jobs added by IDA client companies in the same period. Information on the number of jobs created in 2018 will not be available until my Department carries out its Annual Employment Survey (AES) at the end of this year.</p><p>The IDA is authorised by my Department to provide a range of financial supports to its client companies in the form of employment, capital, research and development, environmental and training grants. These grants are an important means of encouraging companies to invest in Ireland, particularly in regional locations. From 2015 to 2017, IDA Ireland paid a total of &euro;39,650,095 to its client companies in Galway and &euro;918,500 to its clients in Roscommon. Grant payment figures are released on an annual basis and information on the total paid to IDA client companies in 2018 will be made available once they have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  </p><p>The IDA continues to promote Galway and Roscommon to a range of potential investors in order to encourage further investment and job creation. As part of that effort, the IDA regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in both counties, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. </p><p>While we have made progress in helping to generate new economic opportunities in Galway and Roscommon, we are determined to achieve more.

Figures show that employment continues to grow strongly with 66,700 jobs created in the year from Q3 2017 to Q3 2018. This brings total employment to 2,273,200. </p>  <p>  The number of people in employment has increased in six of the eight regions in the year from Q3 2017 to Q3 2018. The exception to this is the Mid-West (which has remained static) and the Border region.</p>  <p>  In the West Region, in the year to Q3 2018, an extra 5,100 people were in employment. In the same period, there were 1,100 fewer people unemployed in the Region. </p>  <p>  Since becoming Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have made regional development my top priority. Indeed, enterprise development and job creation in the regions of Ireland is a key policy priority of this Government.</p>  <p>  We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.</p>  <p>  Under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) we committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 percent in each region by 2020 and to bring and/or maintain unemployment levels in each  region to within at least one percentage point of the State average.   </p>  <p>  Since the launch of the RAPJ there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment across the State since Q1 2015 to Q3 2018, with 163,500 people in the regions outside Dublin entering employment in that period.</p>  <p>  That is over 63% - or 3 out of every 5 jobs created &ndash; for regions outside of Co. Dublin (Q1 2015 &ndash; Q3 2018). </p>  <p>  In the year from Q3 2017 &ndash; Q3 2018, just over half (51%) of the jobs created were outside of Co. Dublin.</p>  <p>  The West has seen good progress under the RAPJ, with employment in the region increasing by 15.7% from Q1 2015 to Q3 2018. There are 28,400 more people in employment in the region from Q1 2015 to Q3 2018.</p>  <p>  Live Register numbers have fallen in all three counties in the West Region in the past 12 months.</p>  <p>  CSO figures show that the unemployment rate in the West Region is currently at 6.6% (Q3 2018), which is slightly higher than the State average but is within one percentage point of the State average. </p>  <p>  The Enterprise Agencies continue to work to contribute to employment and economic growth throughout all regions. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2017-2020 aims to create a further 60,000 jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and economic growth across all regions.</p>  <p>  In 2017, both Enterprise Ireland and IDA reported job increases in the West of 7% and 5% respectively. Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in 2017, had 628 client companies in the West employing 3,057 people. This is an increase of 152 jobs from 2016. </p>  <p>  IDA meanwhile will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin to 2019. </p>  <p>  The West Region Action Plan for Jobs has been a key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Midlands, working with public and private stakeholders. In April of this year, I met with the Chairs of all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs committees and other regional stakeholders, to start a process to Refresh and Refocus all Regional Plans, including the West Region Plan, to ensure their effectiveness, relevance and impact out to 2020, particularly in light of Brexit. This work is ongoing at present and the Plans are due to be completed by the end of the year. </p>  <p>  On Monday, under the second call of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), I announced an allocation of just over &euro;29 million in funding that will support regions throughout the country to deliver on their economic and enterprise development potential. </p>  <p>  21 projects from all over the country received funding. This is in addition to the &euro;30 million in funding under Call 1 of the REDF that I announced in December 2017 that also funded 21 projects. The REDF is being rolled out by my Department, through Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  Over the first and seconds calls under the REDF, the West Region secured funding of over &euro;7.1 million across four projects.</p>  <p>  Under Call 2 of the REDF I announced:</p>  <p>  - &euro;2.4 million for Galway City Innovation District to provide coworking space, private office space and event space for scaleup companies and a landing site for FDI companies.</p>  <p>  - &euro;2 million for the development of a market-focused Marine Innovation and Development Centre at Midc P&aacute;irc Na Mara.</p>  <p>  - &euro;182,786 for the Burren Lowlands project that will create a focus point for the development of activities to create and attract additional jobs to this area.</p>  <p>  These three projects are in addition to the funding received by the BIA Innovator Campus under the first call, which will support food entrepreneurship in the West.</p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (NPF), as part of Project Ireland 2040, aims to guide the future development of Ireland over the next 20+ years, and to influence the spatial patterns of a projected 1 million increase in our population. The NPF and the 10-year National Development Plan have been developed in alignment with each other in order to explicitly link spatial planning policy and infrastructure capital investment. Taken together, will help unlock the potential in the regions. </p>  <p>  The Government is focused on unlocking the potential in the regions. Co-ordinated delivery of infrastructure, at the same time as enabling regional enterprise development under Project Ireland 2040, should help to better distribute our future anticipated population growth across the whole country &ndash; while also tackling congestion and quality of life issues. </p>  <p>  The next step in the delivery of the National Planning Framework involves the development of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) for each of three regions (Eastern-Midlands, Southern, North-Western). These will provide a statement of regional ambition and articulate the unique characteristics of each region, with a focus on the interaction between spatial policy and enterprise opportunities. </p>  <p>  My Department, and the enterprise development agencies, have been engaging pro-actively with each of the Regional Assemblies to ensure that national enterprise and innovation policies are reflected in the draft strategies. It is our view that the RSESs should have a focus on &lsquo;place-making&rsquo; to facilitate the creation of concentrated settlements, in which people can live and work in a vibrant environment, and public services can be efficiently provided as envisaged by the Ireland 2040 plan. We know that there is a strong interdependence between the planning and development of attractive places and where companies will choose to establish, invest and create jobs.</p></reply>

I have also prioritised Brexit preparedness as one of my three main priorities, alongside regional growth and innovation. I am confident that SMEs in Co. Cork and throughout the country will be best placed to meet the challenges ahead.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 provided over &euro;110 million for additional Brexit preparedness resources and initiatives across government departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are participating in the new cross-government awareness campaign &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; with events in Cork, Galway, Monaghan and Dublin in October and Limerick and Donegal last month.  </p>  <p>  Over 3,000 businesses have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of Enterprise Ireland's client firms are now taking Brexit related actions, such as diversifying their export markets, improving operational competitiveness, and investing in research and development. </p>  <p>  I have provided funding for 98 additional staff for the agencies and regulatory bodies under the remit of my Department to date in order to prepare Irish businesses for Brexit. In addition, I am providing an additional &euro;8 million for 2019, for my Department, as well as its agencies and regulatory bodies to continue the work on our Brexit response and increasing our global footprint.   </p>  <p>  The additional work of my Department's agencies such as the Health and Safety Authority and the National Standards Authority of Ireland is particularly important in helping businesses prepare for a worst-case scenario. I am providing an additional &euro;1 million to InterTrade Ireland for 2019 to expand their essential work in providing support and advice to businesses to sustain cross-border trade and on the specific issues relating to potential tariffs under a reversion to World Trade Organisation (WTO) regime. </p>  <p>  In relation to any new customs arrangements, Enterprise Ireland and Revenue are working closely on the design and development of an on-line platform on future customs requirements for when the UK leaves the EU and becomes a third country. This will be rolled-out from early 2019 to all importers and exporters, including those in Co. Cork, through the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs).</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware that in the event of a worst-case scenario, access to finance and liquidity may become issues of concern for exporting businesses in particular. I am working with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, on the roll-out of a new &euro;300 million Brexit Long Term loan scheme, to come into effect from early 2019, to provide loans of up to 10 years. </p>  <p>  The Brexit Working Capital Loan Scheme which I launched earlier this year provides affordable working capital to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees that are, or will be, impacted by Brexit and meet the scheme criteria. As at 23 November 2018 there had been 307 applications for eligibility, of which 270 were approved ranging from agri-food, retail and distribution, manufacturing, hospitality and transport sectors. 54 loans have progressed to sanction at the finance provider level, to a total value of &euro;12.51 million.</p>  <p>  My Department is also continuing to work with the European Commission in relation to State aid flexibilities. Specifically in May this year I agreed a temporary restructuring aid scheme with the Commission, which is in addition to the rescue and restructuring scheme agreed in 2017.</p></reply>

The Department regrets these unacceptable delays, and those involved are working hard to bring processing times back to within our customer service target times.</p>  <p>  Through a combination of additional resources, fast-tracked training for new processors and various operational and ICT improvements, processing times are now reducing.  Trusted Partner processing times have reduced to 5 weeks (from a peak of 7 weeks) and Standard application processing times have reduced to 11 weeks (from a peak of 16 weeks).  This is still well below the previous average timeframe of 2 weeks for Trusted Partner applications and 4 weeks for general applications, but compares with international norms.</p>  <p>  Further reductions in processing times are anticipated in the coming weeks as the changes being implemented by my officials continue to show results. I am determined to bring employment permit processing times back to within our customer service targets as soon as possible and I regret any inconvenience caused to businesses and potential employees in the meantime.</p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List (HSEOL) and the Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL). These occupations lists are reviewed twice yearly to keep pace with rapid labour market changes and to be proactively identifying and addressing shortages as they arise.  My Department has commenced the Quarter 4 2018 review of the lists of occupations for employment permits with a public call for submissions from stakeholders and interest groups requesting changes to the lists. The closing date for receipt of submissions was Friday 2nd November 2018. Submissions have been received in respect of a range of occupations and those submissions are now being examined.</p>  <p>  In light of the changing economy and as we continue towards near full employment, it is imperative that the employment permits system is correctly oriented to meet the State&rsquo;s labour market needs.  To that end, I recently published a report reviewing the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system to ensure our policies are fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in certain sectors.  The report confirms that our employment permits system is largely robust with some adjustment required to ensure continued responsiveness so that our employment permits system will play its part in supporting Ireland's labour market needs.  An Action Plan has been drawn up to implement the Report&rsquo;s recommendations with a specified timeframes.  Some actions can be achieved in the short term, others will require further work and some will need legislative change</p></reply>

Information on the fund and how to apply was provided by my Department with the support of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland. Expressions of Interest were sought for funding commencing in 2019. Subsequent calls will be announced in due course. </p>  <p>  My Department received over 300 Expressions of Interest for this first call for funding. All of these represented collaborations of two or more partners with at least one SME in each partnership. As you know, the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund is a competitive offer and all applications for funding under this first call are subject to the same assessment and selection criteria. </p>  <p>  In line with what was agreed by Government in May 2018 for all departments involved in running National Development Plan (NDP) Funds, my Department appointed an Advisory Board with civil servants and relevant experts from the sector as members. Accordingly, an Advisory Board chaired by the Department and comprised of nominated members of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, along with nominated members of other Government Departments and public sector organisations was appointed to oversee the assessment and selection process of the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund. A panel of independent international experts comprised of both technical and commercialisation experts was also formed to assess applications.</p>  <p>  Under Call 1, all the Expression of Interest (EOI) forms were screened for eligibility. Only eligible applications were put forward for assessment by the Advisory Board and the panel of experts. Assessment of these eligible applications was based on the selection criteria set out in the guidelines for this fund, but briefly they are: 1.) the strength of the disruptive technology dimension; 2.) economic and market impact of the proposal; 3.) the quality and efficiency of the collaboration; and 4.) the overall excellence of the proposed approach.</p>  <p>  Decisions on Expressions of Interest were made in September 2018 and were communicated to the lead partner of all collaborations. Only those applicants that met all of the eligibility criteria and met the minimum threshold of the Selection Criteria were invited to submit a full application. Projects that are deemed ineligible for this first call under the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund (DTIF) may still be able to apply in subsequent calls. </p>  <p>  45 consortia were invited to submit a full application to be received by 12.00 noon on 5th November. Since that date, the panel of international experts has been assessing the detailed applications against the same selection criteria as set out above and interviewing each consortium that submitted a valid application.</p>  <p>  The DTIF Advisory Board has met in recent days to review the outcome of the international assessment of the projects and I will be provided with the recommendations of the Advisory Board in the near future.  I expect to make an announcement about the first tranche of projects to receive an offer of DTIF funding later in December.</p></reply>

These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months. </p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. A &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; event was recently held in Monaghan in October and I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready event in Letterkenny in Donegal on Friday 30 November last, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA.   </p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland (ITI) works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. </p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships on account of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management.</p>  <p>  ITI also offers vouchers which enable companies to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in the Border Regions are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, 263 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.</p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.</p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. </p>  <p>  Yesterday, in Meath, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). Taking the first and second calls of the REDF together, the Border Region had seven successful projects with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million. This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region. </p>  <p>The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.      </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) is also actively engaging with companies in the Border Region.  The Agency recently met with the Killybegs Harbour Group which is a mix of industries and companies and explained the suite of supports available.</p>  <p>  In November, EI ran a Spotlight on Skills Workshop in Carrickmacross, Monaghan. The aim of the Spotlight on Skills Workshops is to assist client companies to identify their critical skills needs, and to support the growth of their businesses. </p>  <p>  EI also recently supported the Enterprise Europe Network Meet the Buyer event focused on Engineering Companies in the Border Region. The event, organised out of Donegal Local Enterprise Office (LEO) office, took place in Combilift in Monaghan and was attended by a mix of EI, LEO and Invest NI Clients. </p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want business, particularly around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. </p></reply>

It is a competitive industry, and the best way for Ireland to win business is for companies to pool resources and create entities that will enable members to bid for contracts that are not possible on an individual basis.  This is the model that Emerald Aero Cluster has adopted.</p>  <p>  The Emerald Aero Cluster was approved for funding under the first call of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund. The Cluster is comprised of 14 indigenous manufacturing companies and is working to develop Ireland &ndash; and the Mid-West region in particular &ndash;  as a hub for excellence in global aerospace manufacturing. </p>  <p>  The Cluster has made good progress to-date having succeeded in winning numerous high value contracts for its members and attended international trade shows. The cluster has recruited a number of specialist consultants in the key territories of France, Germany, UK, and USA to target key industry opportunities across a number of key segments of the industry.</p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing the further progress this cluster of innovative companies make in the future.</p></reply>

I intend to bring a General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to that action to Government shortly. </p><p>Changing the structure of the ODCE from an office to a statutory agency will provide greater autonomy to the agency in relation to staffing resources and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law. Sourcing of expertise and specialist staff, such as forensic accountants, will be enhanced under the agency model.</p><p>This establishment of the ODCE as an Agency is intended to:</p><p>- Enhance the ODCE&rsquo;s independence, by providing it with more autonomy, particularly the ability to recruit the required specialist skills and expertise; </p><p>- Build on its existing expertise and experience; </p><p>- Strengthen its capability to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law; and</p><p>- Build on the organisational and procedural reforms that have been implemented.</p><p>Organisational reforms in the ODCE were commenced in 2012 to enhance the capability of the Office to investigate complex breaches of company law and to ensure a more efficient and effective use of its resources.  These include:</p><p>- Reorganising the structure of the Office;</p><p>- Recruiting additional expertise, including 8 Forensic Accountants, a Digital Forensic Specialist, 2 Enforcement Portfolio Managers and 2 Enforcement Lawyers;</p><p>- As senior-level vacancies have arisen, reconfiguration of the skill sets, competencies, roles and responsibilities associated with those posts to better reflect the organisation's current needs;  </p><p>- Amending the investigative procedures used by the Office so that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take the lead in all criminal investigations; and</p><p>- Fostering a greater culture of risk management within the Office.</p></reply>

Ireland continues to perform very strongly in terms of attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and encouraging further FDI from multinational companies remains a major priority of mine.  </p><p>The pipeline of FDI into Dublin continues to be very strong. There are currently 735 FDI companies operating in the County, employing over 88,000 people. From 2016 to 2017, FDI-driven employment in Dublin increased by 7.8%, with approximately 6,400 new jobs added. The County remains highly attractive to overseas investors on account of many factors, including its proven track record as a successful home to multinational firms.</p><p>As regards Fingal and North County Dublin in particular, data on IDA Ireland site visits and job creation is collated on a county-by-county basis only.

Site visits represent a useful tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in particular locations and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that overseas firms consider all possibilities when visiting the country. Dublin has had 209 site visits so far in 2018 with 68 of these taking place in the third quarter of this year.

These supports aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months. </p><p>As part of its work in assessing where supports are most needed, my Department regularly surveys companies to determine the Brexit issues affecting them and to gauge their level of preparedness. Our most recent SME survey published earlier this year found that 44% of all businesses strongly impacted by Brexit have a plan in place &ndash; almost twice as many as a year previously. It is planned to rerun this survey early in the new year. </p><p>More recently, a survey of 2,400 Enterprise Ireland clients found that 85% of firms are taking Brexit-related actions. This is up from 38% this time last year. In the first 6 months of this year alone, 43% of the most exposed firms backed by Enterprise Ireland received grant aid. </p><p>The Government will continue to focus on our communications with enterprise to ensure that they are as informed as possible about Brexit and can take timely action to prepare.</p><p>Furthermore, I regularly meet with businesses to discuss their concerns and issues, as do officials in my Department. On an ongoing basis, I chair an Enterprise Forum on Brexit and Global Challenges which is an effective tool for ensuring open, two-way communication between Government and the enterprise community regarding Brexit issues. This Forum meets regularly and provides a vehicle for discussion of enterprise, trade and investment policy implications arising from wider global challenges, with a specific focus on Brexit.</p><p>In terms of sectors and regions of concern, my Department has undertaken a wide range of studies into the possible impacts of Brexit and a number of these have highlighted the potential regional effects associated with the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU.</p><p>Amongst a range of studies undertaken and funded by my Department, the Copenhagen Economics study &ldquo;Ireland and the impact of Brexit: Strategic implications for Ireland arising from changing EU-UK Trading Relations&rdquo;, published earlier this year, identified the most vulnerable sectors in respect of Brexit.</p><p>The study found that 5 sectors account for 90% of the possible economic impact. They are agri-food, pharma-chemicals, engineering and machinery, wholesale and retail and air transport. Around 80% of the employment in these sectors is outside the Dublin region. As noted in the study, Brexit will therefore be felt more in rural parts of the country where these sectors dominate, particularly agri-food. </p><p>From a regional perspective, the Regional Action Plan for Jobs is central to my Department&rsquo;s targeted approach to boosting regional employment. While progress has been very good, it is clear that we also have new challenges since the Regional Action Plan for Jobs process started, not least Brexit. In this context, I have asked the Implementation Committees in each region to lead a process to refresh and refocus their Plans to 2020 which will focus on building each region&rsquo;s own competitive advantage, develop areas that are already strong, examine vulnerabilities and take account of the challenges that Brexit presents.</p><p>For 2019, I am allocating an extra &euro;8 million to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department, who work with firms to develop their supports for business. I have also allocated an additional &euro;5m to the Local Enterprise Offices for 2019 to increase their Brexit supports to businesses in every county. </p><p>The level of uptake of these supports shows that businesses are aware of the assistance on offer and are engaging with various initiatives and schemes that have been made available. For instance, the EI &lsquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rsquo; is an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. To date, 2,962 Brexit Scorecards have been completed.  </p><p>Enterprise Ireland has run eight Brexit advisory clinics throughout the country to date.  Approximately 590 people have attended these events and three more clinics are due to take place before the end of the year in Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick.</p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. 3,925<b></b>participants have taken part in these events. In addition, 263<b></b>LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring<b></b>solely focused on Brexit.  </p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, launched in March this year, makes a fund of up to &euro;300 million available to eligible businesses to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenge.</p><p>While I am encouraged by the fact that businesses are engaging in high numbers with these and other supports on offer, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses to know we are here to help. It is vital that businesses take the required steps of gathering information and preparing Brexit contingency plans.</p></reply>

While these benefits are recognised as significant, the cost is also significant and must be assessed in the context of other Departmental and national investment priorities.</p>  <p>  No funding is available in current budget projections for membership in 2019, but due consideration is being given to membership in line with the Department's policy. Innovation 2020, the national strategy for research and innovation, recognises that in order for Ireland to become a Global Innovation Leader, our research and innovation system must be open with strong international collaboration links. Membership of leading international research organisations is an important mechanism for facilitating this engagement.  </p>  <p>  For this reason, the Government gave a specific commitment in Innovation 2020 to initiate discussions with a number of international research organisations. In particular, four organisations &ndash; CERN, the European Southern Observatory, ELIXIR and LOFAR - were identified and I am pleased to confirm that membership of three of these organisations has been completed.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to keep the position in relation to CERN membership, and its cost, under review and maintains contact with officials in CERN in relation to Ireland's potential membership.</p></reply>

While there is no doubt that we need to improve in some areas, I believe the levels of investment that we continue to attract here reflect the continuing confidence that international companies have in our economy and infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The current difficulties we are experiencing in our housing market, and most particularly the insufficient national supply of quality homes and apartments, are well-documented. However, overseas firms &ndash; who my Department and the IDA regularly engage with about issues that affect their capacity to invest here &ndash; understand how much of a priority the Government has placed on addressing this problem. They know that we are working hard to increase supply and that the overall national trend is now one of steady progress and improvement. </p>  <p>  The Government remains fully focused on doing everything it can to address the housing situation. That is why we published the &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan&rsquo;, which includes an array of measures to improve the availability of homes in this country. The primary objective is ensuring that people and families, across Ireland, have better access to quality and affordable housing. The work undertaken to improve housing also serves to reinforce our national infrastructure in terms of its capacity to accommodate further foreign direct investment (FDI).</p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made on the action plan. As reflected in the November Monthly Housing Activity Report, construction and housing supply are improving. There have been steady increases in the number of planning permissions, commencement notices, registrations and the availability of new houses, all of which will help alleviate pressures on housing supply. The launch of the Land Development Agency will also help to achieve greater stability in the housing market.  </p>  <p>  More broadly, we should not forget that the States Ireland competes with for FDI often have difficulties of their own. Thankfully, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting mobile investment are well known in the global marketplace. Businesses continue to be attracted here because of our talented workforce, membership of the EU and pro-enterprise policy environment. These aspects of our value proposition remain strong and continue to position Ireland as a favoured location for FDI. </p></reply>

Cycle 5 projects have now been completed and my Department is addressing the remaining payments associated with these awards. In addition to supporting the provision of top-class research infrastructure (buildings, laboratories and cutting-edge equipment), PRTLI saw significant investment in human capital development, through Structured PhD/Emergent Technology programmes across Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutes (HEIs). </p>  <p>  Innovation 2020, the Government's strategy for research and innovation, includes an action to scope out and develop a successor to PRTLI to support new investment in research infrastructure, including buildings and equipment.  It also contains an action to increase the enrolment of PhD and research masters students. The scoping of a future cycle of PRTLI has been undertaken by my Department, working with the Department of Education and Skills (DES). </p>  <p>  While future cycles of PRTLI are referenced in the National Development Plan, Project Ireland 2040, it is important to note that actions are already being taken by DBEI and DES to fund all of the key elements that had been encompassed by PRTLI including research buildings, equipment and structured PhD programmes.  These actions include:</p>  <p>  - DBEI, through Science Foundation Ireland, has allocated more than &euro;50m for research equipment across the higher education system since the start of 2016. SFI will announce shortly the results of its 2018 Research Infrastructure Call, providing significant additional investment for research equipment.</p>  <p>  - DBEI, again through Science Foundation Ireland, has commenced roll-out of a new &euro;100 million programmes of investment in PhDs and Research Masters through new Centres for Research Training (CRT). The annual budget for this programme will increase to &euro;15 million from 2019. The CRT programme will provide training for cohorts of Research Masters and PhD students with new cohorts of students enrolling each year for four years from 2019. It will provide training for 600 postgraduate students in areas of nationally and internationally identified future skills needs of digital, data and ICT. </p>  <p>  - The Department of Education and Skills also announced funding in the context of Budget 2018 and 2019 to address the need for physical space for research in the higher education sector.  This included Budget 2018 announcements of &euro;200m for public private partnerships in the Institute of Technology sector and &euro;257m for investment in the higher education sector generally, including for research. Budget 2019 then saw announcements of &euro;57 million to be invested in higher education initiatives in 2019 along with capital investment of &euro;150 million being allocated to the higher education, further education and training and research sectors. Project Ireland 2040 signals a significant commitment in capital investments in the region of &euro;2.8 billion by the Department of Education and Skills in higher education over the coming decade, this includes public private partnership investments and support for research.  </p>  <p>  The actions being taken by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills are addressing to a significant degree the requirements for increased investment in both physical infrastructure and human capital in higher education research as identified in Innovation 2020.</p></reply>

Progress is being made towards that goal. In 2017, for example, IDA Ireland secured 99 regional investments with 45% of all new jobs created outside Dublin. The last three years have also seen 30,000 new FDI jobs created outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  The availability of marketable serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in the IDA's ability to compete for mobile FDI and win new investment for regional Ireland. Not only does such a supply of properties help the Agency to secure job-rich investment but it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing many difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It is therefore an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland.</p>  <p>  I understand that IDA Ireland owns 30 properties across the country. Of these, 13 are currently occupied by IDA clients with a further 17 properties available for prospective or existing investors.</p>  <p>  Excluding Dublin, there has been a total of 252 site visits across Ireland in the first three quarters of 2018. Such site visits remain an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and the IDA always does its utmost to ensure that overseas firms consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland. This is in line with the priority that has been placed on investment outside of our main cities, with the Agency continuing to target an increase in investment of 30% to 40% in every region of the country by the end of its current strategy in 2019.</p>  <p>  It should, however, be emphasised that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the firm concerned. It is also the case that some companies will only consider investing in urban areas, for a variety of commercial reasons. Site visit activity also does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies.</p></reply>

During this period, it emerged that there were legal difficulties in selling the properties as originally  intended. In December 2016, the Chief State Solicitors Office met with the residents' legal advisers to outline the issues arising and, in order to resolve the matter, invited proposals as to how the sales could be facilitated.  I am advised that this approach did not yield any viable proposals. </p>  <p>  Having taken into consideration the advice of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, my officials have been left with no alternative but to formally withdraw from proceeding with the proposed sales. On the 1st November 2018 the Chief State Solicitor's Office wrote to the legal representatives of the occupiers advising them accordingly.  As part of this communication my Department have indicated that it is intended to regularise the current occupancies of those people who were the subject of the original sales offer.</p></reply>

The PSSA also sets out the policy on public service pension increases as adopted by Government for the duration of that agreement to end-2020, whereby some public service pensions qualify to be increased on foot of those pay increases.  </p>  <p>  Due to the 2010 public service pay cuts and the &lsquo;grace period&rsquo; protections associated with those reductions, former public servants who retired before 1 March 2012 have their pensions based on higher &lsquo;pre-cut&rsquo; salary levels.  This has led to the situation whereby those who retired since 1 March 2012, on a like-for-like basis, generally receive lower pensions than their counterparts who retired before them.  </p>  <p>  Under Section 6.2 of the PSSA, a guiding principle of current pension increase policy is the need to adopt an equitable approach whereby those who retired since 1 March 2012 first &lsquo;catch up&rsquo; with their counterparts who retired before them on higher pension rates.  The policy out to end-2020 also provides that the benefit of the PSSA pay increases will be passed on to qualifying pre-March 2012 pensioners, but only where the pensions of those who retired since March 2012 with analogous retiring rank, pensionable service etc. have moved ahead of their pre-March 2012 retirees.  </p>  <p>  In effect, for pensions payable under &lsquo;pre-2013&rsquo; public service pension schemes including the Defence Forces (i.e. pre-Single Pension Scheme), current policy means a limited resumption of the pre-FEMPI non-statutory &lsquo;pay parity&rsquo; model, under which pension rates rose in line with pay increases. </p>  <p>  As regards military pensioners who retired since 1 March 2012, I am advised that, generally speaking, the benefit of the recent pay increases including the 1% from 1 January 2018 and 1% from 1 October 2018 under the PSSA has now been passed on (with arrears) to those concerned, including any associated dependants.  A small residual number of qualifying pensioners will get the benefit with their December 2018 monthly pension.</p></reply>

Mental health supports are part of a range of medical and non-medical services provided to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are medically fit to undertake the duties assigned to them. </p>  <p>  Medical mental health services available to personnel include access to clinical psychology and psychiatry services. The Psychology service assesses, diagnoses, treats and advises on strategies to prevent mental health disorders. Psychiatry services specialise in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. </p>  <p>  There are currently two Clinical Psychologists employed by the Defence Forces. Psychiatry services were until recently provided in-house by a military psychiatrist. This position is currently vacant with interim services being provided through a combination of external public and private services; however, efforts are continuing to recruit a full-time psychiatrist to provide an in-house service. It must be stressed that there is no delay in referring patients requiring immediate psychiatric care or assessment. </p>  <p>  In addition to these clinical supports, non-medical mental health services are provided by the Defence Forces Personnel Support Service (PSS).  The Defence Forces Personnel Support Service (PSS) provides a welfare, information, psycho-social support and referral service to serving members of the Defence Forces and their families. The service is also available to civilian employees, and in a limited role to veterans.

This network of professionals is prepared to provide immediate help to service personnel and their families in a routine environment or at a time of crisis.  This assistance can range from the simple provision of information to counselling or, if required, signposting and referral to specialist help and assistance. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the assistance may include providing psychosocial support, counselling and information &amp;amp; assistance services on a variety of issues, including relationships, general finances, addiction, retirement (including pensions and gratuities), housing, taxation and PRSI and much more.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department funds a confidential counselling, referral and support service for serving members of the Defence Forces, civilian employees and Civil Defence volunteers.  The service provides confidential counselling on a wide range of personal and work related issues, including but not limited to health, relationships, addictions, financial, bereavement, stress, conflict, critical incident and trauma. In the case of relationship counselling, the spouse or partner may also attend the counselling sessions.  </p>  <p>  A Freephone confidential helpline is available on a 24/7 basis 365 days a year. The helpline is staffed by fully-trained and experienced counsellors.  The helpline provides for referral to appointment-based telephone or face-to-face counselling.  Face-to-face counselling is provided on a national basis, i.e. in locations around the country. Written (e-mail and letter) access to the service is also provided.</p></reply>

We have already taken important steps to prepare the economy for the change that Brexit will bring, including the Action Plan for Jobs 2018, our Trade and Investment Strategy and Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>The Government has taken a number of key decisions to ensure that the necessary customs controls and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks required as a result of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, are in place to address the impacts of Brexit on trade on an East-West basis. Most recently, on 27 November, I updated the Government on progress on the necessary facilities and infrastructure for such checks and controls at Dublin Port, Rosslare Port and Dublin Airport.</p><p>Dedicated measures to get Ireland Brexit ready were announced in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Budget 2019 measures included the introduction of a new longer-term loan scheme of up to &euro;300 million, the Future Growth Loan Scheme, to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business. This scheme will be jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This is in addition to announcements in previous budgets where over &euro;450 million was allocated in business supports, including Budget 2018&rsquo;s &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme for Business.</p><p>Budget 2019 also included an allocation of &euro;115 million for Brexit measures across a number of Departments. This includes a &euro;25 million allocation for essential customs requirements. There is also increased funding to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to enable them to continue to address the challenges posed by Brexit across a range of headings, including supports for our Enterprise Agencies and for our <i>&lsquo;</i>Global Ireland&rsquo; &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s Global Footprint to 2025 strategy. This strategy will support the opening of new markets for our businesses and a higher international profile. Increased funding to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has already provided for the opening of 13 new diplomatic missions as part of Global Ireland 2025, which will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets. As well as addressing the challenge of Brexit, our trade and investment strategy<i></i>Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World has at its core our ongoing commitment to the EU and access to a Single Market of 27 Member States with 450 million people post Brexit, as well as access to a further 53 markets under EU Free Trade Agreements.</p><p>The funding provided to Departments in Budget 2019 includes a &euro;78m package for farmers, fishermen, food SMEs and to cover additional costs related to Brexit. This package includes dedicated funds to support infrastructure and innovation, including: &euro;6 million in funding to progress an &euro;8m Food Innovation Hub in Teagasc Moorepark; &euro;13m in supports for food industry competitiveness and innovation; &euro;4m for the commencement of a phased process of recruitment of additional staff to carry out the greatly increased volumes of import controls and export certification arising from Brexit; and an initial provision of just over &euro;3m to address ICT hardware and software requirements.</p><p>Good long-term planning supported by investment in Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure also has an important to play is ensuring the resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s economy in the face of Brexit. The National Development Plan (NDP) 2018 &ndash; 2027 comprises an investment programme of &euro;116 billion. Investments which will be particularly relevant to Brexit include the integration of transport, energy and communications networks; new resources for tourism development and promotion; and supporting Brexit-exposed firms to diversify to international markets. </p><p>The Government and state agencies are also working hard to fully exploit any opportunities from Brexit. This includes promoting Ireland as an English speaking member of the EU with unfettered access to the EU market, and as a preferred destination for inward investment.</p></reply>

The conference aimed to provide an opportunity for coaches to network on a cross-border basis, and to engage with Irish and international coaches in talks and practical sessions to assist in the development of young players, both male and female. It aimed to promote meaningful cross-border links by encouraging both associations to work together to deliver a conference which would also provide coaches from across the island with the opportunity to network and establish relationships.</p><p>All grantees awarded funding through the Reconciliation Fund are required under the grant&rsquo;s terms of agreement to submit a post-grant narrative and financial report demonstrating how the grant was spent, as well as the organisation&rsquo;s accounts for the relevant year clearly showing the grant as a separate item of income. The grant&rsquo;s terms of agreement provide for auditing spot-checks to be undertaken by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on a number of grants made through the Reconciliation Fund in a given year. The Comptroller and Auditor General also carries out a number of spot-checks on Reconciliation Fund grant payments on an annual basis.<table><tr><th><b>Transaction Date</b></th><th><b>Description</b></th><th><b>Transaction Amount</b></th><th><b>Name</b></th></tr><tr><td>20/06/2008</td><td>T1 2008 &ndash; FAI</td><td>25,000.00</td><td>Reconciliation Fund, IUKA</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Totals</td><td>25,000.00</td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

A reduced fee is applied on applications for passports for minors in recognition of the fact that a minor&rsquo;s passport is valid for only five years. Most adult passports will be issued for a period of ten years.</p>  <p>  I have asked my staff to review the cost of the standard ten year adult Irish passport and to compare it to the cost of a similar passport in many other jurisdictions. I am satisfied that, at a cost of &euro;80, which breaks down to &euro;8 per year, the Irish passport fee compares favourably with the services offered elsewhere. For example, an adult would have to pay &euro;8.20 per year for a British passport, &euro;8.60 per year for a French passport, &euro;9.75 per year for an American passport and &euro;18.10 per year for an Australian passport.</p>  <p>  Based on 2017 application volumes, the Passport Service has calculated the potential annual cost of reducing the passport application fee to &euro;60 for applicants over 75 years of age to be just under half a million euros. Given that any shortfall in revenue would have to be met by the taxpayer, a decision to waive or reduce the application fee for any category of applicant would require careful consideration. It is important to ensure that the major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements which have taken place in recent years can be maintained and further developed. </p>  <p>  In the context of the services provided by the Passport Service, I would like to draw attention to the well-advanced Passport Reform Programme, one element of which is the Online Passport Renewal Service which was launched on 30 March 2017. To date over 298,000 adults have renewed their passport using this online facility. </p>  <p>  The Online Passport Renewal Service has recently expanded to include the online renewal of children&rsquo;s passports, to introduce a passport card for children and to expand the cohort of adults eligible to renew online. The service brings significant benefits for citizens with faster turnaround times of 10 working days for all online applications, excluding postage.  In addition, the cost of renewing a passport online is significantly cheaper than alternative methods, with fees for all online applications being reduced by &euro;5 across all application types.  The expanded service is now available to all adults and children who wish to renew their passport.</p>  <p>  Whilst the online service does not distinguish between applicants based on age, applicants can be assured that the online system will be the cheapest as well as the most efficient, secure and convenient way to apply to renew their passport.</p></reply>

Section 6A of the 1956 Act, provides that person born in the State on or after 1 January 2005 where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction, may claim citizenship by birth in the State where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for 3 years of the 4 years preceding their birth.</p><p>Furthermore, if a person was born abroad to an Irish born parent he or she is automatically and Irish citizen.  If born abroad to a parent also born abroad, but whose grandparent was born in Ireland, the person can claim Irish citizenship by registering their birth on the Department&rsquo;s Foreign Birth register - see <i>www.dfa.ie </i>for further details.</p><p>If a person cannot claim Irish citizenship through birth or descent, they may be able to claim citizenship through naturalisation, subject to certain residency requirements.  This is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality and further information may be obtained on<i>www.inis.gov.ie.</i></p><p>Information on all passport related matters, including the documents required to support a claim to Irish citizenship is available on the Passport Service website at <i>www.dfa.ie/passport</i>.</p></reply>

The Compact represents common ground for cooperation between countries and regions which have very different perspectives on, and experiences, of migration.</p>  <p>  Ireland was proud to co-facilitate, with Jordan, the New York Declaration in 2016 that led to the Global Compacts on both Migration and Refugees; we have played our part in achieving this multilateral effort to address an issue of common concern.  </p>  <p>  This is against a background where individual States cannot address challenges relating to migration alone. For example, cross-border efforts are essential if human smuggling and trafficking is to be reduced. Ireland is also supportive of efforts to address the root causes of forced displacement and irregular migration, including through our participation in the EU Trust Fund for Africa.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality take the lead role on the implementation of the Global Compact for Migration, and my Department is also engaged on the preparations for the UN Intergovernmental Conference in Marrakech. Ireland will be represented by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Charles Flanagan T.D.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Global Compact will be adopted at the Conference by consensus (or a vote may be called, with a two thirds majority required) after which the Document will be presented to the UN General Assembly for final and formal adoption, probably later in December or in January 2019.</p></reply>

The conflict was sparked, more than seven years ago, by brutal repression of dissent by the Assad regime. The conduct of the conflict, including the use of chemical weapons and medieval &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; tactics, is estimated to have cost the lives of over 400,000 people. It has led to a situation in which 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.</p><p>Sanctions are a tool which the international community may use to put political pressure on those who commit violence against their own people. Targeted EU sanctions are in place against people and entities that are complicit in the violent repression of the civilian population in Syria. The first person on this EU list is Bashar Al Assad, whose brutal pursuit of this conflict, neglecting all opportunities to seek a political solution, has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. There are numerous barriers to humanitarian access in Syria as a result of actions by the parties to the conflict, particularly the Assad regime.</p><p>Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the Assad regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation in Syria justifies these measures.  <b></b></p><p>The EU&rsquo;s Basic Principles on the Use of Restrictive Measures state that &ldquo;Sanctions should be targeted in a way that has maximum impact on those whose behaviour we want to influence. Targeting should reduce to the maximum extent possible any adverse humanitarian effects or unintended consequences for persons not targeted &hellip;.&rdquo; Accordingly, the EU&rsquo;s Syria sanctions include specific exemptions for essential civilian needs and for humanitarian assistance. Ireland has been a consistent advocate for ensuring such exemptions are included. </p><p>In line with the EU strategy on Syria, the EU is maintaining its restrictive measures against the Syrian regime and its supporters as long as the repression of civilians continues. To repeal these sanctions could be misconstrued as tacit acquiescence in the actions of the Assad regime and therefore serve to encourage a belief in impunity with regard to attacks on civilians, and disregard for the UN-led peace process. </p><p>The EU does however keep the impact of sanctions under constant review, and will consider options to mitigate any unintended consequences which can be documented as relating directly to the measures themselves, as distinct from the more general economic disruption caused by the conflict. The relevant working groups in Brussels propose options to address any unintended negative impacts where they are identified. Those who are working to deliver aid in the complex environment inside Syria constantly assess the impact of various factors, including sanctions, on their ability to deliver aid, and where relevant issues arise, officials from my Department raise these matters in discussions at EU level.</p><p>For example, in 2016 the EU amended the Syria sanctions regime to make it easier for NGOs operating in Syria to buy fuel. In 2017, EU Member States including Ireland consulted with NGOs to identify any further difficulties they were experiencing in carrying out humanitarian work in Syria that may have been linked to the sanctions. Based on the feedback of the NGOs, the European Commission published a Frequently Asked Questions document to clarify certain provisions of the sanctions identified as unclear by NGOs, as well as the humanitarian exemptions and derogations. In April of this year, EU Member States reviewed best practice guidelines on humanitarian exemptions, with a view to facilitating the work of NGOs responding to humanitarian crises, including the crisis in Syria. I welcome the ongoing work to implement the findings of previous reviews. </p></reply>

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.</p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most. More than 400,000 people have died and an estimated 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan. On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalisation Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place last week.</p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peace building. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as Head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.</p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.</p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than &euro;90 million so far this year.</p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.</p></reply>

A free, fair, and open civil society space is essential for a democratic society that functions for all. </p>  <p>  Guatemala has made some advances in its political and social development over the past two decades, since the gradual cessation of armed conflict from 1996 onwards.  While overcoming the legacy of human rights crimes committed during the country&rsquo;s three decades of civil war remains a challenge, it is an essential element of Guatemala&rsquo;s development as a democratic society.  I urge the Government of Guatemala to address historical impunity at all levels, and to fully investigate the incidents to which the Deputy refers and to bring the perpetrators to justice. </p>  <p>  Ireland engaged in the Review of Guatemala during the 28th Session of the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council in Geneva in November 2017.  We took this opportunity to voice concerns over the levels of violence, intimidation, harassment, and criminalisation faced by human rights defenders in Guatemala.  Ireland called on the Government of Guatemala to take all necessary measures to protect human rights defenders and to allow them to carry out their important work in safety. </p>  <p>  Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade also meet regularly with human rights defenders and civil society organisations active in Latin America, including in Guatemala, who provide valuable insight into the situation on the ground. </p>  <p>  While Ireland does not have a resident Embassy in Guatemala City, in keeping with our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and working with partners on the ground, we will continue to follow the situation in Guatemala closely, and to raise our concerns regarding threats against human rights defenders in discussions on Guatemala at EU and international level. </p></reply>

The relentless processes by which Palestinians are pressured from their homes and off the land, in order to make way for Israeli settlers, are a daily reminder of the urgency of bringing this occupation to an end. These processes include the impossibility of obtaining planning permission for permanent structures, demolitions, denial of fair access to water for farming and livestock, and a legal regime which leaves many ordinary civilians governed by Israeli military law, rather than being governed by laws and judges who represent the community being governed.</p>  <p>  We have on many occasions discussed specific cases here in the Oireachtas. These policies are in evidence across the Occupied Territories: in East Jerusalem, in communities such as Khan al Ahmar, across the West Bank, and on the Golan Heights. They constitute institutionalised injustice against the people under occupation. I made a statement specifically on the situation in Khan al Ahmar in May of this year, noting that this vulnerable Bedouin community, who have already been expelled once by Israel from their former homes in the Negev area, are again threatened unjustly with forced removal, and calling on the Israeli authorities to halt the demolitions of Palestinian property and the removal of Palestinian communities.    </p>  <p>  As I have reported on many occasions, these concerns form a constant element in our dialogue with the Israeli authorities, whether at Ministerial level, or at diplomatic and official level. I stated the Government&rsquo;s views on settlements directly with Israeli authorities during my visits to Israel and Palestine in July 2017 and January and June 2018.</p>  <p>  Ireland also pursues this issue in UN fora. At Israel&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council in January, Ireland raised the continued expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, and urged that Israel abide by its international legal obligations, including under the Fourth Geneva Convention, on the treatment of a civilian population under military occupation. </p>  <p>  The issue of settlements also forms a major element in the concerns expressed by the European Union about Israeli policies, and Ireland inputs strongly into EU discussions on these matters. I and my EU colleagues have particularly highlighted our concerns about the village of Khan al Ahmar on a number of occasions.  </p>  <p>  The continuation of the settlement project is a major obstacle to peace negotiations, and undermines the credibility of Israel&rsquo;s commitment to a peaceful solution to the conflict. </p></reply>

Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption. There is no specific exemption from the requirement to pay LPT for pensioners or older persons under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), though such persons may be entitled to an exemption on other grounds or may qualify for a deferral subject to meeting the qualifying conditions. </p>  <p>  The Inter-departmental Group considered the provision of deferrals for households unable to pay the tax or where a payment requirement would cause hardship. Part 12 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) accordingly provides for  a system of deferral arrangements for owner-occupiers where there is an inability to pay the tax and the person meets certain criteria based on income thresholds.  These deferral arrangements also take account of mortgage interest payments made by the property owner. </p>  <p>  The property must be the sole or main residence of the liable person and his or her gross income must be below certain thresholds.  The thresholds are &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a married couple, civil partners or cohabiting couple.  Deferral in respect of half of the local property tax payable is possible, where the gross income is above the threshold but less than &euro;25,000 in the case of a single person and &euro;35,000 in the case of a couple.</p>  <p>  Where a liable person does not qualify for, or does not wish to avail of, a deferral, phased payment of LPT can be used to assist with budgeting. The Government is aware of the difficulties facing many individuals and families, and for this reason a wide variety of methods for payment of the LPT are available from which liable persons can choose the method most suited to their individual circumstances. </p>  <p>  A review of the LPT is currently being finalised that is looking in particular at the impact on LPT liabilities of property price developments. It includes an examination of the outstanding recommendations of the 2015 Thornhill review of the Local Property Tax. The review is informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons.</p></reply>

I have no role in day to day supervision of the insurance industry, as this is the responsibility of the Central Bank of Ireland.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has two specific mandates as regards insurance supervision.  Firstly, it is responsible for the prudential supervision of insurance companies it has authorised by seeking to ensure that such firms remain solvent.  Secondly, the Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the supervision of conduct of business by insurance companies operating in Ireland, also referred to as consumer protection.  All regulated entities must comply with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (&ldquo;the Code&rdquo;).  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that Chapter 11 of the Code contains a number of record keeping requirements for regulated entities which includes insurance undertakings and insurance intermediaries.  It states that in particular, Provision 11.6 of this chapter requires regulated entities to retain records of individual transactions for six years after the date on which the particular transaction is discontinued or completed, and that a regulated entity must retain all other records for six years from the date on which the regulated entity ceased to provide any product or service to the consumer concerned.</p></reply>

It will provide a source of funding for small to medium sized residential developments on a commercial basis. The Home Building Finance Ireland Act passed remaining stages in the Oireachtas two weeks ago and was enacted in the past few days. Much progress has been made in preparing HBFI for launch and it is expected that HBFI will commence receiving funding applications towards the end of January 2019. HBFI will be in a position to consider applications from apartment owners and management companies for such funding at that time.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that in order for HBFI&rsquo;s activities to comply with State aid rules it must operate on a commercial basis. This means, for example, that HBFI will not be in a position to offer cheap or subsidised credit. Any funding provided by HBFI will be backed by appropriate security and normal banking terms and conditions will apply.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the funding of remediation works are complex and high risk projects and pose significant issues for lenders in relation to access to appropriate security etc. While HBFI will be open to considering all residential development construction related activity, it is the responsibility of all applicants to ensure that their applications for funding are commercially viable and allow HBFI to remain compliant with State aid rules.</p></reply>

This period was subsequently extended but during last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill a commitment was given to undertake a review of the 9% VAT rate.  This review was published in July 2018 and the Budget decision to increase the VAT rate was made following that analysis, which indicated that the majority of activity at the 9% VAT rate is driven by income growth more than price and that the retention of the rate provides little additional benefit relative to its cost.</p>  <p>  The Review of the 9% VAT rate found that tourism expenditure is more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than to price changes.  The economy is currently performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector.  Growth is also expected to continue in the medium term. This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that economic activity within the sectors to which the 9% VAT rate applies remains strong.  </p>  <p>  In this context, it is believed that the VAT rating applied to the tourism sector should not greatly impact demand, or employment, in the sector.</p></reply>

As it was a Maltese incorporated company, the liquidation is being carried out under Maltese law.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018 (Act 21 of 2018) was signed into law in July this year. Section 12 of the Act provides that the State Claims Agency may, from time to time but not more frequently than once in every three month period, apply to the High Court for approval for payments from the Insurance Compensation Fund in respect of claimants of an insolvent insurer authorised in another EU Member State.  Setanta Insurance falls under this section of the Act.</p><p>The State Claims Agency on 19 November, obtained High Court approval for payments from the Fund in respect of the fourth tranche of payments to Setanta claimants.  This tranche of claims is comprised of approximately 1,500 separate payments with a value of approximately &euro;21 million, and will comprise of (a) newly settled claims requiring 100% payment, (b) all those cases where 65% was previously paid and where the balance of 35% is due and (c) a number of third party legal costs payments. </p><p>It should be noted that the process of settling claims is still ongoing and is subject in some cases to court procedures.  However the liqudator estimates that the process of settling the vast majority of these outstanding claims should be completed by end-2019.</p><p>Finally as the next application to the High Court is  subject to the three-month rule, it is hoped that court approval for the next batch of payments can be made at the end of February.  However, as this a matter between the liquidator and the State Claims Agency, I am not in a position to give an absolute commitment on this at this stage. </p><p>I should however have a better insight into the timing details closer to the end of this three month period.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions: </p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms; </p><p>- be without one or both legs; </p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure.

It is, of course, a criminal offence for an unauthorised firm/person to provide financial services in Ireland that would require an authorisation under the relevant legislation which the Central Bank is the responsible body for enforcing. </p><p>The Central Bank has no power or regulatory role in respect of illegal moneylenders.  Illegal moneylenders fall within the remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Central Bank is statutorily required to report any suspicions of illegal moneylending to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and does so when it becomes aware of suspected cases of illegal moneylending.  Members of the public and licensed moneylenders are encouraged to report any suspicions of illegal moneylending to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>As at 31 December 2014 there were 38 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. </p><p>As at 31 December 2015 there were 39 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. </p><p>As at 31 December 2016 there were 39 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. </p><p>As at 31 December 2017 there were 40 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank. </p><p>As at 29 November 2018 there are 39 moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank.</p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s public register of moneylenders sets out the District Court districts in which each licensed moneylender is permitted to operate.  Currently, 28 moneylenders are permitted to operate in all districts. S.I. 172/2013 (available on <i>www.irishstatutebook.ie</i>), sets out the up to date list of District Court districts and their related areas.</p><p>Each moneylender&rsquo;s licence (which can be found on the Central Bank&rsquo;s Register of Moneylenders, available at the following link: <i>) </i>includes details of the duration, maximum APR, maximum cost of credit and the collection charge (if any) of the loans which can be offered by a licensed moneylender.  Licensed moneylenders are prohibited from applying additional charges (other than a collection charge) to a moneylending agreement and are also prohibited from applying any additional charges in the event of a default in the payments due under the agreement (i.e., the total amount repayable by a consumer is limited to the amount specified in the moneylending agreement). </p><p>The Consumer Credit Act 1995, the legislation under which moneylenders are licensed, does not provide for an APR/interest rate cap.  Nor does the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010.  Therefore, the Central Bank has no statutory power to impose a market wide cap on rates.  Any legislative proposals in this regard would have to be careful to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit and ensure that it did not have unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion.</p><p>The legislation provides that the Central Bank can refuse to grant a licence to a moneylender if it is of the opinion that the cost of credit to be charged is excessive.  Since the Central Bank assumed responsibility for the licensed moneylending sector in 2003, it has not permitted an increase to the maximum APR charged in the sector.  During the Central Bank&rsquo;s engagements with new or potential applicants, it examines, on a case-by-case basis, if the proposed costs of credit are excessive and it has successfully challenged firms in this regard.  Nor has the Bank licensed any moneylender to provide the &lsquo;pay-day loan&rsquo; services that exist in other jurisdictions such as the UK and the Bank will continue to pursue this policy.</p><p>The Central Bank has stated its view publicly that the introduction of an interest rate ceiling may not achieve the objective of lowering the total cost of credit, for example if the licensed moneylender chose instead to extend the duration of the loan.  Any legislative proposals in this regard would therefore have to be careful to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit.  Lower interest rate ceilings could be ineffective and counterproductive in this regard and may result in excluding low income households that have repayment capacity from accessing such credit, even at the high rates charged by licensed moneylenders.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-04a.330.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400072#WRF05200"><p>Section 38 1(a) of the Credit Union Act 1997 prescribes that the interest on a Credit Union loan shall not at any time exceed 1% per month.  I can confirm that the power to increase this cap has not been vested in the Central Bank and therefore whether the 1% per month interest limit for the credit union sector should be increased is a matter for the Minister for Finance, Government and the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware the interest rate ceiling on Credit Union loans has been subject to recent discussion in a number of fora.</p>  <p>  Firstly, the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) - the statutory committee whose function is to advise the Minister for Finance in relation to matters relating to credit unions - published a policy paper on this issue in December 2017 following a survey of credit unions.  In its policy paper on the loan interest rate cap the CUAC recommended that credit unions should be permitted to charge an interest rate on loans greater than the present ceiling of 1% per month, and proposed that the cap be raised to 2% per month.  This change would provide credit unions with greater flexibility to risk price loan products and in so doing may create an opportunity for new product offerings. It is important to note that CUAC's recommendation to increase the loan interest rate ceiling would not mean that credit unions are required to raise their loan interest rates, rather they could apply their own interest rates within the parameters allowed.  The policy paper is available on my Department's website.  </p>  <p>  Secondly, the CUAC Report Implementation Group - a group established to oversee and monitor the implementation of recommendations from the CUAC report - has also considered the issue of the increasing the interest rate cap as recommended in the CUAC policy paper.  This group is chaired by my Department and is made up of one member from each of the credit union representative bodies - the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers&rsquo; Association and the National Supervisors Forum - and a member from the Central Bank.  The Implementation Group is currently in the process of finalising its Final Report which will be published shortly.  Following publication of the Final Report, I will review the Implementation Group's recommendation on the loan interest cap, along with the CUAC recommendation already received, and consider if any legislative changes are required.   </p>  <p>  Finally, I should also note that the CUAC recommendation on the interest rate cap is aligned with a similar recommendation that has been put forward recently in the "Interest Rate Restrictions on Credit for Low-income Borrowers" report, compiled by the Centre for Co-operative Studies University College Cork on behalf of the Social Finance Foundation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-04a.333.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400072#WRF05500"><p>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the SBCI.  The SBCI is Ireland&rsquo;s national promotional institution for SMEs.  The SBCI does not provide financing directly to SMEs, rather, it uses an on-lending model and works with both banks and non-bank finance providers to make lower-cost finance available to eligible enterprises. The SBCI currently has 3 bank and 3 non-bank on-lenders. </p>  <p>  The strategic mission of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs.  The SBCI achieves this through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk-sharing activities, which involve the provision of guarantees.  To date, none of the SBCI&rsquo;s funding has been used to support a specific credit insurance product; rather, as I mentioned, it provides guarantees to and engages in the sharing of risk with its partner finance providers, as well as the State and European partners. </p>  <p>  In respect of the figures sought by the Deputy, I am advised that the SBCI does not obtain details of the number of applications for loans made to its on-lending partners and does not receive loan applications directly from SMEs, due to its on-lending model. Instead, the SBCI only obtains information from its on-lending partners in respect of the number of loans to SMEs that have been sanctioned. </p>  <p>  At the end of March 2018, the total volume of SBCI supported lending activity through eight on-lending partners, including loans made under the SBCI&rsquo;s risk-sharing guarantee schemes, was &euro;972 million to over 24,000 SMEs supporting 129,300. </p>  <p>  The Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme and the Brexit Loan Scheme are the SBCI&rsquo;s two major risk-sharing guarantee Schemes. </p>  <p>  Under the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme, which has now concluded, a total of approximately &euro;145 million of loans were drawn down by over 4,200 SMES.  These loans were made available through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. SMEs applied directly to those banks for loan approval and these applications were subject to the banks&rsquo; normal credit assessment processes.</p>  <p>  Up to &euro;300 million of funding to SMEs and small MidCaps is currently available under the Brexit Loan Scheme.  There is a two-stage application process for this funding.  First, businesses must apply to the SBCI to confirm their eligibility for the Scheme.  As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges.  The SBCI has advised me that it deals with these eligibility applications within 24 hours.  Then, loans are subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures. The Scheme is available through the AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. </p>  <p>  Since the launch of the Brexit Loan Scheme on 28 March 2018 to 23 November 2018, the SBCI has received 307 applications.  Of these, 270 have been deemed eligible to proceed to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the Scheme.  In total, 54 SMEs have progressed to sanction at partner finance provider level to a total value of &euro;12,510,000.</p>  <p>  The SBCI also operates the Credit Guarantee Scheme on behalf of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. In the last two years, loans of &euro;28.7 million have been supported under the Scheme providing funding to 190 SMEs. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises&rdquo; applies to applications made to the SBCI&rsquo;s on-lenders that are regulated entities by the Central Bank of Ireland.  This Code requires the finance providers to set out their timelines for dealing with loan applications, which vary depending on the size of the loan.</p></reply>

The total value of the Prize Bonds fund at the end of 2017 was &euro;3.17 billion.</p><p>I am also informed by the NTMA that it has no immediate plans to change the variable percentage rate used to calculate the prize fund.

I have received it and would make a few points on same. </p>  <p>  I note the Council's endorsement of my Department&rsquo;s economic forecasts for 2018 and 2019 that underpin the Budgetary arithmetic. I would also draw attention to the fact that, last month, the European Commission assessed Budget 2019 as being compliant with the fiscal rules, a welcome endorsement. I also note the Council's assessment of the risks facing our economy, including possible overheating, residential building activity, the reliance on highly concentrated foreign-owned activities and, last but by no means least, the potential impacts that Brexit may have. My Department has also identified these risks in the Budget documentation (Economic &amp;amp; Fiscal Outlook, pp. 43-44) and I share both of these assessments.</p>  <p>  The best way to mitigate these risks is to carefully manage the public finances and to ensure our economy remains competitive. That is what the Government has done in the Budget through the elimination of the headline deficit, reduction of the general government debt ratio and the establishment of the Rainy Day Fund. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Council&rsquo;s assertion that Ireland&rsquo;s debt burden remains high. My Department publishes an Annual Debt Report to highlight this issue and I want to reiterate that reducing public debt is a key priority for the Government. It is oft-stated Government policy that windfall receipts from any future sale of state assets will be used to reduce the debt burden.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that I am in the process of drafting my formal response to the FAR which will be published in due course.</p></reply>

In essence, the change introduced by Finance Act 2014 was designed to ensure that a company could no longer use an Irish label of incorporation without also being tax resident here.</p>  <p>  As my predecessor has clearly stated in the past, the &lsquo;double Irish&rsquo; was not part of the Irish tax offering. It was just one example of the many international tax-planning arrangements which have been designed and developed by tax and legal advisers to take advantage of mismatches between the tax rules in two or more countries. In many cases these were designed to exploit gaps in US anti-avoidance rules.  Therefore, action was taken by Ireland in Finance Act 2014 to amend our residency rules in the absence of US tax reform.  The recent US tax reform sees that country asserting its global taxing rights and this should put an end to the type of arrangements some multinationals were previously able to use to avoid tax. </p>  <p>  We are already seeing evidence of US companies recognising a tax charge and paying tax in the US in respect of historic profits as a result of US tax reform. I believe the changes introduced, combined with the widespread implementation of the BEPS recommendations, will have a major impact on the ability of multinationals to engage in aggressive tax planning. </p>  <p>  The amendment in Finance Act 2014 was brought into effect for new companies incorporated after 1 January 2015.  To ensure that this change did not negatively impact on other related group companies who have real and substantial operations in Ireland, a transition period until end 2020 was provided to give these groups a reasonable timeframe to plan and re-organise their business structures to take account of this change. </p>  <p>  I am informed by Revenue that, as the so-called &lsquo;double Irish&rsquo; structure is not part of the Irish tax code, Revenue does not have a register of companies incorporated but not tax-resident in Ireland that may be used in that structure. Statistics regarding such companies, which may include companies used in a &lsquo;double Irish&rsquo; structure, are therefore not available. However I would again note that there is evidence that multi-lateral and US tax reform is proving successful in ensuring that profits in such companies are subject to tax.</p></reply>

They provide additional benefits over and above normal pension entitlements, to or in respect of officers who are killed or injured in the performance of their duties. </p><p>An annual allowance may be granted to an officer who is forced to retire as a result of their injuries, or in respect of an officer who dies within 7 years and as a result of their injuries. Special gratuities may be granted in cases of death or injury in the course of duty while travelling by air, or as a direct result of war, insurrection or civil unrest.</p><p>To qualify for the award of an annual allowance under the Injury Warrants, all of the following conditions must be met: </p><p>1. the injury must result in retirement on grounds of ill-health (if the individual dies within seven years of the date of injury, their dependants may qualify for an annual allowance);</p><p>2. the injury must occur in the actual discharge of duties;</p><p>3. the injury must be specifically attributable to the nature of the officer's duties; and</p><p>4. the injury must not result from the officer's own default.</p><p>Allowance payments are at varying rates, depending on the degree to which the officer&rsquo;s capacity to contribute to his/her own support is impaired as a result of the injury.</p><p>No new awards have been granted under the Civil Service Injury Warrants over the past five years. Three applications have been refused, with the reasons cited linked to the conditions mentioned above. In one case, the application was refused on grounds that a previous compensation settlement had been paid that prevented the application from being proceeded with. </p><p>Finally, I would point out that I have personal responsibility in relation to the Civil Service Pension Scheme. I understand that sectoral provisions, similar in purpose to the Injury Warrants, exist for other parts of the public service, and so the Deputy may also wish to direct his query to the Ministers concerned.</p></reply>

Funding for the repair of damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure was made available to the Local Authorities via the Office of Public Works (OPW), based on programmes of works submitted by the local authorities.</p>  <p>  Total funding of &euro;126,792 was allocated by the OPW to Meath County Council for the repair of damaged coastal protection infrastructure.  The Council has confirmed that the works at Laytown, including the replacement of sea defence systems  (gabions / rock armour revetment) were carried out using this funding.  This was a once-off allocation, and no further funding is available under this stream.  The OPW was therefore not in a position to approve an application for further funding in this regard received earlier this year from Meath County Council.</p>  <p>  As the works at Laytown were carried out by Meath County Council, details on the full cost of those works should be sought directly from the Local Authority.</p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>   This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

I have spoken publicly of how vital it is that our young people can learn from the past so that they can plan for the future. I think it is very important that our education system should provide the opportunity to learn about, and learn from, key times and events in our history, events that we particularly recall in this decade of centenaries. These include the end of the First World War, the delicate path we walk to mark the foundation of the State, and the role of women in society.  The study of our history can also afford the opportunity to consider and learn from the story of Irish migration, of the journey from conflict to peace on this island, and to learn about the rich history of our Irish language and its place in our culture and our heritage.</p>  <p>  Prior to the implementation of the new Framework for Junior Cycle, only 52% of schools - the voluntary secondary schools - provided History as a core subject.  Yet 90% of students present for History in the Junior Certificate examination each year. </p>  <p>  It is against this backdrop, of the importance of learning from our past, that I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to review the optional nature of history under the new Framework for Junior Cycle. History was one of the new subject specifications introduced to schools just last September.</p>  <p>  As part of their review I have also asked the NCCA to identify how we can best promote the study of history in our schools. </p>  <p>  I met with officials of the NCCA and had an initial discussion on this matter. I expect to receive a report from the Council by the end of the first quarter of next year. </p></reply>

This position has not changed as a result of the Croke Park Agreement.</p><p>However, all schools are encouraged to use some form of educational planning for the delivery of additional teaching, or care supports, for children with special educational needs, in order to ensure that the resources are being targeted and utilised efficiently and that they are having the desired outcomes. </p><p>My Department's Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of education planning for children with special educational needs. In line with Circular 30/2014, schools are also required to put in place Personal Pupil Plan including a care plan for all pupils availing of SNA support.</p><p>Circulars 0013 and 0014 2017, which introduced a new model for allocation special education teachers to schools, noted the importance of educational planning. </p><p>The Circulars note that educational planning is an essential element of a whole-school approach to meeting pupils&rsquo; needs. Educational plans should be differentiated in line with a pupils&rsquo; needs. </p><p>A pupil&rsquo;s support plan should include clear, measurable learning targets, and specify the resources and interventions that will be used to address student needs in line with the Continuum of Support process. Individualised support plans for pupils should be developed through a collaborative process involving relevant teachers, parents/guardians, the pupils themselves and outside professionals, as necessary. The individualised planning process should include regular reviews of learning targets as part of an ongoing cycle of assessment, target setting, intervention and review.</p><p>Guidelines for schools on educational planning and monitoring of outcomes and the manner in which they should conduct educational planning, through the Student Support File, are contained in the Guidelines for Schools: Supporting Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools, available at<i>.</i></p><p><i></i>The NCSE is also available to provide support and training around education planning for pupils with special educational needs.

DEIS provides additional supports, through the DEIS School Support Programme, to schools identified as having the highest concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged communities.  Schools can use these additional resources to meet the identified needs of their pupil cohort.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware DEIS Plan 2017 was the culmination of more than 18 months of consultation and discourse with education partners and other stakeholders to ensure that identification of schools and future delivery of interventions is fully informed by the practical experience of teachers, parents, students and non-governmental organisations working on behalf of children at risk of educational disadvantage and their families</p><p>My Department has introduced an objective, statistics based model for assessing which schools merit inclusion in the DEIS Programme, so that all stakeholders can have confidence that we are targeting extra resources at those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage. </p><p>The key data sources used in the DEIS identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include not only single parent rate, but those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.  </p><p>The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school is based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined.  It is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides. </p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at<i></i></p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this will be facilitated by the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses. Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.

Supports for childcare, including pre-school education, are provided by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA). </p><p>The principal vehicle for the delivery of pre-school education is the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme which provides early childhood care and education for children of pre-school age.  </p><p>The upper age limit of 5 years and 6 months for completing the ECCE programme was set in consultation with the Early Years Education Policy Unit in DCYA and is consistent with the policy of my Department. </p><p>Current DCYA policy requires that any request for an overage exemption from ECCE eligibility criteria must be supported by a letter from a HSE/Medical Specialist (not a GP/Public Health Nurse) specifically recommending an extra year of pre-school for the child. This requirement relates to a need to maintain a clear and standard basis for applying for exemptions. </p><p>Overage exemption applications are also considered with regard to the original purpose of ECCE which is to provide a pre-school programme in the two years before a child starts school. </p><p>A part of the criteria for assessing any application for an exemption to the upper age limit is whether a child has already availed of the full ECCE provision. The current entitlement is to a maximum of two years of ECCE. Every application is considered on its own merits having regard to the individual circumstances pertaining and the legislative requirements around school starting age. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s policy is that all children must be enrolled in the primary school system, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools in the September prior to their sixth birthday. If children are not in school by six years of age, under the Education Welfare Act 2000, the Educational Welfare service must be satisfied that the child is receiving a minimum standard of education in a place other than a recognised school. </p><p>Where parents need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement, including a special class placement, they should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child. Contact details are available at .</p><p>Where there is no placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, my Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive up to 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available. </p></reply>

Within the schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary or caretaker, such staff are employees of individual schools.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently made significant efforts to improve the pay of School Secretaries and Caretakers who are employed using capitation grant assistance. In 2015 my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries on negotiations and agreed to enter an independent arbitration process on the issue. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries and caretakers comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p>  <p>  I am personally very much aware of this as an issue and the important role that School Secretaries and Caretakers play in the running of schools.  </p></reply>

Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include not only single parent rate, but those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.  </p><p>The calculation of the level of disadvantage in each school is based on the socio-economic background of their pupil cohort using centrally held data as previously outlined.  It is not based on the location of the school but on the geographical CSO Small Areas where the pupil cohort resides.</p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at<i></i></p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this will be facilitated by the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses. Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  </p><p>Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of the address data and conduct further analysis, it is not the intention of my Department to extend the DEIS Programme to any further schools until this work is complete.</p></reply>

The placement decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment. </p><p>Special school placements are provided for other students with ASD and very complex special needs who wouldn&rsquo;t manage in a mainstream school even for part of the week.</p><p>The NCSE is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers (SENOs), for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements.</p><p>Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision, including special class provision, is required, it is planned and established to meet that need. This process is ongoing.</p><p>While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand nationally. From time to time, the Council identifies local areas where additional provision is required. In those circumstances, SENOs work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved. </p><p>My Department is aware that the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 when commenced will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. </p><p>Section 8 of the Act, which commenced Monday 3rd December 2018, will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

Consequently, the number of apprentices being registered is determined by employers within each sector. My Department is committed to supporting the increased registration of apprentices and the expansion of the apprenticeship model into new sectors of the economy. The 2019 budget allocation for apprenticeship training is &euro;142m which represents an increase of over 16% on the 2018 allocation of &euro;122m.  </p><p>Arising from two calls for apprenticeship proposals issued by the Apprenticeship Council in 2015 and 2017, 17 new apprenticeships have now been developed in a range of new occupations, including financial services, engineering, ICT, hospitality, logistics and accounting.  Further new apprenticeships will get underway throughout 2019 in a variety of sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture.  These new programmes, once developed, will add to and complement the range of apprenticeships currently on offer in developing the skill needs of our economy.</p><p>This Government is also working to address the visibility of apprenticeship and has put significant additional resources into this area.  A national promotional campaign, Generation Apprenticeship, has been underway since May 2017, led by the Apprenticeship Council and SOLAS.  The campaign promotes apprenticeship on TV and radio along with social media platforms that include Twitter; LinkedIn; Facebook and Instagram.  It has been designed to influence parents, teachers and potential apprentices on the career paths and further educational opportunities arising from apprenticeship programmes. </p><p>As set out in the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, SOLAS has completed a review on pathways to participation in apprenticeship.  The purpose of the review is to ensure that our national apprenticeship system is more reflective of the range and diversity of our population, more inclusive of diverse backgrounds and abilities and that apprenticeship opportunities are more readily accessible to all. Work is already underway in many of the areas identified for action and SOLAS will lead implementation of the actions, working closely with apprenticeship partners and stakeholders, in particular employers, education and training providers and apprentices themselves.  The review is available on SOLAS&rsquo;s website <i>www.solas.ie</i>.</p><p>Work is also underway in SOLAS on a new employer portal initiative which will provide capability to approved employers to advertise apprenticeships, as well as other value-added services. The new portal is expected to be rolled out in 2019 on successful completion of a pilot phase.</p><p>In addition, an independent review of career guidance which is being carried out by Indecon International Consultants will examine the quality and range of information and resources available to students in schools and other settings.  This will include an examination of how apprenticeship opportunities are presented to students in our schools. </p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2011 was &euro;27,814. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;36,318 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On Monday 24th September, the Government welcomed the outcome of discussions between public service employers and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. </p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants at points 4 and 8 of their scale. </p>  <p>  These restorations for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. The Public Service Stability Agreement provides a range of protections and benefits to public servants who are covered by the agreement. If a union opts to withdraw from the agreement, they are choosing to forego these protections and benefits.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, school leadership is again supported with an additional release day for teaching principals in primary schools and a further four additional release days for teaching principals in schools with special classes. These additional release days - 18, 24, and 30 depending on the size of the school - will be effective from 1st September 2019.  </p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets, including &euro;0.4 million made available in Budget 2018 to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This funding provided an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  The Department also introduced an extension to the arrangements for schools with teaching principals to cluster their release days into full-time posts, with one teacher covering the release days of all the schools in the cluster.  Up to 50 principal release cluster posts will be put in place for the current school year. This measure will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.</p>  <p>  On 26 November, 2018 the Minister for Education and Skills, Joe McHugh T.D., announced that the Minor Works Grant of &euro;29m will be paid to all primary schools throughout the country over the next number of days.  This follows a commitment under Project Ireland 2040 that the Minor Works Grant will be paid on an annual basis to all primary schools.  </p>  <p>  All primary schools receive a flat rate Minor Works Grant of &euro;5,500 plus &euro;18.50 per mainstream pupil and &euro;74 per special needs pupil attending a special school or special class. The grant is worth &euro;6,425 for a 50 pupil school and over &euro;11,000 for a 300 pupil school. </p>  <p>  While schools have discretion under the Minor Works Grant Scheme in relation to the nature of small scale works and improvements to be carried out to their school buildings, the Department advised all school authorities to use the grant in the first instance to prioritise fire safety prevention works.   </p>  <p>  While Budget 2012 increased the appointment and retention ratios for small schools (i.e., schools with up to four classroom teachers), the staffing ratios of these schools have been improved since 2015.</p>  <p>  In September 2015, improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher were introduced, along with the improved appointment and retention thresholds for one-teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 announced a 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule with this improvement implemented in the 2016/17 school year. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 announced two adjustments in relation to one teacher schools. Where the school is the sole primary school on an island the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.  In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.  </p>  <p>  Improvements to the staffing schedule announced in Budget 2018 brings the teacher allocation ratio in all primary schools to the most favourable level ever seen at primary level and these improvements were introduced in the current school year.</p>  <p>  The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including small schools that were affected by the Budget 2012 changes, to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that some primary schools are experiencing difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers. </p>  <p>  I recently published the teacher supply action plan, which contains actions under a number of headings: data collection and analysis; promotion of the teaching profession; initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher supply. One of the actions is to review the potential for substitute teacher supply panels for primary schools and my Department has held initial discussions with the INTO on this matter.</p></reply>

Consequently, the likely completion date for the project is now April 2019.  </p>  <p>  I know how disappointing this is for the school and I understand how difficult it is for it to manage out a growing enrolment until its new building is in place.

The objective always is to deal with these as efficiently as possible to minimise delay.    </p>  <p>  The project is being delivered by the local County Council which is continuing to pursue the contractor for as speedy a delivery of the project as possible.  The Council has the full support of my Department in its efforts to achieve this without compromising the integrity of the building being delivered.  </p>  <p>  To ensure that the school is kept fully up to date with progress on the project, the County Council has been updating the Board of Management on a monthly basis.  This approach will provide accurate and precise information to help the school to plan and manage its needs until its permanent accommodation is available.</p></reply>

Neither type of CCTV system may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.</p><p>Community CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded. </p><p>Accordingly, the legal requirement for local authorities to act as data controller for the purpose of community CCTV schemes has been in place since 2006.  The Deputy may further wish to be aware that under the 2005 Act, as amended, the relevant secondary legislation is not a matter for me as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Rather, the power to establish the criteria for community CCTV schemes is a matter for the Policing Authority, by order made with the approval of the Government. </p><p>In accordance with this legal framework, I understand that the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes. This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities. I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that on 29 November this year the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office issued a note (available on its website <i>www.dataprotection.ie</i>) confirming that there is a legal basis for community based CCTV and that the General Data Protection Regulation does not introduce new barriers in that regard.  In particular, the Office in its note confirmed that: &ldquo;Data protection legislation does not stand in the way of the roll-out of Community based CCTV schemes that have been authorised by the Garda Commissioner. Once the local authority in the administrative area concerned is willing to take on and deliver on its responsibilities as a data controller for the schemes concerned, there is no legal impediment under data protection legislation to the scheme commencing.&rdquo;</p><p>In relation to the question of monitoring, as raised by the Deputy, the Data Protection Commission has explicitly confirmed that local authorities are not required, as a result of their role as data controller, to monitor CCTV live feeds on a continuous basis. </p><p>The Data Protection Commission is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV as part of a wider inquiry into surveillance through the use of technologies forlaw enforcement purposes.  We expect the findings from the CCTV module of this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities. </p><p>My Department is also engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, to clarify any queries arising and to assist in resolving any concerns.</p><p>Finally, in relation to the question of funding: my Department does not provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake their legal responsibilities as data controllers. Local Authorities expenditure is funded from a variety of sources.</p><p>However the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In furtherance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department.  In total, funding of &euro;1 million is available each year for three years.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p><p>Funding provided by my Department under this grant aid scheme has been aimed at the capital cost of establishing community CCTV schemes which meet the statutory requirements.  Local authorities are not prohibited from applying for these grants and indeed a number of local authorities have been approved for funding under the current scheme. </p><p>There have to date been 27 applications to the scheme. 20 applications have been approved for grants totalling more than &euro;500,000.  A further 4 applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered. The remaining 3 applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.</p><p>I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, have the opportunity to take advantage of the availability of this grant aid scheme. If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie</i>and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address <i>communitycctv@justice.ie</i></p></reply>

These include reducing the gender pay gap, assisting the return of women to the labour market and promoting female entrepreneurship.</p><p>Many of these commitments are being progressed under the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020, which is being implemented under the guidance of a Strategy Committee chaired by me.  </p><p>The Strategy provides the framework for action on women's equality, including in the workplace.  It includes commitments to tackle particular challenges which remain for women in the workplace, among which are the continued under-representation of women in business leadership and senior decision-making, the gender gaps in labour market participation and in pay, and the underrepresentation of women in apprenticeships and in many occupations and sectors, particularly those requiring science, technology, engineering or mathematical skills.</p><p>The Government has reflected these challenges in the priorities to be addressed in the Strategy, with the advancement of socio-economic equality for women and girls identified as one of its six high-level objectives.  45 of the 139 actions in the Strategy are contributing to this objective. The Strategy is published by my Department on <i></i>where periodic progress updates will be available in due course.</p><p>Among the significant developments under the Strategy this year has been the establishment in July of the Better Balance for Better Business Review Group, a business-led initiative to advise on how more women can be involved in decision-making at the top level of businesses in Ireland, and the advancement of draft Government legislation requiring employers to publish information on the gender pay gap in their firms. Work is also continuing on the phased implementation of the new Affordable Childcare Scheme to support parents with the cost of quality childcare.</p><p>The Strategy builds on an extensive body of legislation to address discrimination and promote equality of opportunity for women and men which has progressively developed since equal pay legislation was introduced in the mid-1970s. This legislation has prohibited discrimination and harassment in employment on the basis of gender and family status, among other protected grounds. It also provides for means of redress for complainants in such situations. It encompasses employment equality, equal pay, maternity protection and parental leave legislation, as well as provision for the establishment of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Workplace Relations Commission. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (www.ihrec.ie), whose statutory functions include providing information to the public in relation to human rights and equality, has published guidance on rights and duties under this legislation. </p></reply>

Second Stage (D&aacute;il) took place on 31 January and 1 February 2017.  Committee Stage is set for Wednesday 19 December 2018 in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  There are a number of amendments to be brought forward at Committee Stage, most of which are technical in nature.  One of the key amendments proposed is to increase the employment target of persons with disabilities in the public sector from 3% to 6% on a phased basis by 2024.</p>  <p>  The Disability Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2016 includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the CRPD. It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process.</p>  <p>  The monitoring framework will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the National Disability Authority (NDA) and will be governed by a formal Memorandum of Understanding. The IHREC Act 2014 was designed to ensure that IHREC, as Ireland&rsquo;s National Human Rights Institution, fully meets the standard of independence in accordance with the Paris Principles, and is best placed to make periodic independent reports to the UN, supported by progress assessments and statistical information supplied by the NDA. The NDA has expertise and information resources in relation to reporting on disability issues.</p>  <p>  The Convention and the Optional Protocol cover a broad range of commitments some of which require substantive cultural change such as those relating to de-congregation, personalised budgets and deprivation of liberty.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the terms of the Convention will be one of sustained and ongoing improvement.  Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the convention's requirements.  Accordingly, the Optional Protocol is not being ratified at this time but will be ratified at the earliest opportunity following completion of Ireland's first reporting cycle, which will identify any additional actions needed to ensure the highest possible level of compliance with the Convention.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Scheme, the Tribunal is entirely independent in the matter of individual decisions on applications for compensation. </p>  <p>  Tribunal members, who are practising barristers and practising solicitors in the Courts system, provide their services on a part time basis to the Tribunal.  I have ensured that a full Tribunal membership has been maintained in order to continue to address claims as promptly as possible within the funds available.</p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that while applications are processed with the minimum of formality compared to court proceedings where compensation is being claimed under the Civil Liability Acts, in making their decisions Tribunal Members must be satisfied that all supporting documentation submitted is in order.  </p>  <p>  In some cases there can be delays pending the availability of all required documentation, for example a Garda Report or further supporting documentation from the applicant.  In the case of serious injury to the victim, it can take considerable time (and in some cases years) before a treating consultant is in a position to give a final prognosis.  Accordingly, the processing time for each case can vary widely.  </p>  <p>  Insofar as average processing times are concerned, I can inform the Deputy that I have requested an assessment of the caseload of the Tribunal and have asked my officials to examine this assessment and seek the views of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal in this regard.  I will contact the Deputy with further information in due course.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that, in view of the length of time since the Scheme was last revised, my Department has submitted a request for a review of the Scheme to the Law Reform Commission (LRC) for consideration in the context of its Programme of Law Reform.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in view of a number of large value awards in the current year, I can inform the Deputy that I have obtained approval for an increased allocation of &euro;2.4m, for 2018, as part of a Supplementary Estimate for the Vote which will bring the total compensation allocation to &euro;6.416m.</p></reply>

This accommodation is for those seeking international protection, namely asylum seekers. </p>  <p>  This call sought expressions of interest from parties who would be interested in providing accommodation and related services on an urgent and emergency basis. This was issued in response to the urgent and unforeseen demand for accommodation and related services from those persons arriving in the state seeking international protection. </p>  <p>  The criteria against which the Department assessed the offers of accommodation were availability, standard of property, ability to provide communal social spaces for residents, ability to cater at mealtimes and proximity to required various services. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that these premises were offered to the Department by individual contractors across the country. The Department did not randomly choose any one location over another location. </p>  <p>  Following on-site assessments carried out by staff in the Department, the offer of the Caislean Mara hotel in Moville, Co. Donegal was deemed to be suitable premises for the needs of the Department. At that time, the premises was available, capable of providing meals to residents and has scope to provide the required communal social areas required by residents.</p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of negotiations between the Department and the Contractor, all local councillors and elected members of the Oireachtas were contacted.  It was not possible to begin consultations earlier as the Department did not know until such negotiations were completed that it would be possible to use the facility.  Officials from my Department also attended an information meeting in Moville with the local community which was attended also by local Councillors and elected members of the Oireachtas.  This meeting provided an opportunity to answer questions on the centre from members of the local community.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that since then, the hotel was the subject of an arson attack which has caused some damage to the reception area and some bedrooms. I have repeatedly condemned this attack and I do so again. While this attack will inevitably cause a delay in the opening of the accommodation centre, officials from the Reception and Integration Agency in my Department remain in close contact with their colleagues in the HSE and the Departments of Education and Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The purpose behind this is to ensure that any issues that arise are addressed as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. While the Citizenship Division endeavours to ensure that most straightforward cases are processed to a decision within six months, this has to be seen in the context of the work involved in dealing with volumes of applications, some of which can be very complex in nature, and the need to ensure that each applicant fulfils the statutory conditions for naturalisation. The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks may take a considerable period of time.  </p>  <p>  In this case information has been received which requires further consideration and the application cannot proceed until this process is concluded. As the Deputy will appreciate, it is essential that all relevant information is considered so that a fully informed decision on any citizenship application can be made. This does not mean that an application decision is held up indefinitely. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department will revert to the applicant if further information is required.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy will be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate&rsquo;s Review of Entry-Routes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which was published in July 2018, proposes extending the existing reciprocal arrangements with the PSNI to allow access to the Sergeant and Inspector promotion processes in both jurisdictions (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI). The report by the Commission on the Future of Policing endorses this recommendation and the related recommendation that reciprocal arrangements with other police services should also be explored. </p><p>I am supportive of extending the existing reciprocal arrangements with the PSNI to allow access to the Sergeant and Inspector promotion processes in both jurisdictions, however there are a number of practical issues which need to be addressed, for example the need for training and the requirement to pass the Sergeants and Inspectors promotional examinations which are largely based on Irish Law. I have asked my officials to consider these issues in consultation with the Commissioner.</p><p>The Inter-Governmental Agreement on Police Co-operation obliged both Governments to introduce the necessary administrative and legislative measures to provide for exchanges, secondments and appointments between the Garda S&iacute;ochana and the PSNI. Section 52 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 gives effect to this obligations.</p><p>The Act provides for the secondment from the PSNI to certain ranks in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a period not exceeding 3 years. Protocols are in place between the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI which provide for the implementation of a programme of personnel exchanges and secondments between the two police services. </p><p>As regards secondments, I am informed that one member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was seconded to the PSNI since 2005 with the same powers and duties as a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. No members of the PSNI have been seconded to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>As regards personnel exchanges, for the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out in the following table the number and Rank of members from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of the PSNI that have taken part in personnel exchanges for each year since 2005, and the duration of each exchange, as supplied by the Garda Commissioner.</p><p><b>Number and Rank of members from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of the PSNI that have taken part in personnel exchanges for each year since 2005 and the duration of each.</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>AGS to PSNI </th><th>Duration of Exchange</th><th>PSNI to AGS</th><th>Duration of Exchange</th></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>1 Superintendent  </td><td>2 months</td><td>1 Superintendent</td><td>2 months</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>2 Superintendents1 Garda</td><td>2 months</td><td>1 Superintendent</td><td>2 months</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>3 Sergeant 6 Garda&iacute;</td><td>2 months</td><td>3 Inspectors2 Sergeants8 Constables</td><td>2 months</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>4 Sergeants13 Garda&iacute;</td><td>2 months</td><td>1 Chief Superintendent4 Inspectors2 Sergeants6 Constables</td><td>2 months</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>2 Sergeants9 Garda&iacute;6 Garda&iacute;</td><td>2 months<br /><br />1 month</td><td>2 Inspectors2 Sergeants2 Constables2 Sergeants3 Constables</td><td>2 months<br /><br />1 month</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>2 Inspectors5 Sergeants8 Garda&iacute;</td><td>1 month</td><td>2 Inspectors3 Sergeants13 Constables</td><td>1 month</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>7 Sergeants8 Garda&iacute;</td><td>1 month</td><td>1 Inspector3 Sergeants12 Constables</td><td>1 month</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>1 Inspector3 Sergeants5 Garda&iacute;</td><td>1 month</td><td>4 Sergeants3 Constables</td><td>1 month</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>1 Sergeant4 Garda&iacute;</td><td>1 month</td><td>1 Constable</td><td>1 month</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>Nil</td><td>N/A</td><td>2 Constables</td><td>2 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>6 Sergeants2 Garda&iacute;</td><td>2 Weeks</td><td>5 Constables3 Sergeants1 Inspector</td><td>2 Weeks</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>5 Sergeants5 Garda&iacute;</td><td>2 weeks</td><td>1 Inspector2 Sergeants2 Constables</td><td>2 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>8 Garda&iacute;</td><td>3 weeks</td><td>1 Sergeant7 Constables</td><td>3 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>1 Sergeant6 Garda&iacute;</td><td>3 weeks</td><td>1 Sergeant5 Constables</td><td>3 weeks</td></tr><tr><td>*Total To Date</td><td>124</td><td></td><td>111</td><td></td></tr></table>*As of 3 December 2018</p></reply>

The Deputy will also be aware that there have been a number of recent Court judgements which have implications for transferring prisoners from other States to Ireland. These judgements raised a number of complex issues about the legislation and its administration, indicating that legislative change is required.</p>  <p>  My Department is at present finalising a draft scheme of a Bill to bring forward such changes.  This draft scheme will be brought to Government as soon as possible</p>  <p>  The Convention recognises that international co-operation in criminal law should further the ends of justice and social rehabilitation of prisoners and that this may be best achieved by having them transferred to serve their sentences in their own countries.  The Minister of the day has discretion under the Transfer of Persons Acts to decide whether to consent to any such transfer.</p>  <p>  A number of factors, including the Supreme Court Judgment in the case of O'Farrell, McDonald, Rafferty -v-The Governor of Portlaoise Prison, have implications for the continuance in its present form of the process operated by the Irish Prison Service for transferring prisoners from other States to Ireland. </p>  <p>  That judgment found against the State and raised a number of complex issues about the legislation itself and its administration.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Court of Appeal decision in the case M.McK v The Minister for Justice and Equality [2016] IEHC 208, has clarified that the Minister should ultimately consider each application on its own merits and give detailed reasoning for the decision reached. </p>  <p>  The judgment also concludes that the Minister cannot fail to implement legislation through prolonged inactivity of a statutory scheme such as the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts.  As the Deputy is aware, following the judgment, all existing applications have been reactivated and will be re-considered on their own merits.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that there are currently 27 cases with 8 being processed from applicants from outside the UK jurisdiction. Each case is at a different stage of the application process and all cases require the collation of a number of reports, e.g. Garda Reports and Probation Service Reports, some of which are still outstanding in a number of these cases.</p></reply>

The scheme provides an additional and effective method for Garda&iacute; to distribute crime prevention information and advice. There are in the region of 200,000 text messages sent under the scheme each month.</p>  <p>  At the Ploughing Championships in September, I announced that &euro;150,000 would be made available for local communities in 2018 towards the cost of running the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I approved &euro;100,00 in funding for these groups in September 2017, which was also announced at that year's Ploughing Championships. This was topped up in December 2017 by a further &euro;50,000. In the end, requests for amounts totalling &euro;125,000 (out of the &euro;150,000 available) were received from Muintir na T&iacute;re and paid out to 441 groups in respect of the full year 2017. </p>  <p>  A payment of between &euro;200-&euro;350 was made to each group in 2017 to offset the costs incurred by these local groups, where this spend could be supported with documentation. It has been open to groups who have incurred expenditure related to the scheme to provide supporting documentation to Muintir na T&iacute;re and to seek payment and that remains the case for 2018.</p>  <p>  The Garda authorities indicate that Text Alert has been a highly effective crime prevention initiative since it was launched in 2013. The proposed rebate scheme, which was developed after consultation with the Garda authorities and detailed discussions with Muintir na T&iacute;re, provides a tangible recognition by the Minister of the considerable voluntary effort which goes into Text Alert and similar community-based schemes and it is in keeping with a commitment in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  In addition to the text alert scheme, I should also mention that, for many years, my Department has supported community crime prevention by providing funding for the Community Alert programme, which is operated by  Muintir na T&iacute;re in partnership with the Garda authorities. My Department does not provide direct funding to local groups, but funding is provided in relation to the employment and associated costs of the national service, including regional Development Officers. The long-standing view has been that this is the best use of the resources available to my Department to support effective community crime prevention actions.</p></reply>

The projected 4,000 civilians represents a medium-term target of 20% of the Garda full-time workforce comprised of civilians. This target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles where their skills can be used to best effect, with the backfilling of these roles by suitably qualified civilians, where necessary. </p>  <p>  Progress is being made in relation to civilianisation. Since the beginning of 2017 approximately 330 new civilian posts have been sanctioned by the Policing Authority with the consent of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The bulk of these were to address critical skills gaps and capacity issues with a proportion sanctioned to make a start on the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing duties. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 3 December, approximately 365 civilians have been recruited to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2018.  Some of these civilian staff were recruited to backfill existing vacancies, some were to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline duties and others were to fill newly created civilian posts to fill skills gaps across the organisation. </p>  <p>  Work is also continuing on an overall redeployment plan and I am informed by Garda management that as of 3 December, almost 200 Garda&iacute; have been reassigned to operational duties and it is expected that the target for 2018 of 250 redeployments will be achieved by year end.  That is an additional 250 Garda&iacute; on the front-line in 2018 over and above those being recruited under the Government's accelerated recruitment programme.  Now that redeployments are happening, I expect that the momentum will increase and that 2019 will see greater numbers of sworn members moving from administrative work to the front-line. </p>  <p>  This is very much in line with the Report of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland which recommends the return of Garda&iacute; to the front line to deliver visible policing.  Later this month, I will bring my substantive response to the Report and a High Level Implementation Plan to Government, for approval.  The twin issues of redeployment and  civilianisation will be prioritised in the High Level Implementation Plan.</p>  <p>  The Third Interim Report of the Disclosures Tribunal suggested a series of obligations as the duty of police personnel.  Among these is an obligation on Garda&iacute; to be visible within the communities they serve.  I am confident that the continuing increase in Garda numbers towards 15,000, the planned increases in the Garda Reserve and the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to the front-line, will together result in increased Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

Neither may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.</p><p>Community CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and</p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.</p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In furtherance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities, can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.</p><p>There have to date been 27 applications to the scheme. 20 applications have been approved, involving approved grants totalling more than &euro;500,000.  A further 4 applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered. The remaining 3 applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.</p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, the location of the CCTV schemes which have been approved for funding to date is as follows:<table><tr><th>County</th><th>No. of Approved Schemes</th></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>1</td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy enquired in relation to the role of local authorities.  As set out above, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006, any proposed community CCTV scheme must have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller. </p><p>In accordance with this legal framework, the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes. This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities. I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that on 29 November this year the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office issued a note (available on its website <i>www.dataprotection.ie</i>) confirming that there is a legal basis for community based CCTV and that the General Data Protection Regulation does not introduce new barriers in that regard.  In particular, the Data Protection Commission confirmed that: &ldquo;Data protection legislation does not stand in the way of the roll-out of Community based CCTV schemes that have been authorised by the Garda Commissioner. Once the local authority in the administrative area concerned is willing to take on and deliver on its responsibilities as a data controller for the schemes concerned, there is no legal impediment under data protection legislation to the scheme commencing.&rdquo;</p><p>The Data Protection Commissioner's Office is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV as part of a wider inquiry into surveillance through the use of technologies for law enforcement purposes.  We expect the findings from the CCTV module of this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities. </p><p>My Department is also engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, to clarify any queries arising and to assist in resolving any concerns.</p><p>This is the case as I am keen to ensure that all interested groups, in both rural and urban areas, have the opportunity to take advantage of the availability of the grant aid scheme.  If the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the scheme, full details of the grant aid package are available to download from my Department's website - <i>www.justice.ie</i>and support and guidance is available to help interested groups to apply for this funding through a dedicated email address <i>communitycctv@justice.ie.</i></p></reply>

I am happy to update the Deputy on developments in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government granted permission to review the 2013 General Scheme by way of Decision of 10 January 2018. </p>  <p>  To advance this review, I chaired an Inter-Departmental Working Group on Gambling, comprising all stakeholder Departments and the Office of the Attorney General. The Group met on 5 occasions between February and June of this year and reviewed all of the provisions of the 2013 Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Group in its deliberations had particular regard to the Government's preference for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority as set out in its Decision of 10 January 2018.  The Group is currently finalising its Report, which I hope to bring to Government for consideration as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. This is an interim reform measure, which I hope will be published before the end of the current Oireachtas session or early in the next Session. The amendments proposed under this Bill address certain deficiencies with regard to the conduct of activities regulated under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, and provide for the modernisation of that Act by way of, among other matters, updating stake and prize limits and standardising the minimum gambling age at 18.</p></reply>

It would not be in the public interest to detail the measures that are taken by our authorities in this area.  What I can say is that considerable resources are deployed by the Garda authorities, supported by the skills and expertise of the Defence Forces, in combating threats to our security. The authorities here work very closely on an on-going basis with their international counterparts in identifying and managing any threats arising.</p></reply>

Therefore, the person concerned should await the outcome of their application for renewal of their permission to remain before any other steps would be taken.

I am also advised that the process of having this application completed has been complicated, and delayed, by the continuing failure of the person concerned to provide definitive, reliable, documentary evidence to attest to their identity and nationality. </p><p>I am further advised that once the relevant personnel in the INIS have satisfied themselves as to the identity and nationality of the person concerned, detailed consideration can be given to their application for renewal of permission to remain. </p><p>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

That is why significant resources have been invested into this area, including through the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan which includes financing measures, new construction and rental sector improvements.  These steps will, first and foremost, ensure that people in Ireland are better able to buy and rent suitable homes.  They will also serve to reinforce our national infrastructure in terms of its capacity to accommodate further foreign direct investment.</p>  <p>  More broadly, it is important to bear in mind that international investors take a long-term view on where they choose to establish a presence. Investors also use a wide range of criteria to inform such decisions.  Our traditional strengths are well known &ndash; including our talented workforce, membership of the EU and pro-enterprise policy environment &ndash; and these critical factors continue, as the healthy pipeline of investment here demonstrates, to make the country an attractive proposition to overseas firms. </p>  <p>  We should not forget either that many of the States that we compete with for investment have challenges of their own &ndash; including in housing &ndash; when it comes to attracting overseas firms.  So while we have infrastructural areas in this country that need further investment and improvement, we are not alone in facing that challenge. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is fully seized of current housing market conditions in Ireland and recognises that this is an important issue for investors.  The Agency&rsquo;s assessments of the housing market are based on a wide range of sources and a combination of indices, with the aim of forming the clearest possible picture of how Irish rents compare internationally.  These information sources are continuously reviewed and contribute to briefings used by IDA staff.  It should be remembered too that the overseas firms that the IDA targets to invest in Ireland &ndash; many of whom are large multinational companies with an existing presence here &ndash; form their own opinions on housing supply and other investment conditions here. </p>  <p>  The media piece in question refers to IDA briefing documents that highlight a number of indices regarding the Irish property market.  They include a 2018 Residential Tenancies Board figure on average rents in Dublin City.  Another index, which was sourced from the Nestpick 2017 Furnished Apartment Index, set out an estimate of the costs of renting small furnished apartments across County Dublin in 2017.  It was not suggested by the IDA that this Nestpick index was an authoritative figure for the entire Dublin property market.</p></reply>

These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months.  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging.  With Brexit around the corner, I want business to know my Department and agencies are here to help. </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies, have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign, including workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and devised a communications campaign, as well as an online "Brexit SME Scorecard" to help Irish businesses self-assess their exposure to Brexit and a "Be Prepared Grant" to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.  As part of awareness-raising activities, EI has rolled out regional Brexit Advisory clinics throughout the year.   </p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland's Brexit advisory service was established in May 2017 to provide a focal point for SMEs working to navigate the changes in cross-Border trading relationships brought about by Brexit negotiations. </p>  <p>  Local Enterprise Office funding has been increased and this increase is being used to assist micro-enterprises in becoming more competitive and better able to cope with the changing environment in which they are operating.  The suite of LEO Brexit supports includes tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges and targeted training on specific Brexit challenges.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched in April 2018 and provides affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future, to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenge. </p>  <p>  In May 2018, the Rescue and Restructuring scheme was extended to include temporary restructuring aid for enterprises experiencing acute liquidity needs.  The aid is granted in the form of loans repayable over a period of 18 months.  Together with the Brexit Loan Scheme, this temporary restructuring aid will provide valuable stabilisation to businesses as they respond to the immediate and long-term impacts of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  It will provide low cost loans for terms of between 8-10 years, which is not readily available on the market.  It is expected that this scheme will be operational in Q1 2019.</p>  <p>  I will continue to ensure we provide the supports and services best suited to the needs of enterprise over the coming months.</p></reply>

I am confident that the agencies under my remit have the supports available to enable companies to consolidate existing market share and build resilience by broadening their exports to other international markets.   </p>  <p>  Since the outcome of the 2016 referendum in the UK, my Department has been preparing for Brexit.  In 2017 for example, we outlined our approach to Brexit in the Report entitled &ldquo;Building Stronger Business&rdquo; which identified the anticipated impacts of Brexit on the enterprise sector.  Since then, my Department with its agencies has continued to work on Brexit preparedness and contingency planning, putting in place a range of supports to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by Brexit.  Our Enterprise Agencies are at the forefront of these efforts. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland, an agency of my Department, continues to focus on converting interest shown from companies into investing in Ireland in key sectors including financial services, bio-pharma, technology and business services.  It is making steady progress winning investments and is confident that we will see more Brexit related investments. </p>  <p>  As highlighted in a Copenhagen Economics study commissioned by my Department and published earlier this year, limited opportunities from Brexit may arise, mainly concentrated in the financial services sector and some other business services.  Financial Services is a key sector where Ireland has considerable strengths.  IDA Ireland is taking a targeted but realistic approach to pursuing these opportunities and this is being done in the context of upholding regulatory standards that apply in Ireland managed by the Central Bank.  IDA Ireland estimate that more than 40 companies have decided to either expand their existing operations or establish their first presence in Ireland as a consequence of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has an extensive range of supports to encourage clients to become more competitive, innovative and to diversify export markets and have put in place a suite of supports to assist companies.  These include initiatives such as the Brexit scorecard to help companies assess their Brexit exposure, a Be Prepared grant of up to &euro;5,000 to prepare a Brexit action plan, dedicated Brexit Advisory clinics organized countrywide and a Short Term loan facility of &euro;300m.</p>  <p>  In addition, EI is implementing extensive trade mission and event schedules aimed on further developing in-market expertise and networks, new sectoral opportunities and stimulating demand for Irish products and services through international marketing campaigns.  These efforts are underpinned by the Eurozone Strategy launched by EI in 2017 to increase exports to Eurozone countries by 50% by 2020.</p>  <p>  Key to my Department's response to Brexit has been extensive consultation with stakeholders across all sectors of the economy.  Detailed research has been carried out to help the Government decide how to best respond to the challenges of Brexit.  Several important steps have already been taken to prepare our economy, including through a range of measures aimed at building resilience and providing new opportunities to business announced in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019.  </p>  <p>  Most recently, in Budget 2019, we have introduced additional measures to assist businesses, complimenting existing Brexit supports.  These include the Future Growth Loan Scheme to provide longer-term lending to support capital investment by businesses; an additional &euro;5 million to the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) to enhance the programme of supports which they provided at local level, including training in customs procedures for businesses; an additional &euro;8 million for the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies in their efforts to support businesses; an extra &euro;1 million in capital funding to InterTradeIreland to assist companies trading on an all Island basis and, a doubling of the Retail Online Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25 million to assist companies to build an online presence.    </p>  <p>  This Government is also focused on sustaining and creating new employment opportunities.  Building on the success of the Action Plan for Jobs, the recently launched Future Jobs programme represents the next phase of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development.  The Future Jobs strategy sets out longer-term ambitions for the future of the economy, taking account of the challenges facing us, including Brexit.  We want the economy to sustainably grow in the years ahead and embrace new technologies.  It is designed to secure our enterprise base and secure Ireland&rsquo;s long-term economic prosperity.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that across a range of supports and initiatives, work of my Department and its agencies is focused on supporting businesses throughout the country to withstand current challenges and succeed into the future.</p></reply>

We also retained our position in the Global Innovation Index, ranking 10th out of 126 countries.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology, Innovation 2020, articulates Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to become a Global Innovation Leader, identifying priority themes, which have been revised to reflect the impact of technological change and digitisation.</p><p>A report published by my Department in October 2018,<i>&lsquo;</i>The Research and Development Budget (R&amp;amp;D) 2017 &ndash; 2018&rsquo; presents the latest available data on the Government Research and Development (R&amp;amp;D) Budget and on Ireland&rsquo;s R&amp;amp;D expenditure across all sectors.  </p><p>It reports that Government Budget Allocations for R&amp;amp;D (GBARD) in 2017 was &euro;739.3m, an increase of 2.8% in expenditure over the previous year.  It also reports that a total of 36,087 personnel (full-time equivalents) were working in R&amp;amp;D in 2016.  Of these, 18,203 were working in the business sector, 1,891 in the higher education sector and 933 in the Government sector.</p><p>My Department, through its agencies Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), Enterprise Ireland (EI) and IDA Ireland supports both business and higher education sectors RDI activities.  My Department is also making significant investments to develop the national ecosystem of research and technology centres.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s continued economic growth and prosperity depends on maintaining and indeed increasing investment across the broad science, technology and innovation spectrum.</p><p>My commitment to continuing support for innovation can be evidenced by the increase in my Department&rsquo;s 2019 innovation budget to &euro;368.95m &ndash; an increase of &euro;40.25m over 2018.  This will be spent over a range of initiatives and programmes that advance innovation and facilitate opportunities for Irish interests on EU and world markets.  SFI and EI R&amp;amp;D programmes account for over 80% of my Department&rsquo;s innovation budget.  SFI and EI will continue to leverage EU and private sector funding for research programmes, building on successes to date.</p><p>A specific innovation programme is Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), managed by EI, which enables public sector bodies to connect with innovative ideas and technology businesses, to provide innovative solutions for specific public-sector challenges and needs.  10 SBIR challenges have issued in 2018 with a further HSE suite of challenges expected before year end.</p><p>Of particular innovative relevance in the 2019 budget is the allocation of &euro;20m for Phase I of the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund, which has a total fund of &euro;500m as set out in Project Ireland 2040.  This fund is about exploiting research to deliver new technologies and new solutions.  It will incentivise collaborations between companies, colleges and other public-sector bodies to deploy disruptive technology in Ireland, in ways that will create entirely new companies and even new sectors in due course.</p><p>The budget also includes an additional &euro;10m in 2019 as part of a &euro;100m dedicated PhD/Masters training programme through SFI in areas aligned to enterprise needs. An additional &euro;5m in 2019 is specifically allocated for the renewal of six of SFI&rsquo;s world-leading research centres.  SFI engage in excellent research with industry and to date this has resulted in over 600 contracts with industry, &euro;150m of industry co-funding and &euro;170m of competitively won funding from Europe. </p><p>There is also assistance available from the European Union.  Horizon 2020 is the instrument that supports collaborative R&amp;amp;D in Europe.  Irish companies that compete successfully for funding from Horizon 2020 will boost their innovation capability and competitiveness, which in turn, will deliver strong national economic impacts, including job creation and increases in sales and exports.  My agencies provide support to their client companies in this application process.  Ireland has secured over &euro;630m research funding through the current Horizon 2020 programme and remains on course to achieve its ambitious target of &euro;1.25b in research funding by the conclusion of the programme.  </p><p>However, notwithstanding all these innovation supports, more needs to be done.  Technological change is already impacting several sectors, such as manufacturing, finance, retail and transport.  These changes will present both challenges and new opportunities - certain job roles will disappear or be redefined and brand-new job roles will appear requiring new and different skillsets.  Technological innovation is radically transforming our lives, and this will continue.</p><p>I am aware that we need to work now to position Ireland to prepare for and respond to these changes.  For Ireland to be at the frontier of technological developments we must both encourage and facilitate innovation across sectors and firms - by increasing investment in RD&amp;amp;I and promoting strong links between enterprise and the research community, both nationally and internationally. </p><p>To this end, my Department, along with the Department of the Taoiseach, is currently developing the Future Jobs Initiative, a new cross-Government strategy to guide the next phase of Ireland&rsquo;s economic development.  The focus is on quality jobs, improving productivity and building a resilient and innovative economy.  Innovation and technological change is one of the five key pillars and this focus will have a positive impact on the innovation ecosystem.</p></reply>

A key objective of the initiative is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the aim of having the unemployment rate of each region within one per cent of the national average.</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment across the State since Q1 2015 to Q3 2018, with 163,500 people in the regions outside of Co. Dublin entering employment in that period.  That is over 63% - or 3 out of every 5 jobs created &ndash; were for regions outside of Co. Dublin (Q1 2015 &ndash; Q3 2018).  In the year from Q3 2017 &ndash; Q3 2018, just over half (51%) of the jobs created were outside of Co. Dublin.</p>  <p>  In April of this year, I asked all the RAPJ committees and other regional stakeholders to start a process to Refresh and Refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020.  The Refresh and Refocus will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country and can be robust to address the challenges we face, including Brexit. </p>  <p>  All Regions have established a Project Delivery Team, which has met to examine initial proposals for each Region&rsquo;s Strategic Objectives and all Regions now have a working draft of their refreshed Plans.  The refreshed Regional Plans aim to be completed by the end of the year.</p>  <p>The IDA   has performed very strongly over the last 12 months and it is a huge achievement that there are now over 210,000 people employed in IDA Ireland client companies. </p>  <p>  The fact that it has surpassed its overall five-year target of 209,000 within three years is further evidence of the Agency&rsquo;s success in growing the level of employment by multinationals here.  I am especially pleased to see that of the 237 overseas investments made in 2017, a record number of 111 were from new companies investing in Ireland for the first time.  This reflects the health of the pipeline of foreign direct investment (FDI) here.  </p>  <p>  The Agency has maintained &ndash; if not bettered &ndash; its strong performance from 2017 into 2018.  Regions outside of Dublin have had some high-profile job announcements including 600 jobs in the Mid-West at Edwards Life Sciences and 400 new jobs promised for Dundalk by Chinese life sciences company Wuxi Biologics.  There were also two significant announcements in Longford in Avery Dennison and Red Seal Sups, bringing 300 jobs to the Midlands region. </p>  <p>  The global investment climate, we should remember, is becoming ever more competitive.  Our collective ability to continue winning new overseas investment for Ireland is therefore a testament to both the work of the IDA and the strength of our offering to multinational companies. </p>  <p>Enterprise Ireland supports approximately 5,000 companies and a total of 209,338 people are now employed in those companies.  Despite the challenges and uncertainty created by Brexit, there are also many opportunities and Irish companies have continued to win sales around the world that have supported strong job creation across all regions of Ireland. </p>  <p>  19,332 new jobs were created by Enterprise Ireland backed companies in 2017, with 64% of these jobs created in regions outside of Dublin.  There was employment growth in every sector and every county.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice, guidance, financial assistance and soft supports such as training and mentoring to those wishing to start or grow their own business. </p>  <p>  In 2017, the LEOs supported 7,182 client companies employing 37,485 people.  They created 7,135 new jobs with a net increase of 3,760 jobs.  The LEOs provided mentoring to 8,393 clients in 2017 and 30,373 people took part in training provided by the LEOs.</p>  <p>  My Department also supports InterTrade Ireland (ITI), the cross-border trade and business development body.  Funding for ITI is jointly provided by my Department and our Northern Ireland counterpart, the Department for the Economy.  Through its innovation and trade initiatives, ITI helps small businesses in Ireland and Northern Ireland to explore new cross-border markets and develop new products, processes and services which help improve capability as well as driving competitiveness, growth and jobs.  With the launch of the Brexit Advisory Service in May 2017, InterTrade Ireland is also helping companies to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU through a range of supports and services.  ITI is a small organisation but with a big outreach; to date, the body has assisted over 39,000 companies, created or protected over 14,000 jobs and supported over &euro;1.2bn in additional business development value for small businesses across the island.</p></reply>

Figures show that employment continues to grow strongly with 66,700 jobs created in the year from Q3 2017 to Q3 2018. This brings total employment to 2,273,000. </p>  <p>  The number of people in employment has increased in six of the eight regions in the year from Q3 2017 to Q3 2018.  The exception to this is the Mid-West (which has remained static) and the Border region.</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment across the State since Q1 2015 to Q3 2018, with 163,500 people in the regions outside of Co.

The Refresh and Refocus will ensure that the Plans are more focused and effective, and are robust to address the challenges we face, including Brexit. </p>  <p>  I met with the Chairpersons of the RAPJ Committees in October to hear directly about the progress made on the Refresh of the Plans to date. All Regions have established a Project Delivery Team, which has met to examine initial proposals for each Region&rsquo;s Strategic Objectives and all Regions now have a working draft of their refreshed Plans.The refreshed Regional Plans aim to be completed by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  My Department is also working closely with the agencies (IDA, EI and the LEOs) and other relevant stakeholders, and their ongoing regional activities will also be included in the Plans. </p>  <p>  On Monday the 3rd December, under the second call of my Department's Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) managed by Enterprise Ireland, I announced an allocation of just over &euro;29 million in funding that will support regions throughout the country to deliver on their economic and enterprise development potential. A total of 21 projects from all over the country received funding under this second call.  This is in addition to the 21 projects that were approved &euro;30.5 million in funding under Call 1 of the REDF announced in December 2017.</p>  <p>  The REDF is aimed at accelerating economic recovery in all regions of the country by delivering on the potential of local and regional enterprise strengths.  The Fund has supported significant collaborative and innovative regional initiatives to build on specific industry sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation.  This will be achieved by co-financing the development and implementation of collaborative and innovative projects that can sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.  The Fund will help to ensure the benefits of our growing economy are felt in all regions.</p></reply>

Innovation is an essential element to maintaining competitiveness, providing jobs and sustaining growth.  My Department&rsquo;s innovation budget for 2019 has been increased by &euro;40m to almost &euro;369m and will fund a range of initiatives and programmes that advance innovation and facilitate opportunities for Irish interests on the European and world stages.  </p>  <p>The &euro;500m Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund (DTIF) is being implemented through my Department and its agencies, working with other research funding bodies to develop Ireland&rsquo;s innovation ecosystem and responsiveness.  The fund will see investment in the development and deployment of disruptive innovative technologies and applications, on a commercial basis, targeted at tackling national and global challenges.  In 2019, &euro;20m has been allocated to DTIF in Phase 1.  Furthermore, an additional allocation of &euro;10m in 2019 has been included as part of the dedicated &euro;100m PhD and Masters training programme through Science Foundation Ireland in areas aligned to enterprise needs.</p>  <p>  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) initiative is a central pillar of the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, 135,000 of which are outside of Dublin.

The Refresh and Refocus will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country and can be robust to address the challenges we face, including Brexit. </p>  <p>  Yesterday, on 3rd December, I was delighted to announce in Navan just over &euro;29 million in funding by my Department through Enterprise Ireland under Call 2 of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF).  This funding has been awarded to 21 regional projects all around the country, bringing the total amount of funding awarded under the two Calls of this scheme to &euro;60 million across 42 regional projects, in all regions.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, IDA Ireland has been working towards regional development targets set out in their strategy for the period between 2015-2019.  This includes a goal of increasing investment in every region of Ireland by 30%-40%.  Real progress is being made towards that objective. In 2017, for example, 45% of all jobs created were based outside of Dublin.  The Agency is working hard to increase that percentage further.</p>  <p>  I know the IDA and its staff are working, on a daily basis, to secure new investment and jobs for regional areas.  It is encouraging to note, for example, that in the first three quarters of 2018 there were 461 site visits and over half of these visits were to regional locations.  This helps show the ongoing efforts being made by the Agency to showcase regional sites to prospective investors. </p>  <p>  However, we must remember that the ultimate decision as to where to invest is always taken by the company itself.  I understand the focus placed on site visits and it is the case that they represent a useful tool by which the merits of regional locations can be showcased to investors.  At the same time, it must be borne in mind that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA Ireland client companies.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2019 also saw the Agency allocated an additional &euro;10m for the Regional Property Programme (RPP).  This will help ensure that property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding, thereby encouraging more FDI to the regions.  The IDA plans to develop new buildings in regional locations including Carlow, Dundalk, Monaghan, Sligo, Athlone, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.</p>  <p>  19,332 new jobs were created by Enterprise Ireland backed companies in 2017, with 64% of these jobs created in regions outside of Dublin.  There was employment growth in every sector and every county. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2019, I allocated an extra &euro;8m to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department, who work with firms at the coalface to develop their supports for business.  I allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland to enhance our Global Footprint.  This will help companies to diversify into new markets as the UK leaves the EU.  &euro;2.75m will also be allocated to Enterprise Ireland to fund a support programme of Regional Innovation and Technology Clusters.</p>  <p>  I have also allocated &euro;1.8m to the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland over 3 years to expand marketing and development programmes to support Irish designers and makers to exhibit at international trade fairs, to develop partnerships with flagship retailers, and to develop e-commerce capacity.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for providing advice, and guidance, financial assistance and soft supports such as training and mentoring to those wishing to start or grow their own business. </p>  <p>  The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories: Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea); Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up); and Business Development Grants for existing businesses that want to expand.</p>  <p>  The LEOs have been allocated an additional &euro;5m for 2019 and this will allow them to focus resources on specific platforms: Building Locally &ndash; a proposal to establish a competitive fund to support high quality proposals in that context; Sustaining and Growing Existing Microenterprises &ndash; an additional resource with a focus on key clients with growth potential or in need of devising a plan to counteract the impacts of Brexit; Brexit and Customs implications/impacts - training and awareness programmes to support firms throughout the country, in all regions, in the area of both Import and Export customs implications and procedures.</p>  <p>  My Department also supports InterTradeIreland (ITI), the cross-border trade and business development body. Funding for ITI is jointly provided by DBEI and our Northern Ireland counterpart, the Department for the Economy.  Through its innovation and trade initiatives, ITI helps small businesses in Ireland and Northern Ireland to explore new cross-border markets and develop new products, processes and services which help improve capability as well as driving competitiveness, growth and jobs.  With the launch of the Brexit Advisory Service in May 2017, InterTradeIreland is also helping companies to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU through a range of supports and services.  ITI is a small organisation but with a big outreach; to date, the body has assisted over 39,000 companies, created or protected over 14,000 jobs and supported over &euro;1.2bn in additional business development value for small businesses across the island. </p>  <p>  To support this important work, my Department will provide an additional &euro;1 million in capital funding to ITI in 2019.  This funding will enable the body to engage with more of the companies that are seeking its support through the Brexit Advisory Service, as well as meeting demand for existing programmes which are all designed to promote and support cross-border trade.</p></reply>

Improving competitiveness performance is a core focus for Government, and as part of this work my Department, its agencies and the National Competitiveness Council are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to strengthen our international competitiveness.</p>  <p>  In its 2017 Competitiveness Challenge Report, the Council has identified a range of threats to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness, including the potential impact of Brexit, the concentration of our export markets and the range of products and services exported.</p>  <p>  At firm level, Enterprise Ireland (EI) actively supports firms to develop new products and services for new and existing markets.  EI&rsquo;s Strategy 2017-20 &ldquo;Build Scale-Expand Reach&rdquo; looks to increase the reach of its client company exports, with two-thirds of exports going beyond the UK.  To broaden the export footprint across the globe, the EI Strategy focuses on training and supports to enhance management capability, leadership and productivity, marketing/sales skills, innovation and R&amp;D, access to funding to help companies to build market share and create new market opportunities.</p>  <p>  Sustaining and growing jobs and diversifying the export base is a challenge when aligned with the key objective of reducing the overall dependence on the UK market as a percentage of overall exports.  Therefore, my Department has allocated additional funding in 2017, 2018 and 2019 to enable EI achieve its objectives.</p>  <p>  Extra staff has been placed in EI&rsquo;s overseas offices with sectoral knowledge and expertise such as in engineering, food, life sciences and construction. Also, in Budget 2019 I allocated an extra &euro;3 million to EI to help it to diversify our Global Footprint.  This will drive export growth to international markets where there are known opportunities and reduce reliance on the UK. </p>  <p>  There is now a major focus on directing resources and expertise to the Eurozone markets where EI sees opportunities, targeting a 50% increase in exports by 2020.  A new &lsquo;Irish Advantage&rsquo; communications campaign is targeting Eurozone buyers to buy Irish innovation in key Brexit impacted sectors.</p>  <p>  There are also significant opportunities in various other international markets for quality Irish goods and services.  The future relative importance and forecasted growth rates of China, India, the South-East Asian countries, the Gulf States, Latin America and Africa combined with the scale of these markets means we will support Irish companies to continue to work to build exports in these markets.  In January of this year, EI launched its new Market Discovery Fund to help more Irish companies accelerate their market diversification efforts.</p>  <p>  A more diverse export base can reduce exposure to external demand shocks, exchange rate fluctuations and instability in export earnings and enhance growth and jobs.  I will continue to work with my Department and EI to ensure Irish-based exporters, particularly in exposed sectors such as traditional manufacturing and agri-food, will continue to be supported to scale and diversify sustainably and strategically. </p>  <p>  Innovation remains at the forefront of any business to ensure that they grow and expand to ensure they are at a level to compete on the EU and global markets effectively.  Innovation involves helping companies improve competitiveness by developing new processes, products or services or by modernising and adapting current processes, products or services to bring them to a standard that will allow the company to enter new and existing markets internationally.  Innovation is an essential component in a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain a competitive edge in overseas markets.  EI has a suite of supports available to assist client companies innovate and develop their enterprise.  These supports help new and existing companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable export growth.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-12-04a.712.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018120400078#WRM05600"><p>I am determined to see the numbers of businesses in Ireland led by women grow and for supports to continue to be delivered to businesswomen throughout Ireland.  The deputy can be assured that my Department has a strong focus on the provision of supports and programmes to assist women to lead businesses, whether they are established businesses or new businesses. </p>  <p>  The Government has to lead by example.  Through a concerted effort throughout departments and agencies, the participation by women on State boards has increased over the last few years to 41 per cent. Unfortunately, female representation on corporate boards is lagging far behind. Women currently make up just 18.1 percent of directors of Irish-registered ISEQ20 companies, which is significantly lower than the EU average of 26.2 percent for large publicly-listed companies.</p>  <p>  That is why the Better Balance for Better Business initiative was launched at an event in Government Buildings in July of this year.  The Government has brought together a team of expert leaders to examine and make recommendations as to why there are so few women in senior executive positions and at board level in Irish companies.  The review group will examine the gender mix at the governance and senior management levels in companies, as well as the issues that arise in connection with the appointment of directors and senior management.  Dr Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General of my Department, is one of the leaders on this group alongside Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland and Julie Sinnamon, chief executive of Enterprise Ireland.  The Better Balance for Better Business group will report back with actions for Government and business to increase the percentage of women on corporate boards and in senior management in leading Irish companies.  It will engage with companies to make the case for change and will report annually on its progress.</p>  <p>  Another method to encourage more businesses in Ireland to be led by women is to have businesses start with women at the helm. The 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Ireland data suggest a persistent gender divide in Ireland in the business startup rate in Ireland.  A gender divide is evident in most countries. GEM Ireland data suggests that if the rate of new business owners in Ireland for women was at the rate for men, an extra 8,000 women would have started a business in 2017. So clearly, we have an under-utilised resource, which is contributing and can contribute further to Ireland reaching its economic potential. </p>  <p>  My Department is leading the way in providing a variety of programmes through its agencies to increase the number of women starting businesses and assisting them at every stage, from potential business leaders to women growing their businesses.  My Department published the first National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement in 2014. Action 19 of the policy statement is to promote female entrepreneurship through identification and promotion of female role models, targeted events and awards, support for female entrepreneur networks and promotion of a dedicated area on corporate websites. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been at the forefront of examining the variance in the female to male ratio of start-ups and have put in place measures to address the imbalance.  The Competitive Start Fund (CSF) for Female Entrepreneurs aims to support early stage start-ups.  This programme is specifically for Female Entrepreneurs or female-led start-ups, active in the Manufacturing &amp;amp; Internationally Traded Services sectors including the following subsectors: Internet, Games, Apps, Mobile, SaaS, Cloud Computing, Enterprise Software, Lifesciences, Food, Cleantech and Industrial Products.  The establishment of this programme has resulted in a spill-over effect with increased female participation in other EI programmes.  In 2017, 42 of the 96 businesses in all CSFs were female led.  In 2012, just eight percent of the 97 High-Potential Start Ups (HPSUs) were female-led.  However, in 2017, 28 percent of the total 90 HPSUs were female led.</p>  <p>  As role modelling is particularly important to aspiring female businesswomen, Enterprise Ireland sponsors several key events: </p>  <p>  - Image Business Woman of the Year Awards,</p>  <p>  - Tatler Business Woman of the Year Awards and Conference, </p>  <p>  - Network Ireland Awards and Conference, and</p>  <p>  - Inspirefest, Silicon Republic.      </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland and Network Ireland have run &lsquo;Fuelling Ambition&rsquo; roadshows across Ireland. &lsquo;Lead and Succeed&rsquo; was the theme of this year&rsquo;s roadshow which aims to encourage, support and drive the ambition of female entrepreneurs nationally by showcasing thriving Irish business women and entrepreneurs.  The roadshow incorporated an Elevator Pitch competition and locations visited included Waterford, Kilkenny, Roscommon and Monaghan.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also partners with key providers in providing training and capability development for early stage and establishes entrepreneurs.  It developed a series of female accelerator programmes in partnership with knowledge providers.  These included: </p>  <p>  - Going for Growth with Paula Fitzsimons,  </p>  <p>  - DCU Ryan Academy Female Propeller Programme,</p>  <p>  - NDRC Female Founders Programme, and</p>  <p>  - CIT Female Exxcel Programme.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks.  An important aspect of the networking programme is the promotion of successful female entrepreneurs as role models and the use of mentoring and networking opportunities which aims to build confidence of newly emerging female entrepreneurs and women operating established businesses.</p>  <p>  We have seen progress in the numbers of women availing of many of the Services provided by the LEOs.  For example, in 2017, 57% of participants attending core training programme, such as Start Your Own Business, were female.</p>  <p>  From these actions and supports, it is evident that my Department has a strong focus on supporting female led enterprises.  I want to see the numbers of these businesses increase for the betterment of the business environment and for society in general.</p></reply>

A key factor in achieving this is to ensure we have a coherent innovation ecosystem which is responsive to emerging opportunities and leads to the creation and application of knowledge.  An internationally competitive research system that acts as a magnet and catalyst for talent and industry will also help the development of a world renowned pool of talent in Ireland&rsquo;s public research system and in industry. In the context of an intensely competitive international environment, this helps Ireland remain attractive to investment from both domestic and foreign owned growth businesses. </p>  <p>  The Knowledge Development Box (KDB), introduced in Budget 2016 forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive offering to continue to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and to support Irish owned companies to innovate and to compete effectively on international markets.  The relief was adapted by the introduction of a new certification scheme via the Knowledge Development Box (Certification of Inventions) Act 2017, which eases the qualification process for smaller companies.</p>  <p>  The KDB provides an effective 6.25% rate of corporation tax on profits from certain qualifying assets that are earned by a company, chargeable to corporation tax in the State, to the extent that the assets relate to Research and Development (R&amp;D) undertaken by that company.  Ireland&rsquo;s KDB effective rate is internationally competitive. </p>  <p>  The KDB complements the existing suite of initiatives and supports available to companies that undertake R&amp;D activities in Ireland across the lifecycle of research and development.  These include R&amp;D tax credits, RD&amp;I grant supports, support for technology acquisition (S291A), significant state investments in National Research Centres / knowledge transfer infrastructures, and advisory supports for accessing Horizon 2020 funding.  Taken together, these provide a competitive proposition for business investment. </p>  <p>  As a key part of Ireland's competitive offering as a location of choice from which to do business, the KDB has helped secure investment since its introduction in 2016 and continues to stimulate further investment in R&amp;D activities by both Irish and foreign owned enterprises resulting in a more resilient and sustainable economy.</p></reply>

The 50 organisations included were agreed at the WRC by all parties.  This list did not include North West Hospice in Sligo.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has completed the first phase of their work in relation to the agencies identified as part of the WRC process.  This exercise has shown that of the agencies who returned data, a majority did apply pay reductions of some form.  It also showed that some agencies made some form of pay restoration between 2016 and 2018.  Following constructive engagement with the assistance of the Workplace Relations Commission, an agreement was reached on 2 October between the parties.  Pay restoration will commence with an annual pay increase of up to &euro;1,000 in April 2019 for those employed by the 50 organisations involved in the pilot.  Any outstanding balance will be paid in two equal amounts in 2020 and 2021.   </p>  <p>  It is recognised that some of the remaining organisations will have pay restoration issues also.  A process of engagement to address this will commence in 2019.</p></reply>

The role of the HSE is to provide multi-disciplinary team approach, which includes the provision of health and personal supports required by people with Huntington's disease and incorporates hospital and primary care and community services. </p>  <p>  The HSE funds a range of community services and supports to enable each individual with a disability, including persons with Huntington's disease, to achieve his or her full potential and maximize independence, including living as independently as possible.  Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers. Voluntary agencies provide the majority of services in partnership with and on behalf of the Health Service Executive. These include Assisted Living Services, Therapy Services, Respite Care and the provision of Medical/surgical Aids and Appliances.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care.  This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

This is a result both of out-of-cycle smears and increased uptake generally. This has impacted turnaround times for results of smear tests. Between May and October this year and when compared to the same period in the previous year, CervicalCheck recorded an increase of over 75,000 smear tests being carried out. </p>  <p>  This has led to a backlog in the laboratories that carry out the analysis of each smear sample slide. It is unfortunate and regrettable that results are currently being reported on average around 20 weeks of the test being taken. In a small number of cases this may take longer. The HSE has apologised to patients affected and are doing everything possible to improve this situation as a priority. </p>  <p>  Smear test samples must be sent to the laboratory and transferred onto slides within six weeks of the smear test date.  After six weeks, the sample is deemed expired and cannot be processed. There is no requirement for cytology to be undertaken within a certain amount of time, once the sample has been transferred to a slide.The HSE has advised that the majority of smear test samples are now transferred to slides within the six week timeframe. By way of comparison, from April to October 2018 the rate of expired samples and vials was 0.29%. This compares with 0.25% for the same period in 2017. </p>  <p>  There may be a small number of cases where the vial used to contain the sample expires before the laboratory has an opportunity to carry out the analysis of the sample and in some cases a sample may be insufficient. Although every effort is made to avoid these situations from happening, it is inevitable that cervical screening programmes will sometimes encounter these issues. In such cases, a woman and her GP are advised, by letter from CervicalCheck, of the need for a repeat test three months after the previous test. </p></reply>

Since the publication of the strategy, there has been continued progress on the delivery of eHealth initiatives and the I.H.I. On 30 May 2017, a Commencement Order and Regulations under the Health Identifiers Act 2014 were signed, allowing for the implementation of the Individual Health Identifier.  The IHI is available to GPs for eReferrals and as ICT systems across the health service are upgraded or adopted, they are being readied for I.H.I. implementation.  The HSE have responsibility for implementing the I.H.I. and an implementation plan is in place, with the I.H.I. intended to be phased into a number of national systems on a periodic basis over the coming years.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the E.H.R., the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy outlines strategic actions on eHealth including that of a national Electronic Health Record solution, particularly in the context of the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital development.  A plan for the implementation of an Acute Electronic Health Record in the New Childrens Hospital is currently being drafted. </p>  <p>  The implementation of a national Electronic Health Record and the Individual Health Identifier are challenging long-term programmes within the context of the overall eHealth strategy that will be supported in the years ahead by Sl&aacute;intecare and the National Development Plan.  The IHI and the E.H.R. are key initiatives to support the wider provision of patient safety and patient care in our health service.  There are other actions and requirements that are necessary to assist in public health data collection and patient management, such as the introduction of a health information policy and a waiting list action plan.  Strategic Action 10 of the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy outlines a number of key actions to support putting in place a 'modern eHealth infrastructure and improve data, research and evaluation capabilities'.  Detailed plans are currently being developed by the Sl&aacute;intecare Office in my Department, in collaboration with Department colleagues and health agencies under its aegis.</p>  <p>  Regarding the creation of new contracts with medical professionals, the Government is committed to engaging with the representatives of general practitioners on the development of a package of measures and reforms to modernise the 1989 GMS Contract. The goal is to develop a contractual framework that has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion, disease prevention and for the structured care of chronic conditions, enabling general practitioners to better meet the needs of patients.</p>  <p>  The Department and HSE recommenced engagement with the Irish Medical Organisation in early October on a package of measures comprising service improvements and contractual modernisation and reform.  In line with the long-established approach to such processes, and by agreement of the parties concerned, I am not in a position to give further details at this stage. </p></reply>

Primary legislation is required to expand eligibility to female contraception. My department will undertake detailed consideration of this proposal in 2019.</p>  <p>  The report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution also recommended that improvements should be made in sexual health and relationship education, including the areas of contraception and consent, in primary and post-primary schools, colleges, youth clubs and other organisations involved in education and interactions with young people.</p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, the Government&rsquo;s Sexual Health Strategy (2015-2020) aims to provide comprehensive and age-appropriate sexual health education and information to everyone, to encourage the development of a healthy sexuality throughout life, and create a more supportive culture to support education in all settings. Indeed the Sexual Health Strategy sets out that sexual health education of children and young people is the primary responsibility of parents and should be supported through Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools and by youth organisations and NGOs. </p>  <p>  In line with the ancillary recommendation by the Joint Committee on Health in this area, a comprehensive sexual health and wellbeing education, information, and promotion programme will be developed by my Department and the HSE to raise awareness of sexual health and safer sex.  This will include expanding access to barrier contraception (condoms).  The provision  of Sexual Health and Relationship Education in the school sector will also be enhanced by the strong current working arrangements between the education and health sectors through the Healthy Ireland framework.  The health system will support any improvements or changes to school based Sexual Health and Relationship Education, including those arising from the review underway by the Department of Education.</p></reply>

In effect, everyone pays the same amount of money for the same level of health insurance coverage, regardless of their age or health status. </p>  <p>  Risk equalisation is essential to underpin community rating, as without it insurers with older and sicker customers would be forced to charge higher premiums. It is important to note that risk equalisation is Exchequer neutral: stamp duty is charged on each health insurance contract and redistributed to insurers based on their risk profile.</p>  <p>  The voluntary private health insurance market in Ireland is proportionately one of the largest in the world. Given the fact that over 45% of Irish people hold health insurance, it is appropriate that our health insurance system is community-rated and is supported by risk equalisation.  There is long-standing and cross-party political support for community rating, which is reflected and reaffirmed in the Oireachtas each year during the passage of the Health Insurance Bill. </p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report anticipates that implementation of its reform programme will have an impact on the demand for private health insurance in Ireland, as enhancements and changes are made to the public health system. There is close and robust regulation of the health insurance market on an ongoing basis. In the coming years, we will continue to ensure that the regulatory regime in place is appropriate to the size of the market and to the role played by private health insurance within the healthcare system.  </p></reply>

Each year, 3.3 million patients attend Hospital Outpatient clinics for appointments. While the total numbers on the outpatient waiting list continues to grow, a targeted approach by the HSE in late 2017 and into 2018 has impacted on the level of growth.

This year has seen the NTPF approve almost 12,700 additional first-time outpatient appointments and this is projected to increase to 40,000 appointments next year. In addition, validation will play a key in ensuring the accuracy of the outpatient waiting list, and it is envisioned that 30,000 patients will be removed from the outpatient waiting list through the validation consultation process in 2019. </p><p>The data sought by the Deputy is contained at the following link.</p></reply>

Certification to the EU legislation necessitates that any clinical risks associated with a device are mitigated and reduced as far as possible, and that all risks cumulatively are acceptable when weighed against the clinical benefit. It is important to note that the MAGEC system has also been assessed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK as an effective surgical treatment option for scoliosis, where other treatments such as casting or bracing have failed or are not suitable. </p>  <p>  Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin (OLCHC) has confirmed that these devices are only used in children with progressive scoliosis who are too young to undergo a full spinal fusion and who need a growing system to help straighten the spine but still allow growth.  When a child receives their MAGEC Rods, they continue to attend a dedicated OLCHC outpatient clinic which ensures monitoring and adjustments to the rods while the child continues to grow.</p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the competent authority for the regulation of medicines and medical devices in Ireland. The Agency has confirmed that it has not received any reported safety incidents from the Irish market in relation to the MAGEC system).  However, the HPRA is aware of concerns raised in relation to this device and is currently conducting a market surveillance review in relation to the product. The outcome of this market surveillance will be communicated when available. </p>  <p>  The HPRA&rsquo;s primary function with regard to the regulation of devices is in post-market surveillance. The HPRA does not maintain a register of devices implanted in people in Ireland. However, orthopaedic surgeons at OLCHC have advocated for the development of a national Spinal Register, and the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has undertaken to progress such a Register and to ensure that it is adequately resourced.  While this is happening, the hospital will continue to monitor patients and audit their ongoing care, documenting any problems that arise.</p>  <p>  The medical device legislation requires that a certain amount of information is made available with the device relating to its intended purpose, and that as far as practicable and appropriate the information needed to use the device safely must be provided with the device on the packaging or by a leaflet setting out use instructions and side-effects.</p>  <p>  New EU Medical Device Regulation will be implemented over the coming years and will enhance and reinforce the existing regulatory system.</p></reply>

I remain concerned about these provisional figures that show a rise in HIV infection.</p><p>The HIV Annual Report for 2017 from the Centre was recently published. It is the latest annual trend data for HIV in Ireland. The report referred to 492 new diagnoses of HIV in Ireland in 2017, a rate of 10.3 per 100,000 population, representing a slight (2%) decrease between 2016 and 2017. </p><p>When those with a previous HIV diagnosis abroad were excluded, the number of new diagnoses decreased by 4% in 2017 compared to 2016.</p><p>The HIV Annual Report for 2017 referred to 223,609 HIV tests carried out in 13 laboratories in Ireland, giving a testing rate of 47.0 per 1,000 population. This compares to 40.5 per 1,000 in 2016 with data being provided by an extra laboratory in 2017.</p><p>HIV testing is available in Ireland through a variety of services, such as opt-out antenatal and sexual health services, emergency departments, NGO&rsquo;s, drug and homeless services and primary care. </p><p>Over the past 2 years, community HIV testing is expanding, in order to reach those most at risk of HIV and identify those living with undiagnosed HIV. The <i>KnowNow </i>community HIV testing model has expanded since the pilot in 2016, and organisations in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway have been funded to provide community HIV testing to populations at higher risk for HIV, such as Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and migrants.</p><p>The HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme have a multi-faceted communications approach in response to the rise in HIV notifications. This includes the development and implementation of national campaigns such as <i>Respectprotect</i>on Twitter for young audiences 18-30 years and the <i>Man2Man</i>(.ie) website for MSM. </p><p>Finally, the website <i>sexualwellbeing</i>(.ie) was launched in April 2018. This website aims to be the trusted source of information on sexual health and wellbeing in Ireland. The website speaks to all people living in Ireland, regardless of their sexual orientation or age/ stage of adult life.</p></reply>

This includes the roll out of increased home support packages to help people to return from hospital to their homes as soon as possible with the supports they need. </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged extensively with the HSE throughout the year to ensure the most effective response to the challenges faced by our hospital system in the provision of unscheduled care this winter.  </p>  <p>  In the first instance, the HSE carried out a review of unscheduled care performance during Winter 2017/18 to assess what worked well and highlight areas for improvement to inform the planning process for the winter ahead.  As part of the review, the HSE convened a joint lessons learned session on 17 April attended by members of the HSE Leadership Team, relevant representation from associated divisions and programmes and officials from my Department. </p>  <p>  The HSE then requested singular integrated winter plans from Hospital Groups and Community Health Organisations in June 2018 and held review meetings with the Hospital Group CEOs and the associated Community Health Care Organisation to formally assess the plans against guidance issued.  </p>  <p>  I subsequently held meetings with Hospital Groups and Community Health Care Organisations to discuss their plans for winter preparedness during September and October. These meetings were attended by officials in my Department and senior management in the HSE. </p>  <p>  Along with officials in my Department, I participated in meetings of the Emergency Department Task Force (EDTF) during the year, which had an ongoing focus on winter planning.  I also attended the EDTF Unscheduled Care Forum on 4 September, which gathered a wide range of stakeholders from the Irish health system to provide perspectives from the frontline on initiatives to improve patient experience and overall system performance. These initiatives informed the winter planning process.</p>  <p>  The EDTF endorsed the Winter Plan on 28 November, which is now in place and covers the period 1 December 2018 to 31 March 2019.  </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to reply to the Deputy directly about their engagement with other bodies in the winter planning process.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the community drugs schemes, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are three indications for the treatment of multiple sclerosis going through the reimbursement process. All had applications made in 2018.</p>  <p>  The NCPE completed a health technology assessment on 29 August 2018 for Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). They recommended that Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments. </p>  <p>  On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed their assessment for Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) indicated for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). They did not recommend that Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) be reimbursed for this indication.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is the statutory decision-making body for medicine reimbursement. It will make the final decision on whether Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) will be reimbursed for each of these indications, taking into consideration the statutory criteria in the 2013 Act.</p>  <p>  The HSE has also commissioned a HTA of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/Cannabidiol, THC/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis (MS) who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy. A full pharmacoeconomic assessment is currently underway by the NCPE. </p>  <p>  The challenge of securing affordable access to innovate medicines is not unique to Ireland.  Over the past two years, I and officials have been engaging with a number of voluntary EU forums including the Roundtable meetings with EU Health Ministers and the pharmaceutical industry, High Level Pharmaceutical Policy Meetings and the Valletta Technical Committee in  an effort to identifying solutions to issues of medicine pricing, sustainability and supply.</p>  <p>  On the 22 June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy to work with Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with  other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for  patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.</p>  <p>  The Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy will have an important role to play in securing faster access to innovative medicines and provide important platforms in which to strengthen the policy mix and deliver on the shared objective of securing access to high cost, innovative treatments at affordable prices. The patient is at the centre of this collaborative international approach.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating. Lyme Disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe. Lyme disease was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  The notifiable entity is the more severe neurological form of Lyme disease: Lyme neuroborreliosis. The best protection against Lyme disease is to prevent tick bites when walking in grassy, bushy or woodland areas, particularly between May and October.  </p><p>Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination. The infection is confirmed by a standard two-staged set of blood tests. A 2016 survey reported that all laboratories offering this testing in Ireland are appropriately accredited and are testing in accordance with best international practice.  Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by medical history and a physical examination which may be carried out by a General Practitioner.  </p><p>Lyme disease may be treated by infectious disease specialists or by general internal medicine available in all acute hospitals.  Medical training programmes at undergraduate or postgraduate level in Ireland provides specialist training in infectious diseases, including Lyme disease. Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics by General Practitioners.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered.  </p><p>The Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland (IDSI) has recently expressed concern that the use of tests that are not validated as clinical diagnostic tests to diagnose Lyme infection can result in the over-diagnosis of Lyme disease and often of other infections.  IDSI is particularly concerned that vulnerable individuals with non-specific, chronic symptoms are being encouraged to access non-accredited diagnostics related to tick-borne infections offered by commercial laboratories overseas, often at considerable personal expense. Use of such unvalidated, exploratory diagnostics can result in public misinformation, undue anxiety to individuals and their families, and unnecessary personal financial burden. Additionally, in the worst cases, there is the potential for misdirected referral, inappropriate treatment and missed opportunities for formal medical assessment to out-rule significant alternative pathology as explanation for the chronic symptoms. These are concerns that I, as Minister, share.</p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have cautioned physicians of the serious risks associated with inappropriate prolonged intravenous antibiotics for what is described as &lsquo;chronic Lyme disease&rsquo;, stating:</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Patients given a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease have been prescribed various treatments for which there is often </i><b><i>no evidence of effectiveness</i></b><i>, including extended courses of antibiotics (lasting months to years)........ At least five randomized, placebo-controlled studies have shown that prolonged courses of IV antibiotics in particular do not substantially improve long-term outcome for patients with a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease and can result in serious harm, including death&rdquo;</i>.</p><p>The IDSI endorses the Infectious Diseases Society of America Treatment Guidelines. It has been argued by various parties that there are two sets of US guidelines for the treatment of Lyme and that it is reasonable for a physician to choose either: those of the IDSA or those of ILADS (International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society). However, an independent review of the ILADS guidelines, instigated by the Chief Executive of the Health Protection Agency, UK and chaired by Professor Brian Duerden CBE, Inspector of Microbiology and Infection Control, Department of Health, England found that they are poorly constructed and do not provide a scientifically sound evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and care of patients with Lyme Borreliosis. This independent review also concluded that:</p><p><i>- &ldquo;There is potential for harm from use of ILADS guidelines. Patients with other serious conditions who receive a misdiagnosis of Lyme through ILADS guideline risk losing opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of their illness.</i></p><p><i>- Patients receiving prolonged antibiotic treatment are at risk of organ damage from adverse effects of the drugs as well as risk of secondary infections such as Clostridium difficile enterocolitis, multi-resistant Gram&ndash;positive or Gram-negative bacterial infections and fungal infections. Patients receiving prolonged treatment with parenteral antibiotics have additional infection-related and other risks associated with long-term intravascular access devices.</i></p><p><i>Other potential harms to patients associated with misdiagnosis include psychological damage through fixation on an unsubstantiated diagnosis of Lyme disease and financial hardship from recommendations and provision of repeated and prolonged courses of oral or parenteral antibiotics&rdquo;.</i></p><p>Given the risks entailed by the models of diagnosis and treatment outlined, and in the absence of robust scientific testing and evidence to demonstrate their efficacy, it would be inappropriate for either the Government or myself as Minister to endorse such methods. Given that appropriate treatment is available in Ireland, it is unnecessary (and, potentially, unsafe) to seek treatment for Lyme disease abroad. </p><p>A Lyme Disease Sub-Committee was established by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). This aims to examine best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to produce a report which identifies the best strategies for the prevention of this disease in Ireland.  The HPSC delayed the publication of its Report in order to incorporate the findings of an extensive systematic review of the evidence on Lyme Disease by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK. This was published earlier this year and the HPSC&rsquo;s own report is now due to be published early in the New Year. In considering the NICE report, the Subcommittee focused solely on the evidence and recommendations contained in the report that related to its remit (specifically in relation to awareness-raising - diagnostics and clinical management aspects fell outside the remit of the Subcommittee). I have been advised that the report of the subcommittee will be recommending the formation of a group of clinicians to review evidence regarding the diagnostics and clinical management of Lyme disease in Ireland as part of its report. </p></reply>

This differs for employees of Section 38 bodies who are directly bound by the Department of Health's Consolidated Salary Scales. It is a matter for Section 39 organisations to negotiate salaries with their staff as part of their employment relationship and within the overall funding available for the delivery of agreed services.

The Review is a multi-year project which is resulting in very significant changes to the way in which services and supports for people with disabilities are delivered in moving away from institutional models of care and service delivery to community based, person centred, models of service. The implementation of the recommendations in the VFM Review continues to be a priority in the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2018.</p><p>The Report &ldquo;<i>Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo; </i>proposes a new model of support in the community moving people from Congregated settings to the community in line with Government policy. </p><p>The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community. The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p><p>At the end of December 2017, there were less than 2,400 people with a disability living in congregated settings. The HSE has prioritised the transition of 170 people from congregated settings in 2018 under its Service Plan. The HSE has established a subgroup, under the Value for Money Steering Group, which is developing an implementation plan for moving people from institutions that will be rolled out at a regional and local level, in full consultation with residents and their families. </p><p>To ensure that the needs of people transitioning from congregated settings are fully taken into account during the process, the model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on <i>&quot;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion&quot;, </i>I have arranged for the specific issues raised in the Deputy's question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Patients in this age group are the highest users of most health and social care services, have more complex needs and longer stays in our Acute Hospitals.</p>  <p>  I recognise that hospitals are increasingly operating at or above capacity, with year-round demand pressures that are further challenged over the winter months. However, the National Service Plan 2018 includes an expected activity target that 100% of patients aged 75 and over are discharged or admitted within 24 hours of registration.  Therefore, any breach of this target in respect of patients in this age cohort is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific question the Deputy has asked, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly.</p></reply>

This reply was taken as a composite with 50929/18, 50930/18 and  50931/18.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health takes the management of patient safety very seriously. In November 2015, the Government approved a major programme of patient safety reforms which  included the establishment of a National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) in the Department of Health. The NPSO was established in December 2016 to oversee a programme of patient safety measures. The programme of patient safety centres on initiatives such as the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the introduction of a patient safety surveillance system, the measurement of patient experience and extending the clinical effectiveness agenda.</p>  <p>  The NPSO is also progressing a programme of legislation in relation to the provision of open disclosure of patient safety incidents, the Patient Safety Bill, which will provide for the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events, and a Patient Safety Licensing Bill, which will introduce a regulatory regime for all hospitals as well as certain designated high risk activities.</p>  <p>  In addition, on 25 October 2017, I launched the National Standards on the Conduct of Reviews of Patient Safety Incidents. These standards, developed jointly by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission, set out a new approach to the way health providers respond to, review and investigate incidents in order to determine as quickly as possible what may have transpired, and why, to ensure that they can immediately implement any improvements necessary to prevent a re-occurrence.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Health Service Executive (HSE) finalised the review of its Safety incident management Policy and launched its new Incident Management Frameworks in January which will support implementation.</p></reply>

In effect, everyone pays the same amount of money for the same level of health insurance coverage, regardless of their age or health status. </p>  <p>  Risk equalisation is essential to underpin community rating, as without it insurers with older and sicker customers would be forced to charge higher premiums.  It is important to note that risk equalisation is Exchequer neutral: stamp duty is charged on each health insurance contract and redistributed to insurers based on their risk profile.</p>  <p>  The voluntary private health insurance market in Ireland is proportionately one of the largest in the world.  Given the fact that over 45% of Irish people hold health insurance, it is appropriate that our health insurance system is community-rated and is supported by risk equalisation.  There is long-standing and cross-party political support for community rating, which is reflected and reaffirmed in the Oireachtas each year during the passage of the Health Insurance Bill. </p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report anticipates that implementation of its reform programme will have an impact on the demand for private health insurance in Ireland, as enhancements and changes are made to the public health system.  There is close and robust regulation of the health insurance market on an ongoing basis.  In the coming years, we will continue to ensure that the regulatory regime in place is appropriate to the size of the market and to the role played by private health insurance within the healthcare system.</p></reply>

Hospitals working together in a group can support each other, providing a stronger role for smaller hospitals in delivering less complex care, and ensuring that those who require emergency or complex planned care are managed safely in larger hospitals.</p>  <p>  The RCSI Hospital Group, which includes both Cavan General Hospital and Monaghan Hospital, has identified the need for development of the resuscitation area in Cavan Emergency Department.  Future investment in Cavan General Hospital will be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme, the prioritised needs of the hospital groups and within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.</p>  <p>  With regard to Monaghan Hospital, the Smaller Hospitals Framework focuses in particular on the future role of smaller hospitals and outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within these smaller hospitals.  As a Model 2 hospital, in line with the Smaller Hospitals Framework, Monaghan Hospital has a Minor Injuries Unit located on site which provides an important service to the local community.  I recently met with the RCSI Hospital Group to discuss how all hospitals within the group can develop and contribute to improvements in both scheduled and unscheduled care for patients.</p>  <p>  I am committed to securing and further developing the role of our smaller hospitals with the expansion of services delivered in these hospitals, especially in services such as day surgery; ambulatory care; medical services and diagnostics.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan provides &euro;10.9 billion for Health capital developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects, across acute, primary and social care.  Health capital projects and programmes currently underway will continue.

On top of the pay increases provided under the PSSA, in September agreement was reached with staff interests on proposals relating to the so-called &ldquo;new entrant pay&rdquo; issue.  This would deliver an average of an additional &euro;3,000 over the coming years starting in March next year to over 60,000 post-2011 new entrants, including 10,000 nurses.</p><p>  In addition, the Public Service Pay Commission recommended a 20% increase in the Location and Qualification Allowances for nurses and midwives and accelerated promotion for nurses to the senior staff nurse level.  Subject to acceptance, these measures will be implemented from March 2019 at a cost of &euro;20m per annum.</p><p>Both the INMO and the PNA have rejected the pay proposals.  However, the pursuit of cost increasing pay claims and engagement in industrial action are both specifically excluded under the terms of the Public Service Pay and Stability Agreement (PSSA 2018 - 2020) - a collective agreement which the INMO and its members currently subscribe to.  Concession of any such pay claim, which has been costed at up to &euro;300m p.a. would compromise public pay and budgetary policy and would also generate follow on claims from the rest of the public service workforce.  </p><p>It should also be noted that there are no 'pay negotiations' underway with nursing staff, as suggested by the Deputy.  However, notwithstanding their rejection of these proposals, officials from my Department and the HSE have met with the nursing unions to clarify their issues.  I understand that the parties have been invited to attend the National Oversight Body and I am hopeful this will help to progress matters.</p></reply>

That particular winter, there was a series of extreme wind events coupled with water-logged soils, which resulted in the loss of some six million trees.  The Reconstitution Scheme opened in 2017 and payments have now been finalised.  I do not intend to reopen this scheme.</p>  <p>  There is an obligation on all land owners with forestry, whether grant-aided or not, to replant where forestry is felled during normal tree felling operations or following damage by adverse weather.  Indeed, following wind blow, felled or partially felled trees will be dangerous and it is imperative that a forester or a person experienced in dealing with blown trees fells and removes timber to minimise any danger to other trees, people and property.</p>  <p>  It is efficient to manage normal thinning and tree felling operations over time in order to spread both the income from the felled timber and the replanting costs evenly.  The proceeds from clear-fell are more than sufficient to cover the costs of replanting while still providing profit which of course is tax-free to the beneficiary.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the State&rsquo;s main grant-aid schemes is to promote forestry by providing initial start-up incentives.  These schemes were not developed to provide indefinite assistance to land owners within a viable industry.  Hence, replanting operations do not attract subsidies under the schemes as it is considered that the land owner is well-placed to sustain their investment.</p></reply>

My Department contributed &euro;25 million in total, which included &euro;11.1 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers&rsquo; under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1613 and &euro;14 million in national funding. The SBCI used the &euro;25 million to leverage the Scheme, funding an interest subsidy and guaranteeing first losses.</p><p>SBCI did not provide funding but, along with the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs, administered by the European Investment Fund), provided the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.  The loans were distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank. </p><p>The delivery the ACSLS has acted as a catalyst to encourage financial institutions to improve and develop new loan products for the sector.  A recently announced initiative by one of the main banks mirrors that Scheme in offering a discounted interest rate with extended and flexible repayment terms. The &lsquo;Milk Flex&rsquo; loan product developed by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, with dairy co-op and private banking participation, is another good example of innovation in this regard.</p><p>In addition, many farmers rely heavily on co-op and merchant credit and I have welcomed initiatives by some of the co-ops in relation to credit facilities for their suppliers.</p><p>In relation to the other loan schemes in which my Department is involved:</p><p>- The Brexit Loan Scheme, launched in March 2018, provides affordable, flexible working capital to Brexit-impacted businesses, including food businesses,</p><p>- The Future Growth Loan Scheme, expected to launch early in 2019, will make competitively priced, long-term investment loans available to eligible Irish businesses, including the primary agriculture, agri-food &amp;amp; seafood sectors. </p><p>Each loan scheme is bespoke and it is not possible to estimate the cost of a scheme until it is under development. </p><p>In addition to funding sources, compliance with EU State Aid provisions is another key factor in developing any loan scheme.  For example, in the case of the ACSLS, the use of EU exceptional aid funding  for the scheme meant that loans to livestock farmers were State Aid free, whereas loans to the non-livestock sector were operated under de minimis State Aid limits for primary agriculture. </p></reply>

To date my Department had been identifying eligible areas using a range of socio economic indicators such as family farm income, population density, percentage of working population engaged in agriculture, and stocking density. </p><p>From 2019, eligible areas must instead be designated using the following list of bio-physical criteria:</p><p>- Low  temperature</p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope</p><p>This process has now been completed and in recent weeks I have published details in relation to the outcome and have completed a series of consultation meetings with key stakeholders.  </p><p>The outcome of the review project can be summarised as follows: The vast majority of land that was eligible under the existing Scheme will remain eligible under the new approach.  Some 700 townlands that would have previously been eligible are not eligible  under the new designation.  Farmers impacted financially by this  change will receive a degressive phasing out payment in 2019 and  2020.  Over 2,000 townlands will now be eligible under the new approach and will be eligible to receive a payment for the first time in 2019.</p><p>The townland in question has not met the thresholds set out in the EU Regulations in relation to the above bio-physical criteria.  In such cases, it is also possible for townlands to be deemed eligible as &quot;areas of specific constraint&quot;.  In Ireland's case, we have agreed an approach with the EU Commission to identifying such areas by reference to criteria pertaining to areas of specific environmental importance, townlands facing structural issues relating to farm size and farm fragmentation, and townlands facing constraints relating to the level of permanent grassland cover and field size.  The townland in question did not, however, satisfy any of the thresholds in this regard.</p><p>In many cases where townlands are not eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme, there may be no direct financial impact on a farmer's 2019 scheme payment.  For example, this will be the case where a farmer still holds enough eligible land in other townlands to draw down a full payment under the Scheme.  This is the case in this instance.</p><p>For any farmer who wishes to appeal the status of a particular townland in the 2019 ANC scheme, an independently chaired appeals process is available.  Should a farmer wish to make such an appeal,  my Department will provide full information in relation to the data underpinning the status of the townland in order that an appeal can be based on full information.  My Department is currently writing to impacted farmers and this letter includes a form to instigate an appeal.  The appeals form is also available on www.agriculture.gov.ie. </p></reply>

This however depends on the detail of any final Brexit agreement between the EU and the UK. It should be noted that stocks held outside Ireland  are not impacted by Brexit in  terms of Ireland's IEA obligations.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across Ireland; and a State intervention in those areas, mostly rural areas, where commercial companies are unlikely to invest. </p>  <p>  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of all 2.3 million Irish premises had access to high speed broadband.  Today, 74% of premises can access high speed broadband. </p>  <p>  In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/Eircode:</p>  <p>  - The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p>  <p>  - The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p>  <p>  - The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017. </p>  <p>   According to data for Q3 2018 submitted by eir to my Department the company has passed almost 210,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment to 300,000 premises. Further detail on this progress is provided on its website www.fibrerollout.ie. </p>  <p>  My priority is bringing the procurement process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible.  My Department is concluding its assessment of the final tender submission received from the bidder on 18 September 2018 and I will bring a recommendation to Government in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements.</p></reply>

The Schemes have in-built deadlines designed to incentivise projects to become operational and maximise their contribution to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 renewable energy targets, in accordance with the methodology set out in the Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC).   </p>  <p>  A number of extensions to both the REFIT 2 and REFIT 3 deadlines have already been granted in recent years, in particular to facilitate significant volumes of projects that were facing technology specific delays in the planning and connection processes and meeting the financing timeframes originally set out in the REFIT terms and conditions.  The Department is working closely with ESB Networks, EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to ensure that renewable electricity projects are connected as soon as possible to the electricity grid and that the current deadlines are met in order to maximise their contribution to the 2020 target.  </p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the policy focus is moving to a competitive framework for the support of renewable electricity projects, which are anchored in robust community engagement as set out in the high level design of the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS).  The RESS high level design was approved by Government in July 2018 and it is expected that the first renewable electricity auctions will take place in 2019.  The RESS has been designed to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards an EU-wide renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030, within a competitive, auction-based, cost effective framework and underpinned by strong community participation requirements. </p>  <p>  The role of government is not to crowd out private sector investment through extending subsidy schemes.  Corporate contracting of renewable energy is becoming an increasing feature of the global energy transformation, harnessing the capital that large demand users can bring to bear on the sector and driving down consumer costs.  I would like to see corporate power purchase agreements start to take off in Ireland, contributing to our 2020 and 2030 renewable targets and delivering value for money to consumers. </p>  <p>  A request for a grace period under the REFIT 2 scheme is currently being examined by my officials, taking into account the available evidence and impacts and the issues I have outlined above, and will then be submitted to me for decision.</p></reply>

The Sport Ireland subhead and the Sports Capital Programme subhead are partly funded from the proceeds of the National Lottery.  These programmes are only part-funded by the National Lottery with the remaining expenditure coming from general Exchequer funding.  The Revised Estimates do not specify the precise amount of National Lottery funding in each individual subhead.  Accordingly, it is not possible to say how much of the funding provided to the organisation mentioned by the Deputy relates to proceeds of the National Lottery. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland is the statutory body with responsibility for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport, including responsibility for the allocation of current expenditure funding to the organisation referred to by the Deputy.  In addition to current funding, Exchequer capital funding of &euro;500,000 was provided through Sport Ireland during the period mentioned under a Partnership Agreement between Sport Ireland and the organisation, to facilitate works relating to the development of pitches for the relevant sport at the National Sports Campus in Abbotstown.  </p>  <p>  I have referred the Deputy's question to Sport Ireland for direct reply in relation to the allocation of funding to the organisation mentioned in each of the years 2008 to 2018, and the way in which the funding is audited.  I would ask the Deputy to inform my office if a reply is not received within 10 days.</p>  <p>  In relation to assistance for capital projects, the Sports Capital Programme (SCP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.  From 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017 grants totalling &euro;1,694,000 have been allocated directly to the organisation referred to by the Deputy.  No amounts were allocated in 2018.  Separately, numerous individual clubs and other units at county and provincial levels which are affiliated to the organisation referred to by the Deputy have received SCP funding over the years.  Details of all allocations to all clubs and organisations under the SCP since 1998 are published on the Department's website at www.dttas.ie/sport/english/sports-capital-programme.  Spot-checks in relation to the Sports Capital Programme (SCP) are carried out in accordance with the relevant Department of Finance Guidelines and are carried out by the Finance Unit of my Department.  Checks are undertaken in respect of payments made in the previous year.  The checks are primarily designed to ensure that the work undertaken by grantees is consistent with that indicated in the grant award, ensure that payments were paid correctly and in a timely manner, and that appropriate insurance is in place for grant aided facilities.  The inspections are also used to obtain feedback from grantees on the Sports Capital Programme.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.</p>  <p>  Prior to the financial crisis, applications for funding for projects such as the Edenderry Inner Relief Road would have been considered as part of the Specific Improvement Grant Scheme for regional and local roads.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant this grant scheme had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The NDP does provide for the gradual build-up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.  For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific Grant Programme.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific Grant Programme are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  </p>  <p>  As required under the capital project appraisal process Offaly County Council has submitted a Preliminary Appraisal in relation to the Inner Relief Road.  Once that appraisal is assessed, taking into account other competing projects and the overall roads budget, my Department will respond to Offaly County Council.</p></reply>

The report was published in late October and provides a very helpful assessment which is both specific about short terms actions as well as identifying further work needed to assist in decision-making regarding the provision of infrastructure at the airports for the longer term to 2050.  </p>  <p>  The Review took into account the policy objectives of supporting the roles of Cork as well as Shannon Airports as key tourism and business gateways for their regions, along with the development of Dublin as a secondary hub.  This is in line with the National Aviation Policy which recognises the roles that both Cork and Shannon play in the regions.</p>  <p>  To ensure that there is an open approach to policy-making, I have commenced a process of consultation on the Review in which all stakeholders will have an opportunity to set out their views.  When I have all the views and information available to me, I will consider the issues and make recommendations to Government in early 2019. </p>  <p>  While I have responsibility for overarching national airports policy, the specific plans for the long term growth and development of Cork Airport, including details of investment plans, are a matter for Cork Airport management working with daa which has statutory responsibility to operate, manage and develop both Dublin and Cork airports.  On that basis, to be of assistance, I have referred your question to daa for their attention and for direct reply.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy does not receive a reply within ten working days, please advise my Private Office.</p></reply>

It was established under the framework of the Good Friday Agreement, and is jointly funded by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  At the recent launch of its 2019 Market Plans, Tourism Ireland set out its targets for 2019.  Next year, it aims to grow overseas tourism revenue by +6% to &euro;6.5 billion for the island of Ireland and to grow visitor numbers to 11.67 million (+4%). </p>  <p>  Whilst it does not set regional targets, Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for 2019 is to focus on regional and seasonal growth.  Its new global campaign, &lsquo;Fill Your Heart with Ireland&rsquo;, will place a greater focus on driving growth to less visited attractions and locations, as well as on driving business in the off-peak and shoulder seasons.</p></reply>

I, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, do not have any function in these commercial decisions.  </p>  <p>  In addition to incentive schemes offered directly by airports, the Government already supports the development of air connectivity through funding for cooperative marketing activity.  Cooperative campaigns with partners facilitate increased marketing effort and help promote the destination more widely.  They assist in driving demand for new and existing inbound air and sea services and leverage commercial investment in marketing Irish tourism, thereby sustaining the island&rsquo;s vital route network.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;1 million was made available to Tourism Ireland annually in 2016, 2017 and 2018 for cooperative marketing.  This funding, supported by contributions from regional tourism stakeholders (airports and ports) was matched by air and sea carriers and resulted in total overseas marketing expenditure of &euro;2.6m in 2016 and &euro;2.4m in 2017.  The funds were used to encourage new access and maximise the potential of existing services to the regions, thus optimising Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East, Wild Atlantic Way and more recently Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands&rsquo; initiatives.</p>  <p>  Supporting both seasonal and regional growth, with an increased budget, will again be the focus for Tourism Ireland in 2019, with the aim of increasing visitor numbers in the shoulder season.  This will be underscored by a commitment to focus co-operative partnership activities on the January-April and October-December periods for Great Britain and the North American and European markets.</p>  <p>  The Government's Regional Airports Programme also provides Exchequer support to some of Ireland&rsquo;s smallest airports, namely Donegal, Ireland West Airport Knock, Kerry and Waterford through a number of schemes in compliance with EU Guidelines on State Aid.  Passenger numbers at these airports are less than 1 million per year and the capital supports under the Programme are limited to grant-aiding investments in safety and security enhancements, thus helping these small airports to comply with international regulatory obligations in these areas.</p>  <p>  In light of the foregoing, I have no plans to introduce any additional funding measures along the lines referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.</p>  <p>  Prior to the financial crisis, applications for funding for road improvement projects would have been considered as part of the Specific Improvement, and Strategic Regional and Local Road Grant Schemes.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.</p>  <p>  The NDP does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network.  For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes.</p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.</p>  <p>  Under the capital project appraisal process a Preliminary Appraisal has to be submitted in relation to each proposed project.  Once an appraisal is received it is assessed taking into account other competing projects and the overall roads budget.  The Department's Engineering Inspectors liaise on a regular basis with local authorities regarding their regional and road network.  To date no application has been received by my Department from Meath County Council  in relation to a bypass of Julianstown.</p></reply>

As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have no function in these commercial decisions.  However, there are on-going consultations between my Department, other Government Departments and agencies, and public and private aviation stakeholders in order to continue to plan for and mitigate the risks associated with Brexit.  It is also important that the aviation industry, including airports, takes steps to prepare and where possible to reduce their exposure and to limit reliance on any one particular destination or service.</p>  <p>  The Government has been clear that its approach to preparing for Brexit is aimed at minimising the impact it could have on our trade, our economy and seeking an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU. </p>  <p>  The full implications of Brexit will only become clear once the future EU-UK relationship has been decided.  However, the Draft Political Declaration setting out the Framework for the Future Relationship between the EU and the UK published recently foresees a comprehensive partnership between the EU and the UK, including across a range of areas of importance to Ireland, including air transport.  The European Commission&rsquo;s Contingency Plan, published on 13 November, outlines plans to propose measures to ensure that disruption to air travel between the UK and the EU will be minimised in the event of a disorderly UK exit from the EU, subject to reciprocity.</p>  <p>  Government also supports the development of air connectivity and the expansion of air services more generally through funding for cooperative marketing activity.  Cooperative campaigns with partners facilitate increased marketing effort and help promote the destination more widely.  Funding of &euro;1 million was made available to Tourism Ireland annually in 2016, 2017 and 2018 for cooperative marketing.  This funding, supported by contributions from regional tourism stakeholders (Airports and Ports) was matched by air and sea carriers and resulted in total overseas marketing expenditure of &euro;2.6 million in 2016 and &euro;2.4 million in 2017.</p>  <p>  An increased budget allocation for 2019 will continue to support both seasonal and regional growth and will be underscored by a commitment to focus co-operative partnership activities on the January-April and October-December periods for Great Britain and the North American and European markets.  I would encourage all airports to avail of this funding to optimise air services, including Shannon Airport with regard to alternative European hub connections.</p></reply>

There were three expressions of interest received for new pools, two of which were valid and both in Dublin.  Having assessed existing commitments and the funding available, it was decided to include the proposal from South Dublin County Council (SDCC) for a new swimming pool in Lucan in the LASPP.</p>  <p>  My Department wrote to SDCC in April 2016 advising the Council to undertake the Preliminary Report stage (which includes the Feasibility Study, Appointment of Consultants for Preliminary Proposals and Design Brief).  Documentation in this regard was received from SDCC in July 2016.  Following examination by my Department's technical advisor and my officials, SDCC was given approval in October 2016 to appoint the recommended design team and proceed to the design brief.  In April 2017, the detailed drawings were received by my Department and referred to my Department's technical advisor for consideration.  Following clarification of some technical queries, my Department issued approval to the technical design element of the Preliminary Report on 5 July 2017.  This approval allowed the Council to have the detailed contract documents prepared and allowed SDCC to proceed to the Part 8 planning process.</p>  <p>  The contract documents, which were finalised by SDCC in August 2018, are currently being examined by my Department's technical advisor and in this regard, my officials continue to liaise with the Council.  Once finalised I understand that SDCC will be in a position to submit the tender report to my Department shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

The upper age ECCE requirement is that the child must not reach 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year. </p>  <p>  This new measure will address the previous situation with regard to multiple entry points whereby there was a broad fluctuation in the number of free preschool weeks a child could avail of &ndash;(between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child)&ndash; and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children. The situation where there was more than one entry point created a perception of inequality to some parents when they considered the variance in the number of weeks of ECCE provision, dependant on their entry point. </p>  <p>  The number of entry points reverted to one at the beginning of September 2018. One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help to streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. It also makes it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.</p>  <p>  Some children will not be able to commence their ECCE in September of the programme year as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August. However, they will be able to commence ECCE in the following September and continue for a further year from September of the next programme year. Parents of children born around this time of the year may prefer for their children to start school at age 4 rather than 5 years. These parents may therefore choose to avail of 1 year of ECCE only. However, it is important to note that this is a parental choice and that the overall policy change has ensured that two programme years are available to all children.</p></reply>

This involves working closely with very vulnerable and marginalised young people. There are challenges with recruitment and retention in the area of special care, that are not unique to this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>   I am aware that a national recruitment campaign for social care workers was organised by Tusla in 2017 which provided an extensive recruitment panel and talent pool from which newly funded and vacant positions were filled.  I am also aware that due to the challenges in filling posts in the special care area, Tusla has employed agency workers, as a temporary measure, to ensure continuity of care. </p>  <p>   Tusla has been engaged in a programme to enhance the capacity and quality of care and therapeutic supports in its special care units.  Tusla is also developing bespoke recruitment initiatives for social care workers to meet the particular needs of special care. Tusla aims to have a maximum capacity of 26 places across 3 mixed gender units following the registration of special care units with Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) under the new regulations.  </p>  <p>   In addition to this, my Department provided capital funding to Tusla in 2016 and 2017 for the refurbishment and development of two special care units in the Dublin area. Due to the necessity of completing these works, one unit was not operational and one unit remained partially open at this time.</p></reply>

Objective 8 within this goal relates to 'Affordable, high-quality Early Learning and Care' and contains the following two actions:</p>  <p>  - Introduce measures to ensure that children in Gaeltacht areas have access to Irish-medium ELC provision (Strategic Action 8.2; page 145).</p>  <p>  - Develop mechanisms to provide Irish-language supports to ELC provision where there are high proportions of children who are learning through the medium of Irish (Strategic Action 8.3; page 147).</p>  <p>  The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will lead on the delivery of the first action outlined above, as it relates to children in Gaeltacht areas.  My Department will lead on the delivery of the second action, which very much links in with our commitments under the Irish Language Action Plan 2018-2022 to improve supports and services in the area of Irish-medium early years education.  </p>  <p>  As you are aware, one of the commitments contained within the Irish Language action plan relates to the creation of two Irish language early years posts to further the development of Irish language provision in the early years sector in non-Gaeltacht areas.  This will include the development of a comprehensive plan for this sector.  This plan will be developed through engagement with the relevant stakeholders within the sector, both within and outside the Gaeltacht.  There are no plans at present to publish this plan, however it will be utilised to inform the way in which we can effectively build on existing supports, and identify and develop new initiatives, to advance the overall implementation of the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language.  As outlined in Parliamentary Question No. 528 of 27 November 2018, a national oversight group will oversee the implementation of this plan and the actions contained within the five year action plan as they relate to the early years sector.</p></reply>

This is a 27 per cent (&euro;62 million) increase on 2018 and reflects the scale of the Government's ambition and policy commitments to continue to support a diverse range of initiatives aimed at strengthening rural economies and communities.</p><p>Budget 2019 sees the beginning of the process of investment under the &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF).  This provides unprecedented opportunities to support the revitalisation of rural Ireland.  Importantly, the first projects to be supported under the Fund will begin in 2019 and an allocation of &euro;55 million has been made available for this purpose. I announced the first round of category 1 RRDF funding allocations on 23 November 2018 and will make further announcements early in 2019.</p><p>Additional funding of &euro;3.3million was secured for Library Development, bringing the total to &euro;7.2million for 2019, while funding for the Walks Programme will double to &euro;4million. An extra &euro;2.4million of supports will be provided for measures under the Dormant Accounts Action Plan.</p><p>I also welcome the increased funding provided for communities in the West and in border areas through the Western Development Commission and the PEACE Programme respectively. </p><p>The Revised Estimates will be published in December and will set out the definitive allocations for the coming year. </p><p>I am very pleased that increased investment to support rural and community development throughout this country is at the heart of the Government&rsquo;s plans in 2019. The significant increase in funding outlined in the Budget reflects the commitment to advancing economic and social progress in rural Ireland and to the development of vibrant and sustainable communities across Ireland.</p></reply>

They are not employees of my Department or public servants.  My Department funds wages and training costs in respect of CE participants and supervisors &ndash; it does not and has not provided provision for funding for CE supervisor pensions.</p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the issue of CE supervisor pensions is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A number of Departments, including my own Department, are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.</p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious that any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources. </p></reply>

However, if the payments constitute employment or self-employment, then the disregards above would apply.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the means assessment of social assistance schemes would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

The facility allows participants to have regular amounts deducted from their social welfare payments which then go towards paying various household bills or rents or to repay certain loans to credit unions.</p>  <p>  Social welfare recipients wishing to avail of the Household Budget Service apply to An Post to use the facility.  Deductions are managed by An Post and are forwarded to the appropriate utility companies, local authorities/housing bodies or credit unions at no cost to the customer or to my Department.</p>  <p>  For payments made to customers on Friday 2 and Wednesday 7 November, there was a technical issue with the payment files sent from the Department to An Post.  Consequently An Post were unable to apply the automatic household budget deduction for some Social Welfare recipients.

There has been no reoccurrence of the problem.</p>  <p>  Customers whose Household Budget Service deductions were not applied did not incur any loss to their social welfare payments.  However, they would need to make alternative arrangements with the relevant utility companies, local authorities / housing bodies and credit unions for repayment towards household bills for the week that the deductions were not made.</p>  <p>  My Department wrote directly to every individual affected by this technical issue apologising for the inconvenience caused to them and also to ensure that everyone affected was aware that the weekly deduction had not been made so that they could make any necessary arrangements.</p>  <p>  I regret the inconvenience caused to the social welfare recipients affected by this technical failure.</p></reply>

They are not employees of my Department or public servants.  My Department funds wages and training costs in respect of CE participants and supervisors &ndash; it does not provide and has not provided for funding for CE supervisor pensions.</p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the issue of CE supervisor pensions is currently being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A number of Departments, including my own Department, are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.</p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State-funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.</p></reply>

Private sector companies/organisations employ people who happen to have a disability, and these employees enjoy the same employment rights, protections, terms and conditions of employment and any other benefits of their employment as would any other employee of a particular company.</p><p>The scheme transferred from the former F&Aacute;S agency to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) in 2012 and its operational guidelines were reviewed in 2016 by the Department and in subsequent years.  The guidelines are published on the Department's website.  A detailed description of the WSS and the different payment strands is available on welfare.ie, specifically .</p><p>Expenditure on the Wage Subsidy Scheme from 2012 to 2018 is shown in Table 1.</p><p><b>Table 1</b>: Expenditure on the Wage Subsidy Scheme<table><tr><th>Year</th><th><div>Wage Subsidy Scheme (including ESS) &euro;million</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>2012</div></td><td><div>&euro;10.57</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2013</div></td><td><div>&euro;11.04</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2014</div></td><td><div>&euro;12.59</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2015</div></td><td><div>&euro;16.39</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2016</div></td><td><div>&euro;19.40</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2017</div></td><td><div>&euro;20.83</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>2018</div></td><td><div>&euro;18.55 (to October)</div></td></tr></table></p><p>In 2012, there were 663 employers availing of the scheme. At end October 2018, there were 1,663 in receipt of strand 1 subsidies with 137 of these in receipt of Strand 2 and three in receipt of Strand 3.  Each of these payments is in effect a strand one payment.

During a desk or on site monitoring visit the case officer can seek copies of various supporting documentation including tax, wage or time and attendance records to check that the terms and conditions of the subsidy are being adhered to.</p><p>The Department does not currently collect data centrally on the number of these inspections or on the number of employers that have been disqualified.  Information will be collated and sent to the Deputy.  It is expected that the move to the improved IT infrastructure in 2019 will improve the ability centrally to report on the scheme.</p><p>A review of the EmployAbility Service by Indecon was published in 2016.  The Department intends to undertake a review of the Reasonable Accommodation Fund in 2019 with a view to assessing how its operations could be more effective.</p></reply>

The purpose of the training is to deliver clear and accurate information about disability and to address questions or concerns that employers and employees may have about working with people with disabilities.  Further details on the grants / schemes are available on the department&rsquo;s website (see link below) including the Employer information pack, which sets out details of the supports available for employers.</p><p>The Reasonable Accommodation Fund (RAF) and the DASS are demand-led schemes where expenditure arises in response to applications received.

The aim of the programme is to promote employment prospects and meaningful social roles for young people with disabilities and in particular, young people who are distant from the labour market, through engagement in training and personal development activities, which would be followed by an incremental exposure to work.</p>  <p>  Pobal have been contracted by DEASP to manage the programme and it is being delivered by 27 community and voluntary groups from around the country.  The projects being funded have been designed to assist young people in their transition from school to further education and employment. This will be undertaken using person-centred, case management approaches that support participants to achieve their desired employment goals.  </p>  <p>  The funding for this programme amounts to around &euro;16 million over a three year period and is being provided jointly under the EUs ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) Operational Programme, 2014-2020 (PEIL, 2014&ndash;20) and the Irish Exchequer.  &euro;4,499,259 has been spent to date.  This includes a service fee to Pobal for the development of the programme including IT development from the initial call for applications in late 2017 and for the  on-going management of the Programme.  It also includes the initial drawdown of funding by the 27 successful organisations in order for them to carry out the work.  </p>  <p>  It is expected that the programme will support over 2,600 young people with disabilities aged between 15 and 29 years of age over the course of the programme.  The projects have only recently commenced delivering their services and recruitment of participants on the Ability programme is now underway. The Department will have accurate figures on the number of young people who have engaged with the programme in late December when the projects have submitted their progress reports to Pobal on the work to date.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The work primarily consists of a determination of the status of Ireland&rsquo;s marine waters, the measures necessary to achieve, or maintain, the required Good Environmental Status by 2020 and a programme to monitor this.  The preparation of a draft Initial Assessment (under Art. 8 of the MSFD) including proposals for Good Environmental Status (Art. 9) and for draft Environmental Targets (Art.10) is underpinned by a suite of monitoring measures to measure the maritime environment against these targets (Art. 11). Where human activities are preventing these targets from being met, a Programme of Measures to mitigate the effect of these activities, or halt them as appropriate (Art.13) has been finalised.  <br /><br />(3)This report was co-funded by my Department and the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  The cost to my Department of &euro;42,706 represents 50% of the total cost.<br /><br />(4)The contracting authority for this report was Kildare County Council and the costs were recouped by my Department.<br /><br />(5)The four members of the panel provided their services on a pro-bono basis. The costs associated with the preparation of the report related to travel and subsistence (at Civil Service rates).<br /><br />(6)This report is being co-funded by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</blockquote></p></reply>

The standardised protocol will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all affected householders. </p><p>The standardised protocol was published by the NSAI on 13 November 2018.</p><p><i>&lsquo;I.S. 465:2018 - Assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials&rsquo;</i>, is available at .</p><p>The standard can be used to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite. Previously, there was no common way for engineers or homeowners to assess the damage caused by defective concrete blocks to help decide what, if any, remedial work could be carried out.</p><p>This standard:</p><p>1. establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing certain excessive amounts of deleterious materials (free or unbound muscovite mica, or aggregate with potentially deleterious quantities of pyrite);</p><p>2. describes methods for establishing the extent of the problem; </p><p>3. describes the scope of any testing required; and</p><p>4. categorises buildings, in accordance with this Standard, providing competent persons with guidance on the appropriate measures to be taken.</p><p>With regard to Recommendation 2, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland in relation to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for homeowners/affected parties&rsquo; reference. Engineers Ireland has provided assurance that they are in the process of finalising measures to establish such a register now that the standardised protocol is in place.</p><p>Last year, I visited Donegal and Mayo and met with key stakeholders, including affected homeowners, elected members and officials of the local authorities and other interested parties. I made similar visits to both counties this year and I will continue to monitor the situation and to update affected parties on progress. </p><p>Under Budget 2019, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.</p><p>The putting in place of such a scheme is now a key priority for my Department and work is well underway on the development of such a scheme, including discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to funding.  It is intended to revert to Government with proposals for the scheme shortly with a view to publishing details of the scheme as soon as possible thereafter.</p></reply>

The grant, subject to certain conditions, assists households dependent on these supplies with the costs incurred in providing such a supply of water for domestic purposes or rectifying serious deficiencies in either quantity or quality of an existing supply.</p>  <p>  It is the practice of the local authorities that administer the grant on behalf of my Department to take, or request samples of the water supply to be taken, before and after the installation of equipment under the grant scheme. These samples must then be tested in an accredited laboratory. The cost of this testing is recoverable under the grant scheme.</p>  <p>  In April 2018, I established a Working Group to conduct a review of the wider investment needs relating to rural water services. The Group's aim is to recommend measures to provide for an equality in outcomes between those who receive water services from Irish Water and non-Irish water customers.  </p>  <p>  The terms of reference of the review provide for a two-strand approach.

The Scheme enables local authorities to provide home loans in accordance with the criteria set out in the Regulations and the Statutory Credit Policy. The Housing Agency has been tasked with carrying out assessments of loan applications on behalf of local authorities and making recommendations in respect of each application</p>  <p>  Under the Regulations it is a matter for each local authority to make the decision on loan approval applications. Under the Statutory Credit Policy each authority must establish a Credit Committee to consider these applications on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the Statutory Credit Policy and  having regard to the recommendations of the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  The Statutory Credit Policy also obliges local authorities to establish an appeals process under which applicants, who are dissatisfied with a decision of a Credit Committee, may appeal that decision.  Details of the appeals process can be obtained from the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the local authority's appeals process, if a loan applicant remains dissatisfied with the outcome and considers that they have been treated unfairly, then they can request that the Office of the Ombudsman examines the case. The Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies, and local authority house loans are among the areas that they are permitted to examine.</p></reply>

The presence of such a right of way could also impair the purchaser's ability to resell the property and could subsequently adversely affect the value of the asset.</p>  <p>  In relation to self-build applications, the statutory Credit Policy states that the applicant's solicitor must confirm that there are no easements, way leaves or rights of way in favour of or over subject property and that the site must have access to the public road over land in the applicant's boundaries. </p>  <p>  As the final decision on whether to approve or issue a loan rests with the relevant local authority's Credit Committee, they must be satisfied that appropriate legal documentation has been provided in order to protect the future value of the asset for both the borrower and the State.</p></reply>

The setting of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and, as such, is a matter for the elected members.</p><p>Detail in relation to HAP transfers by local authority is set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>LA Name</th><th>Grand Total</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow County Council</td><td>54</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan County Council</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td>151</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Council</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County Council</td><td>199</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council</td><td>187</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown Co Co</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny County Council</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Laois County Council</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim County Council</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>134</td></tr><tr><td>Longford County Council</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Louth County Council</td><td>132</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo County Council</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>122</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon County Council</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo County Council</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council</td><td>112</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; Co Co</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath County Council</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford County Council</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow County Council</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>1,765</td></tr></table></p><p>A breakdown of transfers by year has been requested from the Shared Service Centre and, if it can be provided, it will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible. </p><p>HAP was rolled out in 4 waves between September 2014 and March 2017 - the nationwide roll-out of the scheme was completed with its introduction, on 1 March 2017, to the administrative areas of Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council. </p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of the HAP scheme under review.

Proposals under consideration by the Working Group have been aimed at facilitating short-term letting of accommodation within permanent residences, known as homesharing, while protecting the existing stock of residential property in areas of high demand.</p>  <p>  Having considered the Working Group's report as well as the recommendations in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on short-term lettings, I recently announced plans to introduce a &ldquo;one host, one home&rdquo; model in areas where there is high housing demand. </p>  <p>  Homesharing will continue to be permissible for a person&rsquo;s primary residence, and such home-sharers will now have to register with their local authority. In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.  I have no plans to change the 90 days threshold.</p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, they will require planning permission to do so unless it already has planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to short-term letting can be sought and it will be up to each local planning authority to consider such applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures in the area and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>  <p>  These proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the proposed new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019, to allow property owners sufficient lead-in time to prepare for and adapt to the proposed new laws. In addition to the making of revised draft exempted development planning regulations, which are being progressed, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals and this element of the changes proposed is currently being developed.</p></reply>

To date, 24 hubs have been opened, providing accommodation for over 550 families.  My Department is working closely with the DRHE and other local authorities to deliver further facilities nationally as soon as possible as minimising the use of hotels and self-accommodation is critically dependant on the delivery of additional family hubs.  The location of the hubs will be a matter for individual local authorities and is dependent on the availability of suitable sites or properties.   </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that families experiencing homelessness receive the supports that they require. Rebuilding Ireland includes a programme of actions across the State Sector with involvement from a range of Government Departments and Agencies.

The Group includes representation from all of the Government Departments and Agencies involved in the delivery of homeless services, including Tusla, the HSE and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  </p>  <p>  All family hubs are operated in accordance with service level agreements/contracts between the local authorities and service providers.  In the Dublin area, the DRHE has put in place service level agreements/contracts with a range of service providers for 20 family hubs.  These agreements/contracts provide that families accessing family hub accommodation are supported in identifying and securing independent tenancies, including through the use of the HAP Placefinder service, within a six month period.  </p>  <p>  The expansion of the family hub programme will facilitate the provision of greater supports to families experiencing homelessness and facilitate more expeditious exits from homelessness into independent tenancies.  It is accepted that in some cases, due to the accommodation requirements or preferences of some families, it may not be possible to facilitate their exit from the hub within a six-month period.   As such, I have no plans to introduce regulations in this regard at this time.</p>  <p>   In relation to the duration of time spent in emergency accommodation, the quarterly performance reports prepared by the local authorities include information on the duration of time spent by individuals in emergency accommodation but do not include a breakdown for families.

The SSHA counts the number of persons with a physical disability rather than with reference to the need for wheelchair accessibility but, nonetheless, local authorities are aware of the needs of individual housing applicants through the application process. </p><p>New buildings and extensions or material alterations to existing buildings must comply with the legal minimum performance standards set out in the Building Regulations 1997 - 2017.  In this context, the Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010, and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use (2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements that a building must achieve in respect of access. The TGDs are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability: </p><p>- new buildings other than dwellings are accessible and usable;</p><p>- extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and useable;</p><p>- material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable;</p><p>- certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings where practicable; and</p><p>- new dwellings are visitable.</p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions, where practicable and appropriate.</p><p>Guidance on how to design, build and manage buildings and spaces so that they can be readily accessed and used by everyone, regardless of age, size, ability or disability is available in 'Building for Everyone, A Universal Design Approach', a National Disability Authority (NDA) publication, which may be accessed at .</p></reply>

This was followed by the publication for consultation by Dublin City Council of a detailed planning scheme for the area. The Council prepared a draft planning scheme which was considered by the elected members of the Council in May 2017. As a statutory consultee for that process, my Department highlighted the importance of the planning scheme, addressing a variety of housing needs and relevant matters.</p>  <p>  I and my Department remain committed to working with the City Council, any relevant approved housing bodies (AHBs) and either the receiver and/or developers of the SDZ area in order to secure additional social and affordable housing from this site over and above Part V obligations and of the order of magnitude laid out in the adopted planning scheme, but subject to agreement on all the normal and relevant terms, including value for money aspects.</p>  <p>  It is my Department's understanding that the receiver is engaging with Dublin City Council with a view to advancing an approach that would both better enable the orderly development of this strategic but complex city location and to assist in delivering much needed additional social housing. My Department stands ready to support such initiatives, subject to observance of all the normal value-for-money, procurement and wider legal aspects.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that there is currently an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to the Poolbeg SDZ planning scheme. The progress of development of the site will be dependent significantly on the nature and timing of the decision of the Board. Accordingly, I am not in a position to comment further on the matter at this time.</p></reply>

Within that framework, local Returning Officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums. This includes, in accordance with section 94 of the Electoral Act 1992, the provision of a sufficient number of polling stations, conveniently distributed for the accommodation of the electors entitled to vote there.</p>  <p>  Guidance issued to Returning Officers by my Department in advance of electoral events advises that when schools are used as polling stations, every step should be taken to ensure that schools are not closed unnecessarily and that disruption of school work should be kept to a minimum. The Guidance advises that, where possible, school halls should be used instead of classrooms and that voting compartments and other equipment should be fitted up and dismantled after school hours. Guidance also advises that it is open to returning officers to hire a hall or other premises if they consider it to be appropriate. Electoral law provides that a returning officer may, for the purposes of taking a poll and counting the votes, use a school or any room in a school free of charge.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the wide distribution of schools around the country helps to fulfil the requirement under electoral law to provide polling stations conveniently distributed for the accommodation of electors. Due to this requirement, and the fact that Returning Officers can, and do, choose halls and other venues as polling stations, where appropriate, research in respect of the cost of ending the use of schools as polling stations has not proven necessary. </p></reply>

Progress to date on the objectives in that strategy include the recognition of landscape in law in an amendment to the Planning and Development Acts.  The Planning and Development Acts 2000 (as amended) therefore now specify that development plans shall contain objectives for the encouragement of the management of features of the landscape, such as traditional field boundaries, important for the ecological coherence of the Natura 2000 network and essential for the migration, dispersal and genetic exchange of wild species. </p>  <p>  Further to the objective in the National Landscape Strategy to increase public awareness, the Heritage Council now provides a range of supports to organisations engaged in landscape partnerships and community projects such as the Wicklow Mountains Uplands Council, Burrenbeo and the Irish Uplands Forum. The Council has also recently engaged an uplands co-ordinator to provide support to community-based heritage projects nationally across a range of areas as well as promoting the significance of High Nature Value Farming through results based schemes.  </p>  <p>  In relation to legislation I would like to note that my Department's forthcoming Monuments and Archaeological Heritage Bill contains provisions which will give me express powers to assist and promote research and public awareness in a number of fields, including in relation to landscapes.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to say that I recently launched the public consultation phase of a new Heritage plan, Heritage Ireland 2030.  Heritage Ireland 2030 is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a revitalised and refreshed National Heritage plan.  It will provide a coherent national heritage policy, recognising its importance to local communities and global visitors alike. Community engagement will lie at the heart of Heritage Ireland 2030, reflecting the values, visions and concerns of our citizens, communities, farmers tourists and businesses. The on-going priority and associated resourcing of the National Landscape Strategy will be further determined in the context of that plan.  The consultation is open until 28 February 2019 and I hope and expect that all of those with an interest in caring for and managing our heritage will make a submission. Details of how to have your say are available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>   In the meantime, the primary role of planning authorities and the consultative roles of other bodies and persons in decision-making relating to landscape issues will continue to be governed by the provisions of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 (as amended).</p></reply>
