The area within each county that is eligible for CL&Aacute;R varies greatly.  For example, Leitrim is a relatively small county but all of Leitrim is designated as a CL&Aacute;R area.  A number of counties do not have any CL&Aacute;R areas at all. </p>  <p>  There was a huge level of interest in the CL&Aacute;R Programme this year, with almost 500 applications received.  The level of funding sought in those applications far exceeded the available budget. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, almost &euro;6 million has been allocated to 179 projects under the CL&Aacute;R programme this year. This includes funding for 8 projects in County Cork to the value of almost &euro;300,000. </p>  <p>  A total of &euro;1.89 million has now been allocated to 74 projects in Cork county as a whole since 2016 under CL&Aacute;R.  Details of all projects approved under the programme are available on the Gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  The level of funding approved under Measures 1 and 2 of the CL&Aacute;R Programme (Schools and Play Areas) this year reflected the extent of the designated CL&Aacute;R areas in each county.  Counties which have a larger percentage of their geographic area in CL&Aacute;R had more projects approved than counties that have a smaller percentage in CL&Aacute;R.  </p>  <p>  I think that the approach taken is fair, given the targeted nature of the programme.  Other counties perform well in relation to other rural and community development programmes delivered by my Department.</p></reply>

This allocation includes &euro;5 million in additional funding which I have allocated to the top 10 performing LAGs this week. </p><p>The balance of &euro;25 million is provided for thematic projects which are approved at national level.  </p><p>Total expenditure on the LEADER programme since it commenced, effectively in 2016, is almost &euro;70 million.  This includes expenditure on projects and the operating costs of the LAGs.  &euro;36.1 million has been paid out in respect of projects. </p><p>The level of project approvals under the LEADER programme has increased significantly over the last year. Over 2,400 projects have now been approved for funding of over &euro;91.8 million since the programme commenced.  A further 310 project applications, requesting in excess of &euro;26.4 million, are at various stages in the approval process.</p><p>The table which I am supplying to the Deputy provides a breakdown of the projects approved by each Local Action Group, together with details of the project payments made to date. The figures do not include expenditure or approvals under national-level thematic schemes, such as the LEADER Food Initiative and Co-operation Projects, as they are not funded from the LAGs' core project allocations. </p><p><b>Table 1: Total LEADER Project approvals and payments by LAG as at 21 October 2019</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Action Group </th>       <th><br /><br />

The Taskforce is a cross-Government initiative comprising senior officials from a number of Departments and State bodies. The Secretariat is jointly provided by the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. </p>  <p>  In my role, I work very closely with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Richard Bruton T.D., and have regular discussions with him regarding broadband provision in rural areas. </p>  <p>  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has overall policy responsibility for the National Broadband Plan.  However, the Department of Rural and Community Development works closely with that Department and with Local Authorities to help prepare rural communities for the roll out of high-speed broadband.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the mobile phone blackspot map, ComReg has made an online map of outdoor mobile coverage available on its website, www.comreg.ie. This resource provides consumers with information on the quality of mobile services, by operator, across the country.  The map was a deliverable of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.</p>  <p>  ComReg also provide information on their website on handset performance, allowing people to make informed decisions on which operator and which phone is best suited to their particular needs.</p></reply>

In addition, the first national networking event for LCDCs  will take place on 9 November and will look at leadership including in the context of Climate Action.   </p>  <p>  Additional funding will be provided in 2020 to support LCDCs in line with the recommendations of the review.</p></reply>

This is achieved through both targeted funding supports for communities and policies to support them in their important work. </p>  <p>  In August this year at the Fatima Resource Centre in Dublin I launched "Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities: a five-year strategy to support the community and voluntary sector in Ireland". </p>  <p>  This Government Strategy was development by my Department with those in the community and voluntary sector. It details actions which will support communities and their representative organisations to deliver positive outcomes within their local areas. These actions include my Department working with other government colleagues and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to scope and develop a sustainable funding model for the community and voluntary sector. </p>  <p>  I have seen first-hand the wide-ranging excellent work which is being undertaken in local communities to make lives better for those who live there.  I am delighted to have had many opportunities to visit community initiatives in Dublin that have received supports from the Department.</p>  <p>  In July I was pleased to launch Ireland&rsquo;s first National Policy on Social Enterprise at Speedpak in Coolock in Dublin 17. Speedpak, which received &euro;30,000 Dormant Accounts funding from my Department in 2017 and over &euro;290,000 under my Department's Community Services Programme during 2018 and 2019, has employed and trained over 1,150 people since it was founded in the 1990s, with significant positive impacts for individuals and families in the community.</p>  <p>  In October 2018, I visited the Lourdes Day Care Facility in Se&aacute;n Mac Dermott Street to view some of the important programmes being funded by my Department through the Dublin North East Inner City Initiative (NEIC). </p>  <p>  I have also visited a number of libraries in Dublin city, including Charleville Mall, Kevin Street and Pearse Street Libraries, all of which have benefited from the Libraries Capital Investment Programme and which are great community resources.</p>  <p>  I look forward to continuing to support these valuable community initiatives in Dublin and across the country and will continue to advocate for supports for communities across government, including through discussing these issues with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

The programme was originally launched in October 2001 but was closed for applications in 2010.  I re-opened the programme in 2016 and, since then, over 1,400 projects have been approved for CL&Aacute;R funding of almost &euro;33 million, including more than &euro;1.5 million for 61 projects in County Clare. </p><p>I launched the 2019 CL&Aacute;R programme on 28th February for projects under the following measures: </p><p>Measure 1: Support for Schools/Community Safety Measures</p><p>Measure 2: Play Areas </p><p>Measure 3: Community Wellbeing Support</p><p>3a First Response Support </p><p>3b Mobility and Cancer Care Transport</p><p>3c Sensory Gardens. </p><p>Over 490 applications were received and I have announced 179 successful projects across the 3 Measures, to the value of &euro;5.9 million this year. </p><p>The CL&Aacute;R programme makes a significant contribution to the rural communities it serves. A modest investment under the CL&Aacute;R programme, such as for the provision of a play area or specialist sensory garden, can have a significant impact on a community, by providing a safe location for children, including those with special needs, to play and for their parents to meet.  </p><p>The programme is also helping to make rural schools safer for our children and their parents by funding footpaths and traffic calming measures in the vicinity of those schools. </p><p>The CL&Aacute;R programme has also supported voluntary first-response organisations who provide an excellent and vital service in many rural areas, often under very difficult circumstances. It has funded vehicles for organisations who provide transport for service users in rural areas under the Mobility and Cancer Care Measure. This is a vital resource for all those who avail of it.  </p><p>Overall, I am very pleased with the impact which CL&Aacute;R funding is having in rural areas.  I regularly see the good projects for which the funding has been used in my engagement with communities around the country.</p></reply>

Some of the successful projects included:</p>  <p>  - The expansion of the Great Southern Greenway which received &euro;2.7 million in funding;</p>  <p>  - The construction of a multi-purpose community building in Murrow which received &euro;3.8 million in funding; and</p>  <p>  - The development of the West Limerick Tourism Gateway which received &euro;330,000 in funding.</p>  <p>  The second call for Category 1 applications for the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund closed on 6 August 2019. Category 1 projects are projects which have all necessary planning and other consents in place and are ready to proceed.  I expect to be in a position to announce the successful Category 1 projects from the second call shortly.</p>  <p>  It is planned that the second call for Category 2 applications, which relate to projects which need further development to be ready for Category 1 status, will open later in the year. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, it is important to note that this is a 10 year Fund and those who are considering applications can plan with the knowledge that the Fund will be there when their proposals are ready.  I am asking that all local authorities, State agencies, LEADER Local Action Groups and other potential lead parties work with rural communities to identify and develop ambitious projects which will deliver significant regeneration and development to their areas.  My Department will work with you to ensure the greatest possible impacts are realised by the support provided by the Fund in the years ahead.</p></reply>

This brought Ireland's total commitment to &euro;15 million. </p>  <p>  To date, Ireland has provided &euro;10.95 million of this total commitment to the Trust Fund, with the balance of &euro;4.05 million to be disbursed before the end of 2020.</p></reply>

to immediately address the problem of rapidly rising insurance premiums.  Instead, a broad series of initiatives are required to address this problem.</p>  <p>  Consequently, the Government has brought forward a number of pieces of legislation, arising from recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.  These include the following:</p>  <p>  - The Judicial Council Act 2019, which was enacted in July.  This is a key piece of legislation in the context of insurance reform.  It provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum, following the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.  It is now matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee;</p>  <p>  - The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018, which has established the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank.  This will increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will also make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;</p>  <p>  - The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019, which makes important reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, by strengthening its powers around compliance with its procedures; and,</p>  <p>  - Amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.  These were introduced through the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018.</p>  <p>  In relation to the enquiry into having an Irish public body provide insurance for the business in question, even on a temporary basis, I do not believe that this would provide a solution to those businesses impacted.  Indeed, such an approach could actually decrease competition in the Irish insurance market, with insurers potentially deciding to cease insuring certain types of risks if there is a view that the State will insure these risks instead, particularly for lines of business which are considered to be unprofitable.  This could in turn lead to a lack of choice for those seeking cover which could ultimately mean that the cost of insurance becomes even more expensive than it is now.  Also, there is no reason to believe that the State would be any better at managing risks than private insurance companies, and as a result there potentially would be a large financial exposure to the State if significant losses were incurred.  Finally, any State insurance scheme would be required to comply with the same prudential rules as private companies, thereby meaning that the cost of any insurance would still have to reflect the risk involved.  In view of these factors, I am not convinced that a State-backed insurance scheme would be a panacea with regard to the cost or availability of insurance, either for small businesses or other categories of consumers.  </p>  <p>  I believe that this makes it more important that the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country are brought more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  The establishment of the Judicial Council in the coming months is very important in this regard.  This is why I allocated &euro;1 million in Budget 2020 to allow for this.  While the Government cannot interfere in the judiciary&rsquo;s deliberations, I would expect that they will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise its establishment accordingly and take account of the Personal Injuries Commission&rsquo;s findings.</p></reply>

Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils.   </p>  <p>  Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its concessionary approach broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices. There were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand its scope to include products that should be standard rated, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover and reduce stress.</p>  <p>  Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following the review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. The removal of the concession will only apply on a prospective basis and will not be applied retrospectively by Revenue.</p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned. This allowed time for my Department to carry out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. </p>  <p>  The public consultation ran from 18 April to 24 May 2019 and sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts, the Minister for Health and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (&lsquo;HPRA&rsquo;). In total, 121 submissions were received. This included submissions from individuals, businesses, lobby groups and a political party. My officials also met with representatives from industry on several occasions in 2018 and 2019. The results of the public consultation in 2019 were included in the Tax Strategy Group paper on VAT published on my Department's website. The options set out in the TSG paper included maintaining the standard rate of VAT or introducing a reduced rate of VAT. </p>  <p>  I have decided to apply the reduced rate of VAT to all food supplement products.  This means that from 1 January 2020, food supplement products which are currently liable at the standard rate of VAT of 23% would become liable to the reduced rate of VAT of 13.5%, while those currently concessionally zero rated will also become liable to the reduced rate rather than the standard rate.  </p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that foods for specific groups such as infant follow-on formulae and infant foods, foods for special medical purposes and specially formulated foods (e.g. total diet replacement for weight control) will continue to be zero rated as they are well established and defined categories of food that are essential for vulnerable groups of the population. Fortified foods, such as yoghurts and cereals fortified with vitamins and minerals, will also continue to be zero rated as they are food.</p>  <p>  Folic acid, vitamin and mineral human oral products which are licenced or authorised as medicines by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (&lsquo;HPRA&rsquo;) will continue to be zero rated under a different VAT provision for human oral medicines.</p></reply>

However, such transfers will represent expenditure from the Exchequer account and will, hence, impact the Exchequer balance.</p>  <p>  As I outlined on Budget day, a one-off transfer of &euro;1.5 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) will be made to the Rainy Day Fund. As with the transfers from the Exchequer, the transfer from ISIF does not impact the General Government Balance. However, given that Budget 2020 was designed around the assumption of a no-deal Brexit, it was decided not to transfer &euro;500 million to the fund from the Exchequer in 2019 or 2020. This was the prudent course of action considering the uncertainty which we face, as it ensures resources are available to put in place the supports to protect our economy from the impacts of Brexit. </p>  <p>  As outlined in Table 9 of the Economic and Fiscal Outlook, a Brexit contingency of some &euro;1.2 billion has been included in the budgetary arithmetic for 2020 and this is reflected in the projected Exchequer deficit of &euro;1.6 billion for that year. Were the &euro;500 million transfer to the Rainy Day Fund to be made, this would increase the Exchequer deficit by this amount, though there would be no impact on the General Government Balance.</p></reply>

During this transition period, Union law shall be applicable to and in the United Kingdom. This means that, from a customs standpoint, there will be no checks during this period. </p>  <p>  It is only after the UK has left the EU that formal negotiations can commence on the future EU-UK economic relationship, based on the broad terms outlined in the Political Declaration. The Political Declaration contains the shared ambition to have a Future Trade Agreement with zero tariffs and quotas between the EU and the UK. Given that these negotiations have yet to commence, it would not be appropriate to comment on the nature of future checks that may be required. It is important to note however, that it is still the case that the UK is leaving the EU and this will bring change. It is important that Ireland is ready for that change, both for our citizens and out business, and our work to prepare for all scenarios surrounding the UK&rsquo;s exit continues.</p>  <p>  In planning for Brexit, Revenue had determined that in an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU, to include a transition period and the implementation of a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and UK, an additional 600 Revenue staff would be required. This was based on the introduction of  customs formalities for East-West trade between Ireland and the UK. This recruitment was accelerated in preparation for a potential No Deal exit on 31 October. This requirement for an additional 600 staff remains Revenue&rsquo;s best estimate of the resources that will be required in the context of the current proposed Brexit deal to facilitate and support legitimate trade.</p>  <p>  In a Brexit context, the efficient flow of trade through our ports and airports is a key priority for the Government and various government departments and agencies have undertaken and continue to undertake significant preparations to facilitate this post-Brexit. During 2018, Revenue chaired an Inter-Departmental group which was established to consider the adequacy of port and airport infrastructure and facilities, post-Brexit. The group included representatives from Revenue; the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine (DAFM); the Department of Health; the HSE&rsquo;s Environmental Health Service (EHS); the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (DTTS); the OPW; the Department of Justice; and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  I am advised that the group considered the physical infrastructure requirements for both the &lsquo;Central Case&rsquo; and the &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenarios to facilitate and support the movement of legitimate trade. This included the requirements of Revenue; DAFM; and the HSE&rsquo;s EHS; to carry out any necessary customs interventions and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks at ports and airports as a result of Brexit.  The group identified that infrastructure was required at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport and agreed proposals on the nature and scale of new or extended facilities that would be required. The Office of Public Works (OPW) are responsible for the delivery of the necessary infrastructure. Temporary facilities are in place for 31 October 2019 in the event of a no-deal Brexit. OPW are currently working to ensure that these temporary facilities will be replaced by permanent facilities by 1 January 2021 which will accommodate the full requirements of the different agencies from that date.</p></reply>

This included, at Box 4, an assessment of the macroeconomic outlook that would apply in the event of an agreed exit by the UK at end October. </p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement endorsed by the European Council, will now require ratification by the European Parliament and the British Parliament. Pending ratification of the deal, it is not possible to say if the outlook will be different to that set out in Budget 2020. </p>  <p>  If the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified, the UK will enter a transition period until at least the end of 2020. In this situation the outlook would be broadly similar to that set out in Table 4 (Box 4) in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This shows that, in the event of an agreed exit, GDP growth is forecast to be 3.1 per cent in 2020, with employment growth projected at 1.7 per cent next year and the unemployment rate expected to be 5.1 per cent. </p>  <p>  Until there is greater clarity on the post-transition relationship there is likely to be continued uncertainty, particularly with respect to private sector investment. There are a range of possible future relationships, ranging from a free trade agreement (of which there could be many forms), or a trading relationship under World Trade Organisation (WTO) frameworks. The impact of these have been modelled and estimated earlier this year in joint research by the Department of Finance and ESRI. Over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) the level of GDP would be of the order of between 1.9 and 3.3 per cent lower, compared to a situation where the UK remains in the EU. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments with respect to the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the future relationship with the UK, and will update the macroeconomic and fiscal projections to take account of any developments in the Spring. </p></reply>

As set out in this table, before taking account of certain Brexit related costs of &euro;1.2 billion and timing related cash costs of &euro;169 million, the overall increase in core voted expenditure on public services and infrastructure in 2020 is estimated at &euro;3,371 million. After taking account of discretionary revenue measures of over &euro;0.4 billion, this results in a net budgetary package of over &euro;2.9 billion.  This compares to the projected budgetary package of &euro;2.8 billion set out in the Summer Economic Statement. </p>  <p>  The Brexit related expenditure of &euro;1.2 billion is made up of:</p>  <p>  - &euro;650 million to support the sectors identified as most affected by Brexit; Agriculture, Enterprise and Tourism, and to help stabilise the worst affected regions;</p>  <p>  - &euro;365 million in Social Protection expenditure on the Live Register and Related schemes;</p>  <p>  - &euro;45 million for Labour market activation supports; and</p>  <p>  - a further amount of &euro;160 million, relative to the Revised Estimates Volume 2019, to ensure that the staff, facilities and infrastructure are in place at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport to allow for the necessary compliance checks to be carried out by the regulatory agencies.</p>  <p>  As the risk of a disorderly Brexit increased, preparations for essential compliance checks by our regulatory agencies that would be required in the event of a disorderly Brexit were accelerated, with recruitment of additional staff and development of facilities and infrastructure. Consequently, as outlined in Table 1 on page 24 of Expenditure Report 2020, &euro;51 million of the estimated costs, primarily related to staff required to carry out compliance checks at the ports and airport, are included in the departmental Budget Estimates for 2020. The allocation of the balance of funding in relation to facilities and infrastructure for compliance checks will be assessed taking into account the up to date Brexit position, including the expected form of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union and future relationship. </p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the sectoral expenditure of &euro;650 million will be released in multiple tranches. Adopting a multi-tranche approach to expenditure management of required Brexit policy is prudent as it helps to facilitate responses to a wide range of possible Brexit impacts, which may take time to fully materialise.</p>  <p>  The additional funding for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection would also be made available in the event of a no-deal Brexit. </p>  <p>  As part of normal budgetary processes the allocation of these additional funds would either be provided in the allocations set out in the Revised Estimates Volume; included as Further Revised Estimates; or allocated via Supplementary Estimates, as may be appropriate in each case. </p>  <p>  Of course, mitigating the effects of Brexit has been a feature not just of Budget 2020, but over the last three years as well. This has included initiatives to increase competitiveness and embed greater resilience in our economy. For these ongoing initiatives, which are already in place, approximately &euro;0.2 billion is included within the Departmental allocations published on Budget Day. This amount is additional to the &euro;1.2 billion discussed above.</p></reply>

Westmeath), the Office of Public Works (OPW) and Westmeath County Council (WCC) are working together to advance flood relief works for the town with WCC as the Contracting Authority and OPW funding the costs of the works in addition to undertaking the construction works with its own workforce.  Engineering consultants were appointed in April 2017, to identify appropriate flood risk alleviation measures for Athlone.  The Option Appraisal Report identified eight discrete cells of flood defence works. These flood cells are each being progressed individually under Part 8 or Part 10 of the Planning and Development Regulations.  It is anticipated that the construction works for the Athlone Flood Alleviation Scheme will be completed during 2021.</p><p>Consultants have also been commissioned by the OPW and/or the relevant Local Authority to undertake the design, development and planning of Flood Relief Schemes in Springfield<b></b>(Co. Clare) and Castleconnell<b></b>(Co. Limerick).  Procurement is scheduled to commence in the coming months to appoint Engineering Consultants for the design, development and planning of Flood Relief Schemes in Limerick City &amp;amp; Environs, Leitrim Village and Carrick-on-Shannon (Co. Leitrim), and Killaloe/Ballina (Co. Clare/Tipperary).  It is intended to progress the development of flood relief schemes in Dromod<b></b>(Co. Leitrim) and Portumna<b></b>(Co. Galway) within the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018 to 2027.</p><p>The Government also established the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group in 2016 to support existing plans in place to address flooding on the Shannon and to enhance the ongoing co-operation of all State Agencies involved with the River Shannon.  The Group has taken a number of significant decisions since its establishment, including targeted maintenance activities at a number of locations, trialling the lowering of the levels on Lough Allen, studies to explore managing flood risk at the Callows and a study on the cause, degree and rate of restriction downstream of Parteen Weir.  The Group is also considering a feasible long term maintenance programme for the River Shannon.</p></reply>

In June 2016, the Revised Estimates were amended, and a total of &euro;13.695 billion was allocated to the Health Vote for current expenditure. Up until that point, all spending was based on Section 2 of the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965 which allows spending up to four-fifths of the amount appropriated in the previous year&rsquo;s Appropriation Act. Please note that this was not a Further Revised Estimate; the Revised Estimates were simply agreed at a later stage than usual due to the dissolution of the D&aacute;il. </p>  <p>  The additional funding was provided to the Department of Health to deal with spending pressures, including overspends in the acute sector and PCRS up until the point at which the Revised Estimates were agreed, and to ensure that service levels were maintained in relation to health and social care. A Supplementary Estimate was not required for the Health Vote in 2016, as total spending was maintained within the overall ceiling as set out in the Revised Estimates (&euro;14.109 billion).</p></reply>

In particular the sector needs to engage with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social protection who have responsibility for EURES the (European Employment Services), and who are well positioned to help sectors to recruit from within the EEA.  </p>  <p>  A further review  of the Occupational Lists is currently underway.

For craft apprenticeships, this cost would typically be one third of the &euro;3,000 ASC paid by students attending for the full academic year and so amounts to approximately &euro;1,000 per apprentice per period spent in the institution.  Pro rata amounts are also charged to apprentices on new apprenticeship programmes that include a period in a higher education institution.  These amounts vary based on the time spent in the institution.</p>  <p>  The total estimated annual cost per apprentice in craft apprenticeships, which span the construction, engineering, electrical and motor mechanics sectors is &euro;7,159.  This figure comes from the recently published Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Spending Review of Apprenticeships. </p>  <p>  The review also provides an average annual cost of &euro;9,877 for new apprenticeships but as this figure includes the development costs for these new programmes, it somewhat overstates the true ongoing cost of providing new apprenticeship places.  Due to the majority of these programmes only coming into operation in recent years and the overall population being relatively low there is insufficient information to derive a reliable average cost, however this will be kept under review as greater numbers come on stream.  The new apprenticeships span a wide range of sectors, including biopharma, finance, hairdressing, hospitality and food and ICT. </p></reply>

An allocation of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2019. I am also pleased to have secured an overall increase of &euro;122 million to increase An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's budget to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for next year. Very significant capital investment is also being made, including investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Furthermore, decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda equipment and resources, including ICT resources and the networking of Garda stations, are matters for the Garda Commissioner in light of availability of resources and identified operational demands.  As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that broadband networks and services are used to connect stations to the Garda network for official purposes. All of the connections to the Garda stations are managed in the telecommunications branch of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the speed of the network connection meets the requirements of the particular location.</p>  <p>  There are 565 Garda stations in the State. I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the number which are networked can vary but that at present, 519 of these stations are fully networked.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that any member attached to a currently unconnected station can access PULSE at their local district station.  Members in non-networked locations can also contact the Garda Information Services Center (GISC) or an associated networked station if required.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Garda authorities that options for providing members attached to those remaining stations not yet networked with local access to Garda ICT services are actively being explored.  This includes an assessment of the availability or otherwise of local broadband services and/or the provision of mobile technology.</p></reply>

I am pleased to have secured an overall increase of &euro;122 million to increase An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s budget for 2020 to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for next year in addition to &euro;116million in capital investment.  This level of funding will allow the Garda Commissioner to recruit up to 700 new Garda&iacute; next year and additional Garda staff, the balance of which will be an operational matter for the Commissioner to decide. </p><p>This ongoing investment is intended to support growth in the organisation as well as the ambitious Garda reform plan, with the overall goal of ensuring a visible, professional and effective policing service to all our communities, urban and rural, now and into the future. </p><p>The Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing and controlling the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including by arranging for the recruitment and training of personnel.  Further, the allocation of Garda resources and distribution of personnel are a matter for the Commissioner, in light of identified operational demands. </p><p>I am pleased to say that recruitment of Garda members and staff is ongoing - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation. We currently have over 14,200 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,800 Garda staff. And as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, there is ongoing and increased recruitment both of new Garda&iacute; as well as Garda staff, allowing for redeployment of Garda&iacute; to operational duties at the front-line.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda Training College in 2014, approximately 2,800 new Garda members have attested and been assigned to frontline policing duties in communities throughout the country. Another 200 probationer Garda&iacute; are due to attest by the end of this year. Further, the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s decision to recruit a net 600 Garda staff in 2019 will allow for the redeployment of approximately 500 experienced Garda&iacute; to frontline and visible policing duties by the end of this year. </p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table outlines the approximate cost of hiring an additional 10 members and an additional 100 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2020 and the costs of those members for the second, third, fourth and fifth year. I am further informed that this estimate assumes that all new recruits commence training on 1 January 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th>Number of Recruits</th>       <th>Year 1 - 2020</th>       <th>Year 2 -  2021</th>       <th>Year 3 - 2022</th>       <th>Year 4 - 2023</th>       <th>Year 5 -  2024</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10</td>       <td>239,071</td>       <td>467,545</td>       <td>497,016</td>       <td>533,931</td>       <td>560,757</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>100</td>       <td>2,390,710</td>       <td>4,675,450</td>       <td>4,970,160</td>       <td>5,339,310</td>       <td>5,607,570</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am further informed that it should be noted that payroll costs for new Garda recruits include a basic allowance of &euro;184 per week.  After 32 weeks of training, Garda recruits are attested and move on to the first point of the Garda pay scale &euro;30,980 (on the basis of the pay scale which will be in operation on completion of training in August 2020).  These figures include Employer's PRSI and an estimate of allowances which Garda members may qualify for depending on their assignments.  Finally, I am informed that the annual cost will increase as the members move up the Garda pay scale each year.</p></reply>

For example, family members and friends often elect or are assigned a shared cell.  Shared cell accommodation can be very beneficial from a management point of view, particularly for those who are vulnerable and at risk of self-harm.  There will always be a need for certain prisoners to be accommodated together.</p><p>Regarding sanitation, it is important to note that there has been significant reform and modernisation of the Prison Estate in recent years which has delivered in cell sanitation to Cork and Mountjoy Prisons. The current Limerick Prison redevelopment will deliver in cell sanitation for all prisoners in this prison.</p></reply>

These are in addition to the units previously established in DMR West, Cork City and Louth Divisions. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I recently welcomed the Garda Commissioner's adoption of a new Garda Operating Model which will see the number of Garda Divisions reduce from 28 to 19. This functional model has long been recommended by independent policing specialists, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and is also in the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland (CoFPI).  Rollout of this model meets a key commitment in A Policing Service for the Future, the four-year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Commissioner's plan allows for Divisions of sufficient scale to be self-sufficient in the delivery of services, which will include greater availability of expertise, including  in addressing domestic and sexual violence in each area. </p>  <p>  I am informed by Garda management that it is expected that Divisional Protective Services Units should be rolled-out to the remaining Garda Divisions on a phased basis by the end of 2019. This expected timetable is in accordance with the target set out in 'A Policing Service for the Future'.</p></reply>

The programme is an essential part of Government strategy to help tackle youth crime, administered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it is very important that it operates effectively.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the operation of the Garda Diversion Programme is monitored by a Committee established under Section 44 of the Children Act 2001, whose annual reports are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. These reports include statistics on referrals to the Garda Diversion Programme. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of children referred for consideration under the Garda Diversion Programme in 2017 was 10,607. The figures for 2018 and to date in 2019 are not yet available. However, I am informed the 2018 Report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of this year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that an expert Steering Group is currently developing a new Youth Justice Strategy, including a review of the Children Act. The Steering Group commenced its work in February and has had a series of meetings during this year which will continue into next year. </p>  <p>  The Group is tasked with advising and guiding the development of the new Strategy, including consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, from early intervention and preventative work, including family support, diversion from crime, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.  It is intended to have a draft Strategy for public consultation by the end of this year and that the Strategy will be finalised in the first half of 2020.</p></reply>

The Local Enterprise Offices are the first-stop-shop for all businesses in every county, and will be able to help guide entrepreneurs and business owners on the most appropriate supports for their circumstances. Alternatively, the full range of supports available to Irish businesses can be accessed through my Department's dedicated SME web-portal at www.supportingsmes.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  Without more detailed information on, for example, the size of the business described or its number of employees, it is difficult to identify which specific supports may be most relevant to the business. However, it is most likely that an expansion by such a business would be suitable for funding under the Future Growth Loan Scheme, which provides funding for long-term strategic investment. </p>  <p>  This scheme makes up to &euro;300 million worth of loans available with a term of eight to ten years and is open to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the agriculture and seafood sectors. Finance provided under the scheme is competitively priced and has favourable terms, for example, no security is required for loans up to &euro;500,000. Loans to businesses under the scheme can be used to fund investments in equipment, machinery, buildings and associated overhead costs for organisational and/or process innovation. </p>  <p>  This scheme features a two-stage application process. Applications for eligibility under the scheme are made through the SBCI website. The SBCI assesses the applications and successful applicants are issued an eligibility reference number, which they can then use to apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures.</p>  <p>  As of 18 October, there have been 1,551 successful applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 376 have progressed to sanction at bank level to a total value of &euro;64.39 million.</p>  <p>I am committed to ensuring that every business with growth ambition has access to the most appropriate and coherent set of supports to meet their needs. To that end, my Department has recently released an Overview of Government Supports for Indigenous Businesses, which is available on my Department's website.   </p></reply>

Its main vehicle for encouraging female-led export businesses is its Competitive Start Fund for Female Entrepreneurs. </p><p>The aim of this fund is to accelerate the growth of female founded start-up companies that have the potential to employ more than ten people and achieve &euro;1 million in export sales. Under the scheme, companies receive up to &euro;50,000 equity investment to enable them to reach key commercial and technical milestones which will ensure the delivery of their product or service to an international audience. </p><p>The maximum support available is &euro;50,000 for a 10% ordinary equity stake in the start-up company and &euro;1,750 for mentor assignments per company.

This funding will support the purchase and/or fit out of vehicles to provide transport for people in rural areas with mobility issues. It will support voluntary organisations that provide:- </p>  <p>  -  transport for people with significant mobility issues, including those requiring specialised  wheelchair accessible vehicles, to day-care or other medical, therapeutic or respite services; or </p>  <p>  -  transport to/from designated cancer treatment hospitals/centres under the National Cancer Care Programme.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy might be interested to know that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty T.D., has commissioned research into the cost of disability.  The cost of disability can be defined as the amount it costs a person with a disability to achieve the same standard of living as those persons without a disability.  This includes extra living costs such as heating; disability aids and equipment; medical and drug costs; care costs and transport costs.  Following a procurement process, Indecon International Consultants have been commissioned by that Department to carry out this research.  It is hoped that the research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, from a whole-of-Government perspective. </p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability. </p></reply>

However, the HSE has assured the Department that people on the waiting list are reviewed, as funding becomes available, to ensure that individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within the available resources and as determined by the local front line staff who know and understand the clients&rsquo; needs, and who undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure that the services being provided remain appropriate.</p>  <p>  In line with commitments given in the Programme for Government we have made improved access to home support services a priority in Budget 2020. An additional investment of &euro;52 million is being made in 2020 which will provide over 19.2 million hours of home support. This is 1 million hours more than the 2019 target and represents a substantial increase in service provision.  This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home and, as appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for older people. </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to address the cost-based analysis aspect of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2019, the NHSS is expected to support 23,042 people in 2019. The NHSS budget for 2019 is &euro;985.8m which is an increase of &euro;24.3m over its 2018 budget.</p>  <p>  Over the last two years, an additional &euro;45 million has been provided to NHSS budget for the continued provision of services in line with pricing and demand. As part of normal governance and performance management arrangements The Department and the HSE maintain regular service area engagements, which also form part of ongoing collaborative work on issues relating to older persons policy and service delivery. </p>  <p>  The HSE have noted that the number of residents in nursing homes whom are supported by the NHSS to be ahead of forecast for the year to date.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the available budget and the demand for support, the HSE releases funding in a managed way to ensure that the operation of the NHSS remains within the budgetary allocation. To manage the available funds throughout the year, a national placement list for the release of funding is operated by the HSE, to enable it to operate within budget. Funding issues to applicants in chronological order, to ensure equity nationally. Approved applicants are placed on the national placement list in order of their approval date and funding is released to applicants in order of their place on this list. The length of time spent on the placement list depends on the number of applicants currently receiving financial support and the number of new applications. Where demand is higher, the time spent on the waiting list may increase having regard for the prudent management of the Scheme's budget. </p>  <p>  In the context of planning and preparing for the challenges of the winter period, the Department and the HSE have been considering a comprehensive approach to delayed transfers of care (DTOCs). An additional &euro;26m has been made available for the last quarter of 2019 to support the hospital and community system to improve patient egress. The investment is supporting home support and transitional care as well as keeping the waiting time for access to support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) at 4 weeks to the end of the year. The HSE were authorised to take immediate action in that regard last month, and released significant support to over 700 people to take up places under the NHSS and over 300 transitional care bed approvals. My Department is continuing active engagement with the HSE with regard to planning for the winter ahead. I understand that, as of 21st October, there are 433 people on the NHSS National Placement List and the wait time for funding release is within 4 weeks on average.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-24a.468.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019102400062#WRH01800"><p>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) was established in 2007. HIQA is an independent authority established to drive high-quality and safe care for health and social care services in Ireland. HIQA&rsquo;s mandate extends across a range of public, private and voluntary sector services. Reporting to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, HIQA&rsquo;s role is to develop standards, inspect and review health and social care services and support informed decisions on how services are delivered.</p>  <p>  HIQA operates under the Health Act 2007, which sets out the functions which the Authority is to carry out. HIQA has responsibility for setting standards for healthcare services, and monitoring compliance with those standards. It also regulates facilities providing care for the elderly and those with disabilities, and has a role with regard to inspecting some of the social care services which are accessed by children to determine if they are meeting the relevant National Standards.  In addition, it undertakes functions in relation to Health Information and Health Technology Assessment. </p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Act sets out the grounds under which HIQA may undertake an investigation into a particular service, or may be requested to undertake such an investigation by the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  The Act provides HIQA with the power to set standards for the healthcare services delivered by the HSE, and then to undertake monitoring programmes to assess compliance with these standards. In this regard, HIQA published the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare in 2012; they represent the overarching standard which public health services are expected to meet. Flowing from these themes, HIQA have also developed standards for particular services, e.g. National Standards for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections in acute healthcare services. HIQA has in turn conducted a thematic inspection programme against these standards since 2012, which has resulted in the publication of over 300 reports of inspection visits to date. In addition, HIQA has also undertaken thematic inspection programmes in relation to nutrition and hydration in acute hospitals, and in relation to medication safety. </p>  <p>  In such cases, HIQA typically undertakes both announced and unannounced inspections of healthcare facilities in order to ascertain the degree of adherence to expected standards. A report of the inspection visit will subsequently be published on HIQA&rsquo;s website, and frequently attracts media attention. In cases where remedial action is required, depending on the severity of the risk identified, HIQA may draw the matter to the attention of hospital management during the inspection and request an immediate response, or in less severe cases, will raise the issue in writing. In either case, an appropriate management response would be expected. </p>  <p>  Further standards also continue to be developed i.e. most recently the National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services and National Standards for the Conduct of Review of Patient Safety Incidents.</p>  <p>  The Patient Safety Licensing Bill, in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy, will see HIQA become the licensing authority for all hospitals and certain designated activities. The Bill will, for the first time, introduce a licensing requirement for all hospitals, public and private, and certain designated high risk activities in the community. It was approved by Government in December 2017 and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health on 13 June 2018.</p>  <p>  HIQA will be the licensing body, with statutory powers to require hospitals to undertake improvements and the authority to remove a licence from a service which is failing to meet required standards.</p>  <p>  In advance of a formal licensing regime for public and private hospitals it is proposed that the Patient Safety Bill will bring the private/independent healthcare sector within the remit of the Health Act 2007. The proposed bill will extend HIQA&rsquo;s powers to set and monitor standards, and undertake investigations, where necessary, to the private acute hospital sector. The Patient Safety Bill underwent Pre-Legislative Scrutiny at the Oireachtas Health Committee on 26 September 2018.  Officials of my Department and the OPC are continuing to progress this legislation.  It is expected that the Patient Safety Bill will be brought to Cabinet next month.  </p>  <p>   It should also be noted that HIQA is now responsible for the regulation of medical exposure to ionising radiation. This follows my signing of the new Statutory Instrument 256/2018 on 9th January last governing the regulation of medical exposures to ionising radiation.  </p>  <p>  HIQA was designated to take on the responsibilities of the &ldquo;Competent Authority&rdquo; for Medical Ionizing Radiation, as required by European Directive 2013/59/Euratom. These functions formerly resided with the HSE, however the transfer of responsibility was required in order to ensure Ireland complied with the European regulations. Such a move was also recommended by the International Atomic Agency in its review of Irish regulatory practice in this area. </p>  <p>  I have set out above the current responsibilities of HIQA, and the additional roles it is expected to acquire in the coming period. However, I can also assure the Deputy that HIQA's role and remit will continue to be kept under review by my Department. </p></reply>

As our population, particularly our older population continues to grow, key projections from the analysis indicate, for the period 2016-2021</p>  <p>  -  12% growth in overall population;</p>  <p>  -  59% growth in 65+ population; and</p>  <p>  -  95% growth in 85+ population.</p>  <p>  The review notes that if key reforms and productivity measures are implemented, a 120% increase in home supports will be required by 2031.</p>  <p>  In line with commitments given in the Programme for Government we have made improved access to home support services a priority in Budget 2020. An additional investment of &euro;52 million is being made in 2020 which will provide over 19.2 million hours of home support. This is 1 million hours more than the 2019 target and represents a substantial increase in service provision.  This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home and, as appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for older people.</p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.   The Department of Health is currently developing plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services for older people and adults with a disability. Included in this investment is dedicated funding for the testing of the new statutory home-support scheme in 2020. </p>  <p>  The design of the new scheme will involve the establishment of a model of service with a streamlined central system of administration to improve and simplify how people access home-support services. While the administration of the scheme will be centralised, the delivery of services will be co-ordinated at local level in line with a person&rsquo;s assessed need. A core component of the Scheme and the testing phase will be the implementation of InterRAI, as the standardised assessment tool for determining need under the new scheme.</p></reply>

The Plan targets a 30% increase in production derived from onshore close containment recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Considerable international developmental effort is being put into land based RAS systems. A number of technological challenges need to be overcome to make RAS economically viable. </p>  <p>  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara funded a 2015 study by the Irish Salmon Growers Association &lsquo;Potential for Land Based Salmon Growout in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) in Ireland&rsquo;. The report describes in detail all technical aspects of RAS production and system design and operations. It also covers important biological aspects of land based salmon production. </p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme, an aquaculture Knowledge Gateway Scheme is being implemented by BIM.  In close collaboration with aquaculture enterprises and researchers, the Scheme aims to develop knowledge, innovation and technology in the aquaculture sector to ensure its sustainable development. An important part of the focus of the Scheme will be the applied research and development on RAS identified in the National Strategic Plan. This may take the form of applied research undertaken by BIM on behalf of the sector or initiatives from industry operators or research institutions. Universities and Institutes of Technology can avail of 100% grants up to a value of &euro;500,000 under the Knowledge Gateway Scheme to conduct research, studies and trials into RAS technology, while aquaculture enterprises can receive grants of 50% with a value of up to &euro;200,000. </p>  <p>  To further incentivise RAS developments, I made 50% grants up to value of &euro;1 million available to aquaculture enterprises under the EMFF Sustainable Aquaculture Scheme for capital investment in commercial RAS developments.  </p>  <p>  In 2019, BIM is continuing its research into Recirculating Aquaculture Multitrophic Pond Systems (RAMPS), which has been underway since 2016, funded through a number of EMFF grants under the Knowledge Gateway Scheme.  RAMPS is a novel production method developed by BIM. The system involves utilising cutaway peatlands and poor agricultural land for freshwater fish production. The system has the potential to significantly increase Ireland&rsquo;s aquaculture production of organic produce in a sustainable and cost-effective way. The project involves cultivation of perch and trout in earthen ponds utilising duckweed and algae for bioremediation. Subsequently, it is envisaged that the duckweed will be harvested and may be utilised in the cosmetic, animal protein and pharmaceutical sectors.</p></reply>

Government has committed to delivering a whole of Government approach, and to working with local stakeholders, to ensuring that a just transition is provided to those impacted by the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>  <p>  Further details of this comprehensive whole of Government response to support the region through the transition will be announced shortly. Budget 2020 includes a number of measures that form part of this response. These include:</p>  <p>  -  &euro;6 million for a Just Transition Fund;</p>  <p>  -  &euro;5 million for bog restoration and rehabilitation; and </p>  <p>  -  &euro;20 million to deliver a new model to group housing upgrades. </p>  <p>  The Just Transition Fund will be initially targeted at the Midlands and will support retraining and reskilling workers and assist local communities and businesses in the Midlands to adjust to the low carbon transition. There will be further engagement with local stakeholders, including the Midlands Transition Team, on the application of the funding. </p>  <p>  The bog restoration and rehabilitation fund will support the National Parks and Wildlife Service to restore to their natural habitat 1,800 hectares of bog. This restoration will return these bogs to carbon sinks once more, which, over the next 5 years, will result in 28 million tonnes of carbon being stored. 70 jobs will be created in Year One, rising to 100 as the programme develops. </p>  <p>  The delivery of a new model to group housing upgrades together is set out in the Climate Action Plan. The &euro;20m allocated in the budget will be targeted at the Midlands and will support an estimated 400 jobs directly and indirectly, as well as significantly upgrading the social housing stock in the region during 2020. </p>  <p>  I have also announced that a Just Transition Commissioner will be appointed. This Commissioner will engage with all relevant stakeholders in the Midlands, including Bord na M&oacute;na, the Midland Regional Transition Team, Trade Unions as well as the National Economic and Social Council (NESC). This appointment will be part of the Government&rsquo;s Just Transition Plan, which is currently being led by the Department of An Taoiseach. Further details on this role will be provided as part of an announcement on the All-of-Government response to support the Midlands region through the transition.</p></reply>

However, the Excellence in Energy Efficient Design (EXEED) grant scheme can be applied to any investment project where energy is a factor. EXEED has supported a number of projects in the Leisure Sector. Power generating treadmills and exercise bikes could form part of an overall investment in an energy efficiency project in a leisure centre. </p>  <p>  Beyond the specific grant supports available, the SEAI also provides information and advisory services to businesses. These range from an SME guide to energy efficiency and case study examples of best practice to advice on energy efficiency design. New online audio-visual modules for businesses focusing on energy efficiency opportunities are also being developed and will be available in the coming months. </p>  <p>  By availing of these supports and improving their energy efficiency, businesses can cut costs as well as carbon, free up resources that can be invested in more productive activity, improve their competiveness, resilience, and green credentials. I would encourage all businesses to engage with SEAI to benefit from these supports.</p></reply>

Funded by my Department and administered by Enterprise Ireland through the national network of 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), the scheme offers financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, subject to matched funding, to help small businesses to develop their online trading capability. This is coupled with training, mentoring and networking supports. Small businesses, with 10 or fewer employees, less than &euro;2m in turnover, and that have little or no capacity to trade online, are eligible to apply.</p>  <p>  The Trading Online Voucher Scheme budget forms part of my Department's Communications Programme budget for 2020. Detailed allocations at subhead level will be published in the revised estimates volume in December 2019. It is anticipated that in the region of 1,250 vouchers will be approved in 2020, which is of the same order as 2019. The Trading Online Voucher Scheme is, however, demand-led and as a result the level of funding drawn down by the LEOs is dependent on the level of approved applications.</p></reply>

This is a significant increase on Budget 2019's allocation of &euro;48 million toward the same two programmes. </p>  <p>  Separately there is also a &euro;23 million allocation for the Greenways programme, which supports leisure-orientated walking and cycling.  This is a significant increase on Budget 2019's allocation of &euro;13million toward the same programme.</p>  <p>  Together these three funding programmes total &euro;114 million next year and that includes the &euro;9 million additional allocation, split evenly across active travel and greenways programmes, which arises from the introduction of carbon tax measures. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that allocations made available under these funding programmes  do not capture all public expenditure dedicated to active travel (or leisure-orientated walking and cycling);  it also benefits from funding provided under BusConnects, the roads programmes, the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme and from the tax incentive available under the Cycle-to-Work Scheme.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt the Deputy welcomes these increased allocations and looks forward, as I do, to the delivery of a number of important projects across the country in 2020.</p></reply>

Irish airlines also operate with relatively high passenger load factors meaning emissions, on a per passenger basis, compare favourably with other airlines in Europe.</p><p>Operational initiatives to improve air traffic flows can also reduce fuel burn and emissions. The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) and airlines actively engage in such initiatives e.g. the ENSURE and Dublin Point Merge projects. The future space-based navigation and positioning system , in which IAA is a partner, will feed into optimised flight operations across the globe also reducing emissions.</p><p>On market based measures, Irish airlines have participated in the EU-ETS scheme since 2012. The inclusion of intra-European flights in the EU ETS has delivered around 100 million tonnes of CO2 reductions/offsets between 2012 and 2018. Since 1 January 2019, Irish airlines are monitoring emissions via modified EU-ETS templates to prepare participation in ICAO&rsquo;s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme in International Aviation from the pilot phase in 2021. CORSIA aims at carbon neutral growth in aviation from 2020.</p><p>Finally, Ireland supports efforts towards the production and use of sustainable aviation fuels that produce less or no carbon. Work in this area needs to be prioritised, particularly at an EU level, to incentivise research, production and use of those fuels.</p></reply>

The Master Licence Record (MLR) programme was approved by the previous Minister of this Department, and the Minister for Justice and Equality. The programme seeks to assist in the endorsement of penalty points by matching vehicle and driver records on my Departments National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF), and over time, by establishing owner identity for all vehicle records. </p>  <p>  The first two phases of the MLR matching project are now complete. These phases involved associating vehicle owner records with driver records by matching existing NVDF records. The MLR now contains 1.3 million records, which includes 33% of currently-taxed vehicle records. This matching process is run every week by my Departments officials after which a file containing the vehicle-driver associations  is sent to An Garda Sioch&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  Phase 2 of the MLR programme primarily involves establishing vehicle owner identity when individuals engage with other Departmental systems, such as change of vehicle ownership and application for motor tax.  Although legislation and legal advice are still pending on some measures, systems are currently in development to establish vehicle owner identity with regard to the registration of privately-imported vehicles and online change of vehicle ownership between private individuals.</p>  <p>  Just over &euro;1.5m was spent on the project for the period January to September 2019 inclusive. The budget for the programme in 2020 has not yet finalised. Any development costs in this regard will be met from my Department's Revised Estimate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-24a.708.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019102400065#WRL04700"><p>The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 (SOLAS Convention) is an international convention of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) relating to the safety of ships (both passenger ships and cargo ships of >500 gross tonnes) that are engaged on international voyages.  The Convention entered into force in 1980 and Ireland is a party to it since 1983. </p>  <p>  The SOLAS Convention sets the international safety standards for ships&rsquo; construction, equipment and operation.  As a party to the Convention, and in its role as a Flag State, Ireland is responsible for ensuring and certifying that ships on the Irish register that undertake international voyages comply with the relevant SOLAS requirements, which vary according to the size of the ship and the year of construction. </p>  <p>  The SOLAS Convention is amended on a continual basis to take into account technical evolution and practical experiences.  Such amendments are made at meetings of the Maritime Safety Committee of the IMO, which are held once or twice a year, as decided by the Committee.</p>  <p>  Primary legislation to give effect to the SOLAS Convention is provided for in the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Act 1952, the Merchant Shipping Act 1966, the Merchant Shipping Act 2010 and most recently in the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Act 2014.  The Acts in general provide a framework for implementation of the SOLAS Convention through the making of secondary legislation containing the detailed technical Rules and Regulations. </p>  <p>  Numerous statutory instruments have been made over the years to give effect to the individual SOLAS Chapters and the subject matter contained in the Convention. Work is continuing in so far as is possible within existing resources to address ongoing IMO amendments.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Maritime Safety Policy Division of my Department are working on a general scheme for a planned Merchant Shipping (International Conventions) Bill.  This is at the preparatory stages in my Department, prior to seeking Government approval for its drafting in due course.  The main purpose of the Bill is to provide the required legislative framework for Ireland to become a party to a number of international maritime conventions. The Bill also provides an opportunity to update the definition of the SOLAS Convention in primary legislation, which will enable Ireland to make the necessary statutory instruments to give effect to the latest amendments to the Convention. </p>  <p>  Additionally, under Port State Control, foreign ships in national ports are inspected to verify that the condition of the ship and its equipment complies with the requirements of international conventions (including the SOLAS Convention) and that the ship is manned and operated in compliance with those conventions.</p>  <p>  Port State Control inspections are carried out by the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of my Department while Flag State activities are undertaken by both the MSO and by authorised Recognised Organisations on their behalf.</p>  <p>  As regards the transposition of the named EU Directives, I can confirm that Directive 2013/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2013 on recreational craft and personal watercraft (or the "EU Recreational Craft Directive") was transposed into Irish law through S.I. No. 65 of 2017 - the European Union (Recreational Craft and Personal Watercraft) Regulations 2017. </p>  <p>  Directive 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on marine equipment (or the "Marine Equipment Directive") was transposed into Irish law through S.I. No. 177 of 2017 - the European Union (Marine Equipment) Regulations 2017.</p>  <p>  Council Directive 2014/112/EU of 19 December 2014 implementing the European Agreement concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time in inland waterway transport (or the "Organisation of Working Time for Inland Waterways Directive") entered into force on 12/01/2015 with a transposition deadline of 31 December 2016.  </p>  <p>  The Directive aims to lay down more specific working time requirements for mobile transport workers in inland waterway transport (IWT).  Ireland supports Directive 2014/112/EU and believes that it is important to ensure the protection of workers and provide legal certainty for businesses and operators on inland waterways.   </p>  <p>  However, in general terms Ireland is exempt from EU inland waterway Directives as they relate to waterways of a greater size and carrying a greater capacity of goods/passengers than exist in Ireland. Ireland&rsquo;s inland waterways are not navigable for commercial traffic and Ireland does not have any interconnected inland waterway commercial transport for the purposes or on the scale envisaged in EU Directives for this sector.  Ireland keeps a watching brief on matters regarding inland waterways to ensure they do not conflict or overlap with existing legislation.</p></reply>

As such, all estimates remain heavily caveated insofar as the scheme represents a considerable departure from existing schemes and this renders estimates inherently challenging to predict. It is particularly difficult to estimate the behavioural changes that will come by creating drastic increases in the level of subsidy available.</p><p>With regard to the analyses set out below relating to increases to subsidy rates, it should be noted that substantial increases in childcare capacity would be required to meet the likely demand created by increasing the total subsidy payment, particularly at the higher end. </p><p>The existing maximum subsidy rates for a 1-3 year old is &euro;4.35 per hour.

AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the preschool service. </p><p>Under Level 7 of AIM, preschool providers, in partnership with parents, can apply for additional capitation to fund extra support in the preschool room or to enable the reduction of the adult-to-child ratio. Where additional capitation is given to fund extra support in the preschool room, the preschool manager is responsible for recruiting a member of staff to take on this role.</p><p>The Better Start Early Years Specialist Service within Pobal administers AIM Level 7 on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Where there is a delay in recruitment of staff to provide AIM Level 7 support, service providers must complete the &lsquo;Notification of Change&rsquo; form and submit this to Pobal.  </p><p>Pobal has advised that data is available for the 2018/19 and 2019/20 (to date) preschool years on services which have been approved for AIM Level 7 support to support a child or children to access preschool, but who have informed Pobal that they have been unable to recruit suitable staff. Pobal has advised that the total number of preschool services who have notified them that they have been unable to recruit suitable staff to provide AIM Level 7 support is seven over the two years (six in 2018-19 and one to date in 2019-20).</p><p>It is important to note that in the small number of instances where a level 7 support is not available, the child and service provider will still be able to avail of supports under Levels 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 of AIM. </p><p>Children are entitled to two years&rsquo; of free preschool under the ECCE programme. Where a child has availed of AIM Level 7 in their first year of preschool, the preschool provider can submit a second year extension request for the child to avail of AIM Level 7 support in their second year of preschool. </p><p>Pobal data on Level 7 supports is broken down as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2018/2019</th>       <th>2019/2020 (as of 18th October 2019)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total AIM   Level 7 applications approved (including second year   extensions)</td>       <td>3,924</td>       <td>3,464</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total AIM Level   7 applications approved (including second year   extensions) where the preschool   service has notified Pobal it is   unable to recruit suitable staff</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Recruitment of staff has been a significant challenge to many services in recent years. Other than poor terms and conditions which impact retention, this is believed to be mostly due to the major expansion that has occurred in the sector which included a doubling of investment and a doubling of the number of early learning and care and school age childcare places. </p><p>The Pobal Sector Profile data is showing  that, now that capacity has been doubled, the growth rates are levelling off although we expect that the further budgetary increase for 2020 will continue to support further growth in capacity. Turnover of staff has reduced by approx. 3.5% over the last two years. </p><p>A number of factors should begin to see the recruitment difficulties being experienced lessening over time. First 5: A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families (2019-2028), was published in November 2018.  First 5 identifies over 150 actions across the domains that impact on young children&rsquo;s lives, including ambitious and far reaching actions related to the Early Learning and Care (ELC) sector. First 5 commits to at least doubling investment in ELC by 2028 and a key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State will be a new Funding Model.</p><p>The intention with the new Funding Model is to design mechanisms to deliver additional funding to ELC and School Age Childcare providers to ensure greater levels of affordability, quality and inclusion in their services.  It is planned that the new Funding Model will operate in addition to the major funding streams for the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) universal preschool programme and the National Childcare Scheme, when it comes into operation later this year.</p><p>The new Funding Model will be a key vehicle to achieve the vision of ELC services that are equipped to provide high-quality, graduate-led services for children, affordability to parents and sustainability for providers. ELC services that operate in the context of disadvantage will also receive extra support to provide additional services to families.</p><p>Alongside the new Funding Model, work has also begun on a Workforce Development Plan (WDP), which will ensure appropriate levels of Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) staff at all levels in the sector. The Workforce Development Plan will aim to help to address recruitment  difficulties by establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements and associated policy mechanisms. The Workforce Development Plan will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in Early Learning and Care  and School Age Childcare, establishing a career framework and leadership development opportunities and work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.</p><p>The Workforce Development Plan will be carried out in two stages. The first stage will involve preparation of a core report that sets out a high-level vision for the Early Learning and Care (ELC)  and School Age Childcare (SAC) workforce for the period 2020-2028 and a pathway for achieving the commitments set out in First 5: A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families (2019-2028), in relation to development of the ELC and SAC workforce. It will include qualification requirements for different roles in the sector, including ELC, SAC, and childminders. This stage is expected to conclude by mid- 2020. The second stage of the Workforce Development Plan will involve completion of implementation plans by working groups to be specified in Stage 1. Stage two of the plan is expected to be completed by mid-2021.</p></reply>

Following these consultations, the decision was taken to transfer the current ABC Programme to Tusla, from September 2019 as part of the  national Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Programme (PPFS).</p>  <p>  A working group was established in May 2018 to support the transition into this new national structure that can build on the achievements to date in both the ABC and PPFS Programmes, and strengthen Tusla&rsquo;s prevention and early intervention operations. As part of this national structure, it will take a renewed focus on addressing child poverty and inform the delivery of prevention and early intervention initiatives, improving the lives of children and families throughout Ireland. </p>  <p>  The budget agreed for 2020 for the Prevention Programme in Tusla, including funding for the ABC Programme, is &euro;9.5m.

A family unit can accommodate one adult and up to three children.</p><p>The approximate non-capital cost of providing one refuge place in an emergency domestic violence refuge is &euro;100,000 per annum. Based on this figure, the cost of providing an additional 10 refuge places would be &euro;1 million.

This builds on strong existing funding &ndash; including &euro;12.6 million for supports for the community and development sector and &euro;12.5 million in dormant accounts funding for a range of measures.</p>  <p>  There are also small-scale financial grants and supports available through schemes like the Community Enhancement Programme (&euro;4.5 million in 2019), the CL&Aacute;R Programme (&euro;5 million in 2019) and the various supports to local community and voluntary groups and social enterprises. </p>  <p>  &euro;1.2 million is being provided to support the implementation of measures in the &ldquo;Strategy for Community and Voluntary Sector development in Ireland&rdquo;. This will include enhanced supports for the structures which drive local engagement in decision making &ndash; the Public Participation Networks and the Local Community Development Committees. A further &euro;300,000 is being allocated to support delivery of the recently published &ldquo;National Social Enterprise Policy for Ireland&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  I am delighted with the impacts these investments have had and are having in communities, however, I know that there are some groups or community organisations that may not have considered seeking funding because they do not have the experience of submitting funding applications or lack understanding of the criteria in place.</p>  <p>  To help these groups, my Department, in conjunction with Pobal, held a series of six 'Helping Hands' events nationwide earlier this year, to make groups more aware of funding programmes, and to provide practical guidance on making applications. These events provided hints and tips on how to make a better funding application and how to identify local supports that community groups can draw upon.</p>  <p>  I was delighted with the feedback from these events, and I have asked my officials to consider running or participating in similar events into 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department also engaged with local community groups through a series of regional &lsquo;Rural Opportunity' information sessions during between March and May of this year to raise awareness of the extent to which assistance is available  to rural communities from across Government Departments. Staff from my Department and a number of other Departments and agencies were also on hand at the events to provide further information to attendees on the range of supports available.  </p>  <p>  My hope is that these ongoing efforts will encourage individuals and communities to take their own ideas or projects forward to ensure that our funding and supports have the broadest possible reach.</p></reply>

There are a range of supports available to people with long term illness to assist them to enter employment. </p>  <p>  Community employment (CE) and T&uacute;s are work placement schemes that aim to provide quality work opportunities while also assisting in providing certain services of benefit to communities. The Department&rsquo;s main focus is on activation and to progress as many participants as possible from Community Employment and T&uacute;s into full-time and sustainable employment.  These work programmes are available to persons on a qualifying social welfare payment which may include time spent on certain long term illness schemes for example disability allowance, blind pension, illness benefit and invalidity pension.   </p>  <p>  The back to work enterprise scheme assists people on certain social welfare payments including disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance, incapacity supplement, invalidity pension, illness benefit and blind pension who wish to become self-employed.  The back to work enterprise allowance is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are on social welfare payments to develop a business. Individuals in receipt of the back to work enterprise allowance may also receive financial support in the form of the enterprise support grant subject to a maximum amount of &euro;2,500 over the two year period of the back to work enterprise allowance scheme.</p>  <p>  The wages subsidy scheme gives financial support to employers who employ people with disabilities. The objective of the wages subsidy scheme is to increase the likelihood of people with disabilities obtaining and sustaining employment in the open labour market by providing financial incentives to private sector employers.  </p>  <p>  Youth employment support scheme aims to give you the opportunity to learn basic work and social skills in a supportive environment, while on a work placement in a host organisation. The scheme is open to organisations in the private, community and voluntary sectors.

By comparison, the income disregard applied to applicants for Disability Allowance is &euro;120 per week, with 50% of earnings between &euro;120 and &euro;350 disregarded.  For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60 for 3 days and the balance is assessed at 60%.  For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard if &euro;150 with 50% of the balance assessed as means. </p>  <p>  In deliberating measures for Budget 2020 I did include an examination of the disregard for Carer's Allowance.  In its pre-Budget submission, Family Carers Ireland looked for an increase in the disregard for Carer's Allowance of &euro;117.50 for a single person and &euro;235.00 for a couple per week.  My Department costed this proposal using the ESRI SWITCH model.  Allowing for income tax and Working Family Payment offsets, net expenditure is estimated to be approximately &euro;55 million per year.</p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence based perspective.  Some 86% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard. </p>  <p>  Only 0.1% of current Carer's Allowance recipients have means of between &euro;250 and &euro;300 per week, so, it is highly unlikely that any will have their payment reduced as a result of choosing to work additional hours. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

this was the case in 37.6% of such successful outcomes in 2017, 31.5% of such outcomes in 2018 and 37.6 % of such outcomes to the end of September 2019.</p><p>Where the decision was not revised by the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds and, in addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p>Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2012 and 2017 from 39.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2012 to 26.4 weeks in 2017, and from 27.8 weeks for a summary decision in 2012 to 19.8 weeks in 2017.  The corresponding processing times for the year 2018 were 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.8 weeks for a summary decision.  There has been some further improvement in 2019; at the end of September, an oral hearing decision took 27.9 weeks and a summary decision took 23.1 weeks.</p><p>The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with Appeals Officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  It is expected that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.</p><p>In addition, a considerable number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office.</p><p>Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.  If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.</p><p>The statistics required by the Deputy are set out in the tables.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p><p><b>Appeal Receipts and Percentage of Favourable Decisions of Appeals Finalised 2012 &ndash;

A married couple with 2 children could have weekly earnings of &euro;734 net of PRSI, superannuation and union subscription costs and still qualify for the full rate of Carer's Allowance. This is equivalent to over &euro;38,000 per annum. </p>  <p>  At the end of December 2018, there were 79,914 people in receipt of CA.  The projected expenditure on CA in 2019 is almost &euro;840 million.</p>  <p>  The cost to increase the disregard for CA from &euro;332.50 single and &euro;655 for a couple to &euro;450 and &euro;900 respectively using the ESRI SWITCH model.  Allowing for income tax and Working Family Payment offsets, net expenditure is estimated to be around &euro;55 million per year.</p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence based perspective.  Some 86% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard. </p>  <p>  Carers who would benefit from an increased disregard would be in higher income households.  Given the need to target available resources fairly and equitably to those in most need, allowing an increase in the number of hours was the best use of the limited resources available.  In this context I have no plans to change the means conditions for Carer's Allowance at this juncture.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Approval was given for 30 projects under LIHAF in 2017 and these projects will stimulate the development of approximately 20,000 housing units across 14 local authorities. </p><p>Funding of &euro;200 million was originally made available under LIHAF, of which &euro;150 million would be funded by the Exchequer with local authorities to match fund &euro;50 million. 30 projects received final approval, at a total cost of &euro;195.71 million, of which &euro;146.69 million will be funded by the Exchequer with local authorities funding the balance. </p><p>In terms of LIHAF expenditure, most projects have been at the design and planning stages, and this is reflected in the level of expenditure to date. However, projects are now progressing to construction stage and it is expected that the expenditure will increase significantly towards the end of 2019 and into 2020.  Almost &euro;24.5 million has been drawn down to date in relation to LIHAF Project costs by all 14 local authorities granted funding in respect of 28 of the 30 projects.  To date, no local authority has confirmed to my Department that it will not be availing of the funding made available for the project proposals submitted.</p><p>Details on all of the LIHAF projects by local authority area, budget allocation, project description, and housing delivery have been published on the Rebuilding Ireland website and are available at the following link: </p><p>It is not envisaged that LIHAF funding will be reallocated. Additional alternative infrastructure funding mechanisms are now available under my Department since LIHAF was announced.This includes the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) under which a budget of &euro;310 million has been made available to local authorities and the &euro;2 billion funding through the Urban Regeneration Development Fund (URDF).  In addition there is the &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration Development Fund (RRDF) operated by the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p></reply>

Throughout the discussions with the Credit Unions&rsquo; representative bodies, my Department has emphasised that while it can provide technical assistance regarding the mechanisms for funding social housing, which it has provided, it is a matter for the Credit Unions themselves to set up special purpose vehicles to enable them to invest in the sector. For this reason, my Department referred the Credit Unions&rsquo; representative bodies to the Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) with a view to both sectors sharing, as far as practical, the benefits of their respective work in this area, including the work being undertaken by the ICSH on the development of special purpose vehicles for social housing financing purposes, supported by grant funding from my Department.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter for both parties to progress these engagements, which I hope can lead to a workable, mutually acceptable approach to moving forward on this issue.</p></reply>

The Wildlife Acts afford protection to a range of habitats and species and provide for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity, such as hunting and trade. </p>  <p>  The legislative framework in place to protect biodiversity is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 SI No 477/2011, which also fall under the remit of my Department. These Regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union, giving a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State. The main instruments provided for are the designation of Special Protection Areas (SPA), aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds, and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats. </p>  <p>  My Department is also responsible for developing and publishing Ireland's National Biodiversity Action Plan. To further the implementation of the Plan, and to mainstream biodiversity within national policy, an interdepartmental Biodiversity Working Group was established in 2012, drawn from 18 Government Departments and Agencies. Members have responsibilities for sectors where activities can have a direct impact on biodiversity or where there are opportunities for changes in the management of environmental resources that can support biodiversity policy formation. These sectors include strategic and land use planning, agriculture and forestry, marine and freshwater fisheries, the management and monitoring of water and environmental quality, and the provision of transport and energy infrastructure. In addition, there are Government Departments or Agencies with responsibility for sectors where there are opportunities for synergies between biodiversity protection and community development, education or health.</p>  <p>  The National Biodiversity Data Centre (NBDC) is the name given to a programme established by the Heritage Council in 2006. It addresses the need identified by the Council that data on Ireland&rsquo;s biodiversity be collected recorded and fully accessible to the public. The programme has been operated under two publically tendered contracts entered into between the Council and Compass Informatics - a private company. The team working on biodiversity data collection are employees of Compass Informatics a wholly owned subsidiary of Tracsis plc. The Heritage Council is currently finalising a contract extension with Compass Informatics to collect biodiversity data into 2020. Concurrently, a review is being undertaken by the Council. This is examining the governance, operating and financial models underpinning this important work. The outcome of that review will inform the next request for tender. Like all public contracts, this work is subject to public procurement rules. The Heritage Council&rsquo;s contract with Compass Informatics has been very important in the collection of biodiversity data for public policymaking and decision making.</p></reply>

Our 6 National Parks account for circa 65,000 hectares with another almost 22,000 hectares of nature reserves and other heritage sites. The existing National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, and attract in excess of 4 million visitors annually.</p>  <p>  Given the resources available for capital investment within our National Parks and Nature Reserves, I am ever mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves lands and have no plans at present to increase the number of National Parks in the country.</p>  <p>  However, as part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and improving our tourism and recreation product, we have been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives.</p>  <p>  In this context, it should be noted that in late 2016 my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of &euro;800,000. The purchase underpins the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to the preservation of our natural heritage for future generations of citizens and visitors alike to enjoy.</p>  <p>  In 2017 the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This creates a State &ndash; Owned wilderness project of over 11,000 hectares and aims to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as  enhanced recreational and social benefits through the &lsquo;re-wilding&rsquo; of the forest which adjoins the National Park. Thanks to the acquisition, we will be returning the area to a natural wilderness state.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, launched a strategic partnership in 2017 with a view to growing tourism revenues in the rural areas where the parks are located and increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a recreation destination.  One of the outputs from the partnership with F&aacute;ilte was &ldquo;Experiencing the Wild Heart of Ireland&rdquo;; an interpretative masterplan for the development of our National Parks and Reserves, which was published last year and sets out a road map for investment at these important nature conservation, public amenity and tourism sites and underpins the objectives of Project 2040. </p>  <p>  The investment in our National Parks will create memorable and meaningful experiences of Ireland&rsquo;s landscapes, wildlife and culture. This will be done though sensitive design and the development of authentic experiences, providing better access to nature and an increased understanding of society&rsquo;s conservation responsibilities, as well as supporting significant investment in recreational facilities including upgrading and development of the trails network,increased visitor facilities and improved signage and branding. These will be designed and delivered with a strong emphasis on conservation and allow us protect and preserve our most fragile environments and investing in our culture, language &amp;amp; heritage provide a well-being benefit for all.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a provision of some &euro;5million in funding, for 32 individual projects across the network of NPWS sites, was announced earlier this year as part of the Rural Regeneration Development Fund.  So while I have no plans to expand the Park network at present, my Department is actively ensuring the preservation, protection and presentation of the assets we already own.</p></reply>
