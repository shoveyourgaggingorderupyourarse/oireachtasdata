This strategy was driven by the need to develop a clear direction for the future of the Civil Service, while also responding to today&rsquo;s challenging environment.</p><p>The strategy provides a ten-year framework focused on three core themes</p><p>- Delivering evidence-informed policy and services</p><p>- Harnessing digital technology and innovation, and</p><p>- Building the Civil Service workforce, workplace and organisation of the future</p><p>The Civil Service Renewal 2024 Action Plan, which I launched in December, is the first in a series of three-year action plans supporting the delivery of the ten-year strategy. The Plan mirrors the themes of the Strategy and sets out the expected outcomes to be delivered in the next three years, details of the specific actions required and how the plan will be governed and managed. The action plan is ambitious, containing 77 actions for implementation by the end of 2024.</p><p>As we have seen during the pandemic, the Civil Service responded with innovation and agility to ensure the ongoing delivery of important public services, allowing Government Departments and Offices to continue to discharge their functions. </p><p>As our country emerges from the pandemic we must ensure that the Civil Service has the capability, agility and foresight to respond accordingly. Civil Service Renewal 2024 will build on the experience gained in responding to the pandemic and learn the lessons for the future to secure long-lasting change and improve our service delivery. My officials will lead on the delivery of the priorities identified in the Plan and work through the existing governance structures to ensure a cohesive and collaborative approach is taken in its implementation. </p></reply>

They have faced difficult challenges and have risen to the task. </p><p>As a Government, we have, on many occasions, stated our commitment to recognise these efforts. There were a number of issues which needed to be taken in to consideration before we could finalise our proposals, and the pandemic has remained an ongoing challenge for us all, requiring our full focus and attention. </p><p>We have given detailed consideration to these matters and yesterday the Cabinet approved a package of measures to recognise these efforts and to pay tribute to those who have lost their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>Working together has been a key element of the Government&rsquo;s approach to the pandemic to date, and this is reflected in the approach announced yesterday. In particular, the value of the contribution of our healthcare workers on the front line cannot be overstated. </p><p>The measures we will introduce are:</p><p>- A Public Holiday which will be held on 18<sup>th</sup>March 2022 in recognition of the efforts of the general public and Ireland&rsquo;s frontline workers during the Covid-19 pandemic and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>- A new annual public holiday from 2023 in celebration of Imbolc/St. Brigid&rsquo;s day, which will be the first Monday in every February;</p><p>- A tax free recognition payment of &euro;1,000 for:</p><p>- Public service health and ambulance workers who were working onsite in Covid-19 exposed environments;</p><p>- Those seconded or assigned to the HSE (for example our Defence Forces staff who were assigned to HSE testing centres);</p><p>- Students who were required to perform training in clinical sites; and</p><p>- Staff working onsite in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19. </p><p>In deciding on these measures, and to whom the payment would apply, the Government carefully considered a number of matters, including the consideration that we have a national pay agreement in place for the public service &ndash; with associated pay increases of up to 3% over the period January 2021 to December 2022.</p><p>I would like to thank both Unions and Employer representatives for the leadership they have shown throughout the pandemic and for their engagement on this matter.  They have played a key role in the collective national effort that has been undertaken and is ongoing. </p><p>The effort of employees, their representatives and employers has been hugely important in our national response to covid. The public holiday which we have announced is in recognition of their tremendous efforts.  In particular we all know that the health services have borne the brunt of this pandemic, and I believe that it is right to knowledge this.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-20a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012000073#WRA01400"><p>Thank You, Deputy Crowe, for your question in relation to the upcoming programme of works in Clare. Your query covers a range of projects from minor works to large capital programmes and drainage maintenance. The OPW have invested heavily in Flood Relief projects in County Clare over the last number of years and continue to do so with a cumulative value for active schemes in excess of 70 million euro.</p><p>In respect of drainage maintenance:  The Office of Public Works (OPW) has a statutory duty for the maintenance of completed arterial drainage schemes and certain completed flood relief schemes under the 1945 and 1995 Arterial Drainage Acts.  Some 2,100km of channel and some 135km of embankments are maintained annually.  The OPW Annual Maintenance Programme for 2022 includes maintenance in County Clare on the Shannon Embankments (North) Schemes and the Creegh Scheme.</p><p>In respect of Capital Flood Relief Schemes:  Currently there are five major schemes and two small schemes been progressed in County Clare.</p><p>Of the major schemes:</p><p><b>Ennis Lower</b></p><p>Ennis Lower Flood Relief Scheme is now substantially complete. The last of the works of this scheme at Bank Place in Ennis was completed in 2021. Apart from some minor snagging there are no works planned or required at this location for 2022. </p><p><b>Ennis south</b></p><p>Ennis South Flood Relief Scheme is substantially complete with only some small items to be completed.  It is expected that this minor snagging and landscaping will be completed early 2022. Once this has concluded, Clare County Council will then be in a position to complete the remaining work on the Riverside walk.</p><p><b>Kilkee Flood Relief </b></p><p>The proposed Kilkee Flood Relief Scheme is currently at Stage 1: Scheme Development and Preliminary design.  Engineering and environmental consultants were appointed in December 2019. Since this time the consultants have commissioned and completed most of the baseline surveys, including topographic, Site investigation and environmental and ecological surveys. The consultants are currently finalising the survey work and processing the data. The consultants are now focused on progressing the Initial Options Assessment for Kilkee.  It is expected that the scheme will be submitted for Planning in early 2023.</p><p><b>Shannon Town &amp;amp; Airport Flood Relief Scheme</b></p><p>The proposed Shannon Flood Relief Scheme is currently at<i></i>stage 1: Scheme Development and Preliminary design. Since the appointment of engineering and environmental consultants for the project in 2020 the group has been working to ensure that the development of the scheme is based on the most accurate and up to date information.  To this end the consultants have been carrying out survey works such as Topographical Surveys, Ground Investigation and CCTV surveys. This survey work, along with Hydraulic Analysis, Environmental Assessment and scheme Analysis and Development, will continue throughout 2022. </p><p><b>Springfield Flood Relief Scheme</b></p><p>The Main works are currently suspended on the scheme over the winter period due to unfavourable weather and ground conditions. In the interim, Clare County Council have appointed Contractors to carry out ground water monitoring and two site visits have been carried out.  Clare County Council will shortly appoint another contractor to carry out further geophysical surveys at the location to inform completion of the scheme.  Subject to suitable weather and ground conditions, it is anticipated that the site will open this spring and works should largely be completed this year. </p><p><b>The two small schemes of Bunratty and Kilrush are currently been progressed.</b></p><p>Further analysis of the proposed Bunratty scheme is required. Clare County Council in cooperation with the OPW are progressing this element. </p><p>A consultant&rsquo;s brief is currently being prepared for Kilrush with a view to appoint consultants in 2022.</p><p><b>Minor Works</b></p><p>The following is an update on the Minor works schemes either commencing, underway or recently completed in County Clare: </p><p><b>On the Cloughaninchy Flood Relief Project:</b></p><p>Clare County Council are finalising remaining land agreements. Subject to funding; Detailed Design and procurement of contractor for works is scheduled for 2022.</p><p><b>On the Milltown Malbay Flood Relief Project:</b></p><p>Negotiations between Clare County Council and a key landowner are ongoing. This element of the works will need to be concluded before the scheme can progress.</p><p><b>The Spanish Point Minor Coastal Protection Scheme is </b>Substantially complete.</p><p><b>On the Thomond Villas Flood Relief Project:</b></p><p><b>Clare County council </b>intend to submit to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning in 2022.</p><p><b>The Kilbaha Erosion Protection project Is at </b>study finalisation.</p><p><b>On the Whitestrand Coastal Protection Scheme</b></p><p>The preliminary design has now been completed. Subject to funding, it is Clare County Council&rsquo;s intention to submit for planning in 2022.</p><p><b>And finally, on the Quin Flood Relief Works:</b></p><p>Clare County Council hope to<b></b>submit for Part 8 Planning imminently and commence construction of scheme this year.</p></reply>

On an ongoing basis the OPW Maintenance Helpdesk provides advice and assistance on request to Departments occupying OPW buildings.  Responsibility for risk assessing individual work places, including the level of ventilation in OPW buildings, rests with the occupying Department. In buildings where the OPW manages the maintenance of ventilation systems, this is done in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations and guidelines. Control settings, such as extended run times (before and after building occupation) have been changed in line with the latest public health recommendations.  In circumstances where a concern or issue relating to poor ventilation in an area is raised by an occupying Department, these are addressed on a case by case basis by OPW Engineers/Technical Inspectors.  </p><p>The OPW is funded to carry out essential maintenance of Civil Service occupied buildings.  This maintenance includes ventilation systems.  Government Departments are funded to carry out elective works and OPW will advise/manage where requested to do so.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-20a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012000073#WRA02100"><p>In November 2021, the Public Sector Cyber Security Baseline Standard was published by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  This was a commitment in the National Cyber Security Strategy 2019-2024 and sets out a range of guidance for civil and public service bodies as they continue to work to mitigate the risk of cyber crime and improve resilience of their ICT and digital systems.  The Cyber Security Baseline Standards Framework will be used by Public Service Bodies to assess and improve the management of cybersecurity and will allow them to identify, protect, detect, respond to, and recover from an attack, minimising damage and impact.  I am happy to advise that the measures in place in my own Department already meets the baseline standard.</p>  <p>  It is critical that the State continues to upgrade and improve the resilience of the State&rsquo;s IT systems across both public and private sectors.  This is a global issue and the European Union has put in place specific EU-wide legislation, the Network and Information Security (NIS) directive,  to ensure that critical IT systems are subject to a higher standard of cyber-security.  Updated legislation is currently being drafted by my colleague Minister Ryan whose Department is responsible for the transposition of the NIS2 Directive in to national law.  This new legislation is needed in order to strengthen the security requirements and expand the list of systems and industries that fall under its scope.  For the first time this legislation will cover critical public administration activities carried out by the public sector. </p></reply>

The Visitor Centre was officially opened in April 1994.</p><p>The Visitor Centre site on the mainland at D&uacute;n Chaoin supports and animates the OPW&rsquo;s operations on the Great Blasket Island. </p><p>To enhance the visitor offering on the mainland, in 2020 we constructed a striking Viewing Platform on a clifftop site overlooking the Blasket Sound, which I had the pleasure of opening in July 2020.</p><p>A major project is currently underway to refurbish Ionad an Bhlascaoid and install a reimagined exhibition which will deliver a world-class visitor attraction in D&uacute;n Chaoin. This project is at an advanced stage and is due for completion in Spring 2022. It is expected to be transformative for tourism in the locality. </p><p>The Viewing Platform and the upgrades to the Visitor Centre are part of a major programme of investment of circa &euro;2.6m in the Blaskets by the strategic partnership of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the OPW and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p><p>Since the inception of Ionad an Bhlascaoid at Dun Chaoin, the OPW has been highly engaged with the local community and Fond&uacute;ireacht an Bhlascaoid in seeking to meet the cultural and social needs of the community.</p><p>The OPW&rsquo;s role is to preserve and animate our national archaeological, natural and cultural heritage through compelling visitor experiences. The lands at Ionad an Bhlascaoid were acquired for the construction of the Ionad and are maintained by the State for the purpose of conserving and presenting the unique natural, literary and cultural legacy of the Blasket Islands.</p><p><b>Playground Development</b></p><p>In the latter part of 2020, the OPW was approached by Comharchumann Dh&uacute;n Chaoin regarding the possibility of the OPW providing lands at the site of Ionad an Bhlascaoid for the purposes of a community playground.</p><p>The OPW management team assessed the proposal holistically and considered multiple issues about capacity, best practices in heritage presentation and the long-term objectives of the site. It was decided that any solution must address these concerns while meeting the needs of the local community. </p><p>Last September I had a really positive meeting with the Comharchumann, at which the OPW made an offer in principle of a site to be leased for a playground for the community in D&uacute;n Chaoin.</p><p>A location adjacent to the Ionad on OPW lands, but not on the immediate footprint of the Ionad site, has been provisionally identified. I can confirm that the site has been assessed by both Comharchumann Dhun Chaoin and Kerry County Council, and I was assured that this site is acceptable to both.</p><p>Following the offer in principle of a lease on the relevant lands, the Comharchumann is engaging now with Kerry County Council to secure their support and assistance in the design and development of the playground facility. The next step is for a detailed proposal for design and layout of the playground to be developed and agreed with all stakeholders. Thereafter, this proposal must be submitted for planning permission through the normal process. </p><p>Any lease for the purposes of a playground will be entered into when planning permission is secured.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-20a.30.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012000074#WRB00400"><p>The Office of Public Works has been actively progressing the various elements of the Phoenix Park Transport and Mobility Options Study, Post Consultation Report, June 2021, since its adoption by my Office. Over 2,200 submissions were received from members of the public, stakeholders and elected representatives. Five common themes emerged as follows: - walking &amp;amp; cycling; access, gates &amp;amp; roads; public transport; movement within the park and public consultation. The recommendations contained within the report were to be advanced in three phases, over the next seven years. With regard to Phase 1 (years 0-2), the following proposals have been activated by my department as set out within the report.</p>  <p>  A programme of improvements to walking and cycling infrastructure commenced in 2021 with the instillation of over 2.5km of re-laid footpaths along the North road which greatly improved the quality and alignment of the footpath surface. Dropped kerbs were installed at strategic points along the route to ensure universal access for all.  A series of small local footpath upgrades have also taken place. </p>  <p>  The design and plans for the 4.5km permanent one directional cycle lanes along Chesterfield Avenue, linking Castleknock to the city, are currently being developed with the National Transport Authority &amp;amp; Dublin City Council. In the interim, the tender has been awarded for the supply and installation of traffic lane separators for the entire length of Chesterfield Avenue, on both sides of the road. Works on site are due to commence in February 2022.  Over 8km of temporary cones will be removed and these new durable and strong dividers will ensure a safer experience for both cyclists and vehicles using Chesterfield Avenue. In addition, over 40 new bike stands have been installed throughout the Park with an additional 70 planned for 2022.</p>  <p>  The OPW is currently preparing a 3-year programme of pedestrian and cycle improvements including provision of bike parking infrastructure throughout the Park.</p>  <p>  Further to the recommendations in the Transport and Mobility Options Report, the implementation of the 9-month pilot study of cul-de-sacs on the North Road &amp;amp; Upper Glen Road will commence on Monday 28 February 2022. The North Road will be temporarily closed from 21 February to facilitate enabling works including the instillation of bollards, new road markings, signage etc and will reopen on 28 February as a one-way system, in the City direction only. Likewise, on the Upper Glen Road, enabling works will commence from February 21 to facilitate the installation of bollards, signage and line marking in advance of the pilot cul-de-sacs commencing on the 28 February 2022. Access will not be impacted to those institutions in close proximity to these pilot studies routes.</p>  <p>  Traffic data collection points were installed throughout the Phoenix Park in late 2021 and will record vehicular and cycle data over the next 6 months.</p>  <p>  Under the theme 'Movement within the Park', the OPW and An Garda Siochana have been actively refining plans for the introduction of a 30kmph speed limit in the Park from 28 February 2022.  A robust operations and communications plan will be put in place in advance of the reduction of speed limit from 50kph to 30kph. This measure should see a marked difference in driver behaviour making the Park a safer place for those using it for recreational purposes. An Garda Siochana will monitor compliance with the new speed limit and will take appropriate action when necessary.</p>  <p>  Long-stay commuter parking, as well as high levels of illegal parking within and around the perimeter of the Park were identified as a major issue in the Study. As a result. one of the key recommendations of the Study was the development of a Parking Strategy to examine ways in which we can address parking demand and traffic volumes at key attractions such as the Phoenix Park Visitor Centre and Dublin Zoo, but also promote the switch to sustainable modes of travel to access the Park, which is a key aspiration of the Transport and Mobility Options Study.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the Parking Strategy will primarily be focused on measures related to visitor parking including bike parking, and in light of the aims and objectives of the Transport and Mobility Options Study, emphasis will be on providing for those visitors who have no other option than to use a car to visit the Park. The Strategy will also address the needs of those with mobility issues and their parking requirements. The Strategy will however, also be required to address issues such as long stay commuter parking and illegal parking within the Park.</p>  <p>  Given that recommendations for the Phoenix Park could impact the surrounding areas and communities, a secondary study area encompassing residential areas surrounding the Park will also be considered when assessing the impacts of proposed options that might be developed as part of the overall Parking Strategy for the Park.</p>  <p>  I can also advise that the National Transport Authority is currently trialling bus options for the Park and they do hope to have recommendations in early 2022 for the best options available to serve the Phoenix Park and surrounding areas. </p>  <p>  The OPW has initiated a review of the legislation pertaining to the bye-laws of the Phoenix Park with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and other relevant Government departments, with regard to the regulation of traffic and parking within the Phoenix Park.</p>  <p>  I&rsquo;d like to emphasise that I personally have met with the relevant public representatives on a number of occasions at key stages in the process over the last eighteen months with a view to listening and understanding the concerns of constituents with regard to transport and mobility issues in, and around the Park. My officials have also made detailed presentations to Local Area Committees of both Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council to brief local Councillors on the details of the report as it went to consultation. They also met them again last October to brief them on the recommendations for implementation contained in the final report produced following the public consultation process. </p>  <p>  A detailed communications plan is currently being finalised to provide the public with notice of the proposed changes to speed limit within the Park along with the commencement of pilot studies on 28th February. This will include provision of signage throughout the Park, messaging through digital and traditional communications platform along with direct engagement with internal and external park stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The OPW is committed to continuing engagement with the public on all of these issues and assures all stakeholders that the conservation and presentation of the Phoenix Park to international best practice while accommodating access for all is paramount.</p></reply>

This funding has been critical in supporting our people and businesses impacted by the pandemic and in providing the necessary funding to allow our key public services respond effectively to the crisis. Some &euro;30 billion in additional funding was made available to Departments across 2020 and 2021 for measures related to Covid-19 with provision for up to &euro;7 billion made under Budget 2022. This funding has supported the delivery of key public services while addressing the challenges of Covid-19 and has provided for critical income and employment supports to our workers and businesses, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). </p>  <p>  Key measures have been extended as necessary since the beginning of the pandemic in order to continue essential support, most recently in response to the impact of the Omicron wave where a number of further measures were agreed by Government including for the EWSS and PUP schemes and measures for particularly impacted sectors.  </p>  <p>  The careful phased withdrawal of Covid-19 supports is essential both to support society and the economy to recover from the impact of Covid-19, and to return our public finances to a sustainable position. In this context, with the phased withdrawal of supports, it will be important to target measures at those sectors of the economy most affected by the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Of the &euro;7 billion available for Covid-19 related measures in 2022, &euro;3.1 billion has already been allocated to Departments, including for projects funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, while &euro;3.9 billion remains held in reserve. This contingency reserve provides Government with the flexibility to respond to the pandemic during 2022 and will be allocated as needed during the year to specific expenditure measures that can be most effective at that particular time. </p></reply>

Section 5 of the National Monuments Act (1930) allows owners of other national monuments to appoint the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage or the relevant local authority as guardian of such monuments, subject to their consent. This means in effect that while the property of such a monument remains vested in the owner, its maintenance and upkeep are the responsibility of the State. Glendruid Dolmen is one such monument and it came into State Guardianship in 1931. The then-owner reserved the right to restrict public access to the monument. This remains the position of the current owner today.  There is, however, a recognised right-of-way for the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland to access the site for the purpose of maintenance.  OPW is committed to its role in the protection, preservation and conservation of all National Monuments in State care, including Glendruid Dolmen in line with its legislative obligation.  The OPW has no role in the provision of public access in this instance. Unfortunately, public access cannot be facilitated where a public right-of way is not in place. </p></reply>

While it is a historic landscape of international significance enjoyed by millions of people on a yearly basis, it is also home to a number of important institutions including St Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, Garda Headquarters and Aras an Uachtarain, all of which require 24 hour access. Further, it occupies a strategic position within the greater Dublin area, as the main road of the Park, Chesterfield Avenue, is a major artery linking the Castleknock/Blanchardstown area to the city, which is also regularly utilised by emergency services over the 24 hour period. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Irish National War Memorial Gardens (INWMG) and the Irish Museum of Modern Art (Royal Hospital, Kilmainham) (IMMA), these parks and gardens are solely utilised for recreational, commemorative and cultural purposes with no requirement for 24-hour access. </p>  <p>  The Irish National War Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge occupy an area of about eight hectares on the southern banks of the River Liffey, almost opposite the Magazine Fort in the Phoenix Park and approximately three kilometres from the centre of Dublin. The gardens commemorate the 49,400 soldiers who lost their lives in the WWI and some 450,000 people visit these exquisite and tranquil gardens on an annual basis.</p>  <p>  Works on the iconic Royal Hospital commenced in 1680 to accommodate &lsquo;the aged and maimed officers and soldiers&rsquo; from the Irish armies and was largely completed and occupied by 1687. The baroque gardens and surrounding grounds have been recreated to offer the public opportunities to appreciate culture, biodiversity and designed landscapes, while providing the setting for the Royal Hospital.</p>  <p>  Both the INWMG and IMMA are culturally sensitive locations with historic buildings and fragile landscapes, which are enjoyed by nearly one million recreational visitors on an annual basis, during daylight hours. It is important to note that similar locations throughout Ireland managed by Local Authorities such as Malahide Castle grounds, closes every evening from 4pm to 9pm depending on the season. Likewise areas within the Phoenix Park such as the Peoples Gardens operate similar opening hours to Malahide Castle, INWMG and IMMA.</p>  <p>  While the grounds of the INWMG are open via a right of way along the Liffey, the park gates are open  from Monday to Saturday from 7.30am to 4pm/ 9pm depending on the season and from 9.30am on Sundays.</p>  <p>  The grounds of IMMA are open to the public, Monday to Saturday from 8.00am to 6.30pm and on Sundays from 11.00am. They are closed on Good Friday and 24 December to 26 December.</p>  <p>  The opening and closing times for both the INWMG and IMMA should not be considered in the same light as the Phoenix Park, given their distinct differences in scale and functions. Further, both INWMG and IMMA were designed to be utilised during daylight hours and would pose a serious risks to the public&rsquo;s safety should they be opened during the hours of darkness. In addition, neither park has sufficient public lighting nor staff in order to maintain the appropriate levels of security that would be required to protect the public, monuments and buildings etc.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the OPW has no plans to alter the general opening times of the Irish National War Memorial Gardens or the grounds of the Irish Museum of Modern Art at present, but will keep the opening times under review. </p></reply>

The responsibility for the management and delivery of the individual investment projects, within the allocations agreed under the National Development Plan (NDP), rests with the individual sponsoring Department in each case. My Department therefore allocates expenditure on a departmental basis, not a geographic basis. </p>  <p>  The NDP includes indicative Exchequer allocations for each Department for a five year period (2021 to 2025) and overall capital expenditure ceilings out to 2030. This expenditure is aimed at supporting the delivery of the ten National Strategic Outcomes (NSOs) identified in the National Planning Framework (NPF), which sets the overarching spatial strategy for the next two decades.  </p>  <p>  As the NDP is a high-level financial and budgetary framework it does not outline a comprehensive list of all the public investment projects that will take place over the next ten years. For an extensive list of projects that are currently planned as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Deputy might consider the publications that were published alongside the NDP in October 2021, particularly the updated Investment tracker. The tracker provides a composite update on the progress of all major investments with an estimated cost of greater than &euro;20 million, including the location of the projects where possible.  The tracker includes a number of major projects directly related to Cork. The tracker also includes a facility to search by county and user-friendly dashboards and other information to aid interpretation of the data.</p>  <p>  Accompanying the tracker, the myProjectIreland interactive map includes over 900 projects across the country and provides details on specific projects by county, including smaller investments such as schools and social housing projects. By clicking on the map on gov.ie/2040, citizens will find updated information on what has been achieved and what is planned for their own local area.  The latest version of the map features a dashboard with charts, allowing citizens to see the progress being made on projects at a glance.  Search facilities also allow citizens to view projects in their regional area, by city, by county or by eircode.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Regional Reports on the implementation of Project Ireland 2040 in the Southern Region have been published for 2018, 2019 and 2020.  The reports set out the regional projects and programmes, which are being planned and delivered in the Southern Region as part of the public investment detailed in Project Ireland 2040, the Government&rsquo;s National Planning Framework and National Development Plan.  While this document does not provide an exhaustive list of all public capital expenditure in the region, it does serve to highlight the diverse range of investments being made by the State under Project Ireland 2040, including in County Cork.</p>  <p>  The Project Ireland 2040 Regional Reports, capital investment tracker and myProjectIreland interactive map are all available on gov.ie/2040.</p></reply>

The NPPPF supports and enables public bodies to adopt procedures to meet their public procurement requirements and facilitates compliance with EU and National Procurement Rules. </p>  <p>  The Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services (Guidelines) are published on the OGP website (www.ogp.gov.ie) and reviewed periodically to take account of new developments in the area of procurement, the nature of queries to OGP and to clarify aspects which arise.  My officials are currently finalising a review of the Guidelines which were published in 2019.  An updated version will be published in the first quarter of 2022, incorporating changes that have occurred in the procurement landscape over the last two years.   A new section of the Guidelines will focus on Strategic Procurement reflecting the emphasis on leveraging public procurement to yield wider societal benefits.  The Office of Government Procurement provides updates and guidance for public procurement practitioners on specific issues from time to time.  For example, an updated Brexit Information Note was published in July 2021 and updated COVID Information Note was published in September 2021.  </p>  <p>  While the Guidelines facilitate and enable compliance with public procurement rules, it is the responsibility of each Contracting Authority to ensure they adhere to these rules.</p></reply>

Supports were introduced swiftly in 2020, with a range of schemes introduced to support incomes, employment and key public services. Over &euro;16&frac12; billion in funding was made available for measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic during 2020, which provided for essential economic and societal supports. This provided additional funding to support our health service in responding to the impact of the pandemic; to support the operation of public transport; and support the reopening of the Education sector. These measures included income and employment support schemes such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), along with a range of other business supports such as liquidity supports, restart grants and the commercial rates waivers. </p>  <p>  During 2021, as Covid-19 continued to impact, key schemes and supports were extended.  In addition to the measures provided for by allocations made to Departments in the Revised Estimates for Covid-19 related measures, the funding held in reserve under Budget 2021 was allocated during the year to provide for measures such as the further extension of the PUP and EWSS schemes, additional supports for businesses and particularly impacted sectors such as live entertainment. Across the year, provision of almost &euro;13&frac12; billion was made for Covid-19 related measures. </p>  <p>  For 2022, &euro;3.1 billion in funding to address the impacts of Covid-19 has already been allocated at Departmental level in the 2022 Revised Estimates, including &euro;0.2 billion for projects funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan. A further &euro;3.9 billion remains held in reserve, to be allocated if required during the year for targeted measures to address the continued challenges caused by the pandemic. Within this, specific amounts have been earmarked for the Education and Health sectors and for labour market impacts. The contingency funding will be used to support our economy and society over the coming year and will be allocated to specific expenditure measures that can be most effective at that particular time. </p></reply>

This will have a considerable impact on flood risk in Ireland, particularly where our cities and most of our main towns are located either on the coast or alongside our estuaries or rivers.  Following on from the review of national flood policy, launched in 2018, the OPW Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMPs) are a roadmap for flood risk management measures that, in conjunction with flood risk schemes already constructed, will provide protection to approximately 95% of properties assessed to be at significant flood risk.  </p><p>Building on the FRMPs, the OPW has published a Climate Change Sectoral Adaptation Plan for Flood Risk Management 2019 - 2024, in line with the requirements of the <i>National Adaptation Framework</i>and the <i>Climate Action Plan 2019</i>.  The Sectoral Plan approved by Government in October 2019 includes twenty-one actions that are being implemented during this Strategy to meet the objectives of ongoing research and assessment, adapting our flood risk management practice across Government to effectively manage the potential impacts of climate change on future flood risk.  </p><p>An  Interdepartmental Group to develop a national co-ordinated and integrated coastal change strategy has been established by the Government.  It will identify measures to be considered for managing the projected impact of coastal change to our coastal communities, economies, heritage, culture and environment and will set out options and recommendations for the Government to consider.  The OPW is jointly chairing the Interdepartmental Group with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Inter-Departmental Group is advancing the drafting and finalising of its report which will be presented to Government for their consideration. </p></reply>

This project is one of seven priority action points arising from the building innovation report, which drew upon an extensive consultation and international benchmarking process and an economic analysis of the causes of productivity trends in the construction sector.

Maintenance of Arterial and Drainage District channels, designated under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, is the responsibility of the OPW and Local Authorities respectively. These include the maintenance by the OPW of the Boyne, Inny and Glyde-and-Dee Arterial Drainage Schemes in County Cavan. Parts of the Erne Catchment are a Drainage District for which the Local Authority is responsible for ongoing maintenance.</p><p>In 1995, due to increased urban flooding, the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 was amended to facilitate the OPW&rsquo;s implementation of localised flood relief schemes to provide flood protection to cities, towns and villages.</p><p>The launch of the Flood Risk Management Plans in May 2018, following the largest ever study of flood risk in Ireland, identified that Government investment is feasible to protect 95 percent of properties at assessed risk from significant flooding through flood relief schemes. The Plans included a flood relief scheme for Cavan Town and this is currently being developed by Cavan County Council with funding from the OPW. The tender deadline for Consultant Engineers on the project was 29 October 2021. Tender submissions have been assessed with a view to the appointment of a successful tenderer in the coming weeks.  <i></i></p><p>The OPW has no plans for further catchment-wide arterial drainage schemes. However, to target the management of flood risk outside of cities, towns and villages, in 2009 the OPW introduced the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme. The purpose of this Scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The OPW approved funding of &euro;75,600 to Cavan County Council in 2020 for 6 projects at Aghadreenagh, Redhills; Ballyhaise, Cavan Road; Drumliff, Ballyhaise; Knockateery, Cloverhills; Ballyhaise Pitch &amp;amp; Mullinavanague, Redhills.</p></reply>

The Office of Public Works (OPW) does not have responsibility for the preparation of a national coastal erosion strategy or plan. The OPWs prime responsibility in this area is the management of flood risk. However, the Government has established an Inter-Departmental Group on Managing Coastal Change to scope out an approach for the development of a national co-ordinated and integrated strategy to manage the projected impact of coastal change to our coastal communities, economies, heritage, culture and environment.  The Inter-Departmental Group is jointly chaired by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the OPW and will bring forward options and recommendations for the Government to consider.</p><p>Coastal protection and localised flooding issues are matters, in the first instance, for each local authority to investigate and address.  To assist Local Authorities in managing the coastline for coastal erosion, the OPW has undertaken a national assessment of coastal erosion (including erosion rates) under the Irish Coastal Protection Strategy Study (ICPSS) and the results of this study have been published on the OPW website. This data enables Local Authorities to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties.  </p><p>The Local Authorities may carry out coastal protection works using their own resources. If necessary, they may also put forward proposals to the relevant Government Departments for funding of appropriate measures. Intervention or hard defences has the potential to cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal risk management study that has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options. </p><p>The OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme since 2009, under which applications for funding from local authorities for small localised works are considered for measures costing up to &euro;750,000 in each instance. Funding for coastal risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme. The OPW guidelines for funding applications under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, together with a full list of funding approvals since 2009 is available on the OPW website at www.gov.ie/opw</p><p>The OPW has approved &euro;1.2m for coastal protection works, including coastal erosion, to Clare County Council since 2009. A summary of these approvals is attached.</p><p>Extensive storm damage has been caused in recent years to sections of the existing coastline and coastal defence within the area known as Liscannor Bay from Clahane to Crag Beach. </p><p>In 2015, Clare County Council received approval from the OPW to undertake a number of Studies in the Liscannor Area, including Clahane under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme.  The Council commissioned a report. The study investigates existing and future coastal damage and its causes and proposes appropriate plans to best manage the risks identified. The four individual areas put forward by Clare County Council for assessment as part of the study were Clahane, Liscannor Bay, The Glebe and Lahinch. Clare County Council added a fifth area, Crag Beach, to the study in the early stages. The total study area spans an approximate length of 4.4km of coastline along Liscannor Bay.</p><p>The study report provides an estimate of the cost of the Clahane scheme at circa &euro;1.23m (2016 rates, excl. VAT) and a Benefit Cost ratio ranging from 1.25 to 1.4. Therefore while<i></i>theoretically there is a feasible scheme with a positive BCR of 1.25 to 1.4 and an estimated cost of &euro;1.23M (2016 rates, exclusive of VAT), the outcome of this report means that progression of this scheme would lie outside the criterion of the Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme. </p><p>A meeting was held in November 2021 between the Office of Public Works and Clare County Council to discuss how a scheme could be progressed. It was agreed that as a first step, the County Council would bring the 2016 figures up to date and submit updated cost and costs estimate/ratio to 2021 rates.  Following receipt of this information, the decision can be taken regarding how a viable scheme could be developed. </p></reply>

Transposition of the EU Whistleblowing Directive (Directive 2019/1937 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law) will require amendments to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  The General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to the transposition was published on 12 May 2021. The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Taoiseach has recently completed its pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme and I am considering the recommendations in its report. I hope to bring the text of the Bill to Government for approval and publication in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Some of the enhancements to the protected disclosures regime that will be provided for in the Bill will include: an expanded personal scope to include volunteers, shareholders, board members and job applicants; an obligation on private sector organisations with 50 or more employees to have formal whistleblowing systems; a requirement on internal and external recipients of protected disclosures to acknowledge, follow-up and give feedback in respect of all reports received; an extension of the interim relief provisions in the Act to cover acts of penalisation other than dismissal; and the reversal of the burden of proof in civil proceedings concerning penalisation. With these amendments, the</p>  <p>  new legislation will go further in safeguarding protections for those who report wrongdoing. </p>  <p>  In addition, in order to further enhance and improve the implementation of the legislation, a Protected Disclosures Commissioner in the Office of the Ombudsman will be established. They will assist reporting persons in ensuring that external reports get to the right prescribed person or where there is no prescribed person, they will take on responsibility for following up on the report directly ensuring there is a person to receive and follow-up on all external reports of wrongdoing. The Commissioner will also refer protected disclosures sent to Ministers of the Government to the most appropriate authority to assess and follow them up. </p>  <p>  Alongside this legislation, my Department will be issuing updated statutory guidance for public service bodies to coincide with the enactment of the Bill. This will support a high-level and consistent approach to protected disclosures and how they are handled. The next generation of the Training Framework for public sector staff responsible for handling Protected Disclosures is also in the process of being put in place.</p>  <p>  Taken together, all of these measures will significantly strengthen and enhance the statutory protections for whistleblowers in Ireland. </p></reply>

There will be further opportunities for any interested parties to submit their views on this or any other aspect of the FOI system before its conclusion later this year.</p></reply>

This strategy aims to meet key challenges facing us in the short to medium term, allowing us to invest in our economy and society to deliver improvements in infrastructure and public services, while reducing the deficit in order to underpin the sustainability of the public finances as we emerge from the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Provision for up to &euro;7 billion has been made to respond to Covid-19 in 2022, with &euro;3.1 billion of this already allocated and a further &euro;3.9 billion in reserve. The careful phased withdrawal of Covid-19 supports is essential both to support society and the economy to recover from the impact of the pandemic and to return our public finances to a sustainable position, and it will be important that further supports are targeted at where they can have the greatest impact.</p>  <p>  Given the significant level of resources to be provided for both core and temporary spending, an ongoing and enhanced focus on value for money is required.  We must ensure that there is the capacity to deliver the significant level of investment being provided and build on the budgetary reforms already in place to drive spending efficiency and effectiveness.</p>  <p>  Regarding procurement, supply chain issues along with potential inflationary pressures have been well publicised. The last quarter of 2021 showed steep rises in the price of energy. The causes of such increase are many and include unseasonably low temperatures, geo-political tensions and increased demand.   The price of natural gas and electricity remains very volatile.  If higher energy prices are sustained, it is likely they will lead to price inflation in other sections of the economy.</p>  <p>  With regard to construction procurement, the past 12 months has seen significant and sustained increases in the prices of a broad range of commonly-used goods and materials in the construction sector.  In addition, supplies are constrained for certain materials. The causes are many, are global and mostly related to the disruption caused by the pandemic.   </p>  <p>  The current pricing and supply volatility is evidenced by increases in tender prices, a reduction in the numbers of those participating in tenders, delays in the award of contracts as tenderers withdraw and delays to projects where key materials cannot be sourced as readily.</p>  <p>  It is not yet evident as to the duration of these market conditions, the potential for further volatility or price increases, or whether prices of some materials might return to prior levels.</p>  <p>  In response to these uncertain conditions interim amendments have been introduced to provide greater certainty to contractors as to the extent of price inflation that they are expected to bear.  These include:</p>  <p>  1. limited indexation of the tender price to cover price increases to materials in the period between the submission of the tender and the award of the contract</p>  <p>  2. a reduction in the fixed price period once the contract has been awarded to 24 months</p>  <p>  3. provision for the contractor to seek an adjustment to their price once the contract has been awarded should the price of a particular material when purchased increase by more than 15% on its price at the time the contract was awarded.</p></reply>

These agreements have also enabled significant reform of public services and changes to work practices.</p>  <p>  The current public service agreement is Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022. It is important to note that this Agreement is weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants. These groups will also benefit more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premia payment adjustments.</p>  <p>  The Agreement provides for the following pay adjustments: </p>  <p>  - A general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on October 2021. </p>  <p>  - The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1 February 2022.  </p>  <p>  - A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater on, 1 October 2022.</p>  <p>  The Government is determined to ensure the current pay agreement is honoured in full. In this regard, an independent body was established to examine the additional hours worked by public servants under the Haddington Road Agreement. The recommendations of the Body have now been submitted to my Department and I anticipate that the full report will be submitted by the end of January.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Building Momentum is a two year Agreement, which is due to expire at the end of 2022. Accordingly, Government and public service staff representatives will be due to enter into discussions on the potential for a successor agreement later this year. I expect that the issues to which the Deputy has referred will feature in those discussions.</p></reply>

This provided additional funding to support our health service in responding to the impact of the pandemic; to support the operation of public transport; and support the reopening of the Education sector. These measures included income and employment support schemes such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), along with a range of other business supports such as liquidity supports, restart grants and the commercial rates waivers. </p>  <p>  Throughout 2021, &euro;13&frac12; billion was provided for Covid related measures, through the Budget 2021 allocations, Revised Estimates and allocations by way of Further Revised Estimate and Supplementary Estimate from the reserve funding held as a Covid contingency in Budget 2021. This approach allowed for flexible responses to changing needs for supports. This allowed for the continued provision and extension of the PUP, the EWSS, and business supports such as commercial rates waivers, funding to support our health system continue to respond to the impact of Covid, and the necessary funds to support our public transport and education systems operate in a Covid environment. </p></reply>

Management and delivery of investment projects and public services within allocation is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister.</p>  <p>  The update of the Public Spending Code in 2019 combined with lessons learned from domestic projects and international best practice highlighted the need for more structured scrutiny of major public investment projects, particularly in the areas of planned delivery, costings and risk. This is to ensure that Government is making decisions with a full picture of the proposal, its costs, risks and benefits.</p>  <p>  In order to achieve this, my Department has introduced two key reforms: </p>  <p>  - The introduction of an External Assurance Process (EAP) to provide independent project scrutiny at key decision stages. The EAP for major public capital projects (projects which cost in excess of &euro;100m) will focus on issues such as cost, risk and ability to deliver, at two key points in the project lifecycle, Decision Gate 1 (Approval in Principle) and Decision Gate 2 (Pre-Tender Approval). </p>  <p>  - A new Major Projects Advisory Group (MPAG) has been established to further strengthen project management. As a prerequisite to seeking Government approval for projects at the relevant decision gates, project proposals and external reviews will be scrutinised by the MPAG in advance of the decision to proceed. The new arrangements bring Ireland into line with leading international performers and meet a recommendation of the IMF&rsquo;s Public Investment Management Assessment of Ireland. </p>  <p>  - While there was an impact on building activity earlier last year due to Covid restrictions, activity in the sector ramped up significantly when restrictions were lifted in April. </p>  <p>  - Capital expenditure drawdown can be lumpy in any year for any number of reasons such as delays in planning, delays in completion or even weather conditions.  As such, capital carryover is in place to assist Departments with the management of their capital spend across years to alleviate pressures and delays caused by timing issues and the impact of unexpected occurrences. This procedure is also designed to promote value-for-money in the use of capital funding, in particular by mitigating any incentive on the part of public bodies or Departments to spend any remaining capital allocation at end-year in an accelerated manner rather than surrender it to the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  - I firmly believe that the capital carryover facility, as legislated for under Section 91 of the Finance Act, 2004 is the most appropriate provision to assist Departments in managing their capital allocations.

The commitment to review this issue was a key element in agreeing Building Momentum which also provided for sustainable pay increases across the public service over 2021 and 2022. </p><p>I recently received correspondence from the Chairperson with the Independent Body&rsquo;s Conclusions and Recommendations.</p><p>I have not yet received Mr Mulvey's full report and understand that the Independent Body will finalise this by the end of January.  The submission of the final report and its consideration by Government is an important part of the continuing implementation of the Agreement. </p><p>In summary, the Independent Body is recommending that:  </p><p>- The Haddington Road Agreement hours implemented in 2013 will be restored in the majority of relevant civil and public service employments with effect from July 1<sup>st</sup>2022. </p><p>- Working hours for any grade will not be less than the level that applied prior to the Haddington Road Agreement, and in this regard, a minimum floor of 35 hours per week will apply. </p><p>- The Independent Body estimates that the cost of implementing their recommendations is &euro;180 million in 2022. </p><p>A number of steps have been taken in preparation for the potential removal of the Haddington Road Agreement hours.  </p><p>- Firstly, a budget of &euro;150m to replace these hours has already been provided for this year under the terms of Building Momentum.  </p><p>- Secondly, I have communicated details of the potential changes to the relevant Ministers and sectors to enable commencement of any necessary planning at sectoral level regarding the implementation of the recommendations, depending on the decision of Government. </p><p>In conclusion, I look forward to receiving the full report from the Independent Body in the coming weeks.  The Government, continuing to prioritise service delivery, will then respond positively and appropriately to all of the Independent Body&rsquo;s recommendations.</p></reply>

He or she must also comply with the tax clearance obligations of the Ethics Acts, which require that a tax clearance certificate be furnished on his or her appointment. </p>  <p>  However, while the Ethics Acts provide that the registerable interests of our law-makers in the D&aacute;il and Seanad are made public via the respective Registers of Interest for each House, the declarations required under the Ethics Acts from non-elected public officials are not published. </p>  <p>  Under the Constitution, the Attorney is an appointed advisor to, but not a member of, the Government. He or she has no vote in Cabinet, but, as I have pointed out, the statutory framework obliges him or her to make the Taoiseach and the Standards in Public Office Commission aware of any conflicts of interest arising on his or her part so that this can be taken into account in the Government's decision-making process. </p>  <p>  I should clarify further that if an Attorney General happens to be a member of the Oireachtas he or she is deemed to be an office holder (in the same way as a minister), and in addition to their published registrable interests required as a member he or she would be required to disclose additional interests of spouse or family members.  </p>  <p>  We made a commitment in the 2020 Programme for Government to reform and consolidate the Ethics legislation. In preparation, as the Deputy points out, my Department is undertaking a review of the statutory framework, which will inform proposals for reform that I intend to bring forward.  In this regard, I wish to acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s submission on behalf of her party to the public consultation that I undertook as part of this Review. I will seek to take full account of the views of all interested parties, including on the issue to which the Deputy refers, and my Department remains open to further engagement on this important policy agenda, which is so significant for the health of our democracy.</p></reply>

This is to ensure that Government is making decisions with a full picture of the proposal, its costs, risks and benefits.</p>  <p>  The revised NDP pledges to restructure the oversight and implementation of capital projects to strengthen scrutiny of major public investment proposals and to drive improved project performance and value for money.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that the majority of public investment projects are delivered on budget and on time and there is a high level of professionalism across the sectors. However, having recognised the higher risk profile of larger projects, new procedures have been introduced in order to improve project outturns, avoid cost overruns and avoid scheduled delays.</p>  <p>  In November, my Department put in place an External Assurance Process (EAP) to provide independent project scrutiny at key decision stages. This will involve independent expert reviews at two key stages in the project lifecycle under the Public Spending Code (approval in principal and prior to tender).  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the EAP is to improve value for money and support funding departments and Government with expert insight relating to project risks, delivery feasibility, and robustness of costings, governance and procurement. The EAP for major public capital projects (projects which cost in excess of &euro;100m) will focus on issues such as cost, risk and ability to deliver.</p>  <p>  To support the External Assurance Process a new Major Projects Advisory Group (MPAG) has been established to further strengthen project management. As a prerequisite to seeking Government approval for projects at the relevant decision gates, project proposals and external reviews will be scrutinised by the Advisory Group in advance of the decision to proceed. The new arrangements bring Ireland into line with leading international performers and meet a recommendation of the IMF&rsquo;s Public Investment Management Assessment of Ireland.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that timelines associated with Public Spending Code compliance are a fraction of the time required for compliance with the range of statutory requirements such as planning, environmental impact assessment, habitats directive and appropriate assessment. In addition, many Public Spending Code steps can be undertaken in parallel with other project development phases.</p>  <p>  Experience in other countries which have introduced similar independent assurance processes show that such arrangements reduce project schedule delay and project cost overrun.</p></reply>

The Act requires the Commission to obtain the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before reaching an agreement with any person in relation to rates of pay, conditions of employment or superannuation rights.

This comprised almost &euro;77.6 billion in current spending and over &euro;9.9 billion in capital expenditure. This level of expenditure is nearly &euro;2.3 billion or 2.6% higher than expenditure in 2020.</p>  <p>  The total gross amount allocated to Ministerial Vote Groups for 2021 was &euro;88.9 billion. This included original allocations of &euro;82.4 billion made in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2021 (REV) in December 2020, with &euro;72.3 billion in current and &euro;10.1 billion in capital allocations to Departments set out at that time. The REV also included provision for &euro;5.4 billion in contingency funding to respond to the impacts of Covid-19, which was held in reserve rather than allocated at Departmental level in order to allow Government flexibility to respond as needed over the year. This unallocated funding brought the overall Government Expenditure Ceiling for 2021 to &euro;87.8 billion.   </p>  <p>  During 2021, as the Covid-19 pandemic continued to impact following the resurgence of the virus at the end of 2020, additional funding for key response measures was allocated to Departments through Further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates. These additional allocations totalled &euro;6&frac12; billion and were met through using in full the contingency funding that had been set aside and providing additional funding of &euro;1.1 billion which increased the Government Expenditure Ceiling to the end year total of &euro;88.9 billion. Compared to this &euro;88.9 billion overall allocation, the end-December spending position was almost &euro;1.4 billion or 1.5% lower than profiled.</p>  <p>  For the current expenditure element of overall gross spending, the end-December issues figure of &euro;77,596 million was &euro;795 million or 1.0% below the full year allocation which stood at almost &euro;78.4 billion. Compared to end-2020, current expenditure in 2021 was higher by almost &euro;2 billion or 2.6%.</p>  <p>  With regard to capital expenditure, gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;9,946 million was &euro;580 million or 5.5% below the allocation for the year of &euro;10.5 billion. This record &euro;9.9 billion in gross capital expenditure reflects the continued growth in capital investment under the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  The Covid-19 pandemic impacted on the spending plans of Departments in 2021, particularly for capital expenditure where level 5 restrictions in the earlier part of the year had knock-on impacts for infrastructure delivery across a number of departments. </p>  <p>  In net terms, the total net voted expenditure to end-December 2021 amounted to &euro;71,579 million. This was &euro;1,480 million or 2.0% below the full year allocation for 2021 in the Estimates voted by the D&aacute;il and &euro;3,730 million or 5.5% ahead on the same period in 2020. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-20a.166.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012000076#WRD02200"><p>The update of the Public Spending Code in 2019 combined with lessons learned from domestic projects and international best practice highlighted the need for more structured scrutiny of major public investment projects, particularly in the areas of planned delivery, costings and risk. This is to ensure that Government is making decisions with a full picture of the proposal, its costs, risks and benefits.</p>  <p>  The revised NDP pledges to restructure the oversight and implementation of capital projects to strengthen scrutiny of major public investment proposals and to drive improved project performance and value for money.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that the majority of public investment projects are delivered on budget and on time and there is a high level of professionalism across the sectors. However, having recognised the higher risk profile of larger projects, new procedures have been introduced in order to improve project outturns, avoid cost overruns and avoid scheduled delays.</p>  <p>  In November, my Department put in place an External Assurance Process (EAP) to provide independent project scrutiny at key decision stages. This will involve independent expert reviews at two key stages in the project lifecycle under the Public Spending Code (Approval in principal and prior to tender).  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the EAP is to improve value for money and support funding departments and Government with expert insight relating to project risks, delivery feasibility, and robustness of costings, governance and procurement. The EAP for major public capital projects (projects which cost in excess of &euro;100m) will focus on issues such as cost, risk and ability to deliver.</p>  <p>  To support the External Assurance Process a new Major Projects Advisory Group (MPAG) has been established to further strengthen project management. As a prerequisite to seeking Government approval for projects at the relevant decision gates, project proposals and external reviews will be scrutinised by the Advisory Group in advance of the decision to proceed. The new arrangements bring Ireland into line with leading international performers and meet a recommendation of the IMF&rsquo;s Public Investment Management Assessment of Ireland.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that timelines associated with Public Spending Code compliance are a fraction of the time required for compliance with the range of statutory requirements such as planning, environmental impact assessment, habitats directive and appropriate assessment. In addition, many Public Spending Code steps can be undertaken in parallel with other project development phases.</p>  <p>  Experience in other countries which have introduced similar independent assurance processes show that such arrangements reduce project schedule delay and project cost overrun. </p></reply>

Accordingly, any development plans and issues around the future usage of the stadiums are matters for the Council in the first instance.</p>  <p>  My Department provides grant assistance for sporting facilities through the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) and the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). Under the SCEP, grants of up to &euro;300,000 are available to community organisations, sports clubs, national governing bodies of sport and local authorities to develop or refurbish sports facilities. The LSSIF is designed to provide financial support to sports projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP. The first allocations under the LSSIF were announced in January 2020 and to date approximately &euro;86.4m has been provisionally awarded to 33 different proposals.</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council's proposal for the development of Dalymount Park was among the successful projects and a grant of &euro;918,750 was awarded towards the cost of bringing the project to tender stage.  This design work has commenced and my Department made its first payments in respect of this grant towards the end of last year. </p>  <p>  In terms of future usage, I understand that a management strategy for the entire complex including the usage of the pitch will need to be agreed. While this is ultimately a matter for Dublin City Council, I understand that the current plan is that the new stadium will accommodate the male and female senior teams of both Bohemian and Shelbourne Football Clubs. </p>  <p>  With regard to future plans for Tolka Park, a key consideration in the assessment of any applications under the SCEP and the LSSIF is the likelihood of increasing participation including female participation and the government is committed to continued investment in our sport infrastructure in the years ahead. Any future application for funding for Tolka Park under either the SCEP or LSSIF will be considered on its own merits in line with the relevant assessment criteria.</p></reply>

The allocation includes &euro;50 million for business continuity supports and a &euro;35 million increase to the Tourism Marketing Fund to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland.</p>  <p>  As part of its marketing strategy, Tourism Ireland has established a recovery framework which will be underpinned by an extensive programme of promotional activity throughout 2022. Tourism Ireland will continue to work with airlines and ferry companies through a programme of jointly funded marketing initiatives to support the restoration of air and sea access routes which are so vital for tourism&rsquo;s return to growth.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently announced indicative details of how the &euro;50 million funding provided in Budget 2022 for the Tourism Business Continuity Programme will be allocated to assist strategic tourism businesses to recover in 2022. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has designed the programme to support those still experiencing the most difficulty as a result of the pandemic. The phasing of the programme has been set out to make sure that support is provided quickly to the businesses that need it most urgently and taking into account other Government funding that has already been received.</p>  <p>  The Government recently agreed a number of changes to the major economy-wide support schemes available to businesses affected by the latest public health restrictions. Changes were made to the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) and the tax debt warehousing scheme to expand the supports available to businesses affected.</p>  <p>  It is important that future tourism growth must be sustainable as well as being consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments. In that regard, I know that Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are also working towards the longer term goal of ensuring that we are successfully marketed as a sustainable tourism destination. As we rebuild our tourism sector we will seek to realise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be amongst the world leaders in sustainable tourism practices and to set out a path for a green transition of the tourism industry and our destinations to become leading sustainable tourism destinations.</p></reply>

Such events can occur in a range of sectors such as business conferencing, culture and sport.</p>  <p>  Business tourism, including conference tourism, has been an area of growth in recent years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, have operational responsibility for the development and promotion of this sector.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is responsible for developing business tourism strategy and, internationally, it works with Tourism Ireland under the "Meet in Ireland" brand to support the positioning of Ireland as a world-class conference destination.  The "Meet in Ireland" team works collaboratively with key stakeholders and aims to secure high profile conferences for Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The holding of international sports events can provide a positive showcase for Ireland and help attract additional international visitors.  In addition, the media coverage of sports events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination and can contribute to developing a positive international profile.  I am very supportive of the on-going efforts of the tourism agencies and the national governing bodies (NGBs) of sport to attract international events.  Tourism funding and other supports are available through F&aacute;ilte Ireland to assist with the bid stage of strategically important events.  As regards sports funding, as part of the normal annual funding process NGBs can apply to Sport Ireland for funding to assist in meeting the costs involved in hosting major competitions and events.</p>  <p>Looking at 2022 and beyond, I understand that the pipeline of events is looking very positive in terms of events confirmed, events currently being bid for and other events in business development.  With specific regard to those events due to be hosted in Ireland in 2022 and for which F&aacute;ilte Ireland funding has been confirmed, I understand that 18 such events, each due to attract over 1,000 international delegates, are to take place this year.  These include the World Library and Information Conference in Dublin which is due to attract an estimated 3,000 international delegates; an Airline Economics association conference in May 2022 with an estimated 3,500 international delegates; the 11th   World Potato Congress from 30 May to 2 June 2022 at the RDS, with potentially up to 1,900 international delegates; and the 2022 World Lacrosse Men's under-21 World Championship due to take place at the University of Limerick from 10-20 August 2022.  </p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the NGBs, Sport Ireland and other key stakeholders, also supports the hosting of major international sporting events in Ireland, recognising the contribution of such events not just to sport but also to trade, tourism, business, community pride, and community engagement.</p></reply>

The various phases of the Scheme provided a direct financial contribution to support business continuity plans and contribute towards fixed costs.</p>  <p>  Phase One supported businesses that were ineligible to receive the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) such as outdoor tourism activity providers, tourism golf courses, hop-on hop-off tourism bus tour operators, cruise hire companies, tourism boat tour operators, visitor attractions, and caravan and camping and outdoor accommodation providers.  I am happy to confirm that that more than &euro;7.6m was provided to 280 successful applicants in this phase.</p>  <p>  Phase Two supported the tourism transport sector as it was deemed a strategically important sector that enables visitors to access the geographically dispersed Irish tourism offering.  This Phase has seen grants amounting to over &euro;13.3m awarded to 201 applicants.</p>  <p>  Phase One Plus, which is the third Phase of the Scheme, is a continuation of the earlier Phase One.  This phase supported certain tourism businesses that were ineligible or not included in Phase One, or who had missed the deadline.  Under Phase One Plus &euro;1.6m has been provided to 43 applicants.</p>  <p>  Phases 4 and 5 of F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Tourism Business Continuity Scheme closed for applications on Friday, 24 September.  Phase 4 supported attractions and activity tourism operators with Phase 5 supporting F&aacute;ilte Ireland-approved tourism accommodation providers.

The strategic Ireland Based Inbound Agents scheme opened for applications on 12th January 2022.  Further schemes under the Tourism Business Continuity Programme for Attractions and Activity Providers and Tourism Accommodation Providers will commence in March 2022.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked for a breakdown of the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme's allocations and recipients by county.  I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to provide this information to the Deputy.  Please contact my private office if you have not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

This is a matter I have been considering closely for some time.</p>  <p>  The issue of providing for avenues of redress in terms of individual pieces of content in the online world is complex. The approach in the development of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill to date has been to provide the Online Safety Commissioner with the power to require that regulated online services have effective complaints mechanisms in place with powers of audit and investigation provided to the Commissioner in that respect. The Bill also provides for a super complaints mechanism whereby nominated bodies may notify the Commissioner of concerns regarding a designated online service&rsquo;s compliance with an online safety code, or of concerns relating to the availability of harmful online content on a service.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism raises a number of complex practical and legal issues, including in terms of the sheer volume of content online, that Ireland will be regulating a number of services on an EU wide basis, and questions relating to due process requirements and how quickly decisions could reasonably be made by the Online Safety Commissioner.</p>  <p>  In light of the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, I am examining how these difficult issues can be addressed. As I announced last week, I will shortly establish an expert advisory group to report within 90 days on these matters with recommendations for how best to address these issues. I intend to announce the membership of the group in the coming days. Following the report of the group, I will consider whether and how to give effect to any recommendations through amendments to the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill at Committee Stage.</p></reply>

It is intended to build on this for this year&rsquo;s Culture Night.</p>  <p>  Work is well underway with our partners in the local authority to start the pilot initiative establishing new "Night-Time Advisors" in six cities and towns to develop new Night-Time Economy opportunities.  </p>  <p>  My Department also recently worked with the nightclub sector (Give Us The Night), the vintners associations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the local authorities to deliver on-line vulnerability training for nightclubs and bars as they plan for a full reopening. This training was very well received and is being rolled out in support of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce Report recommendation which highlighted the issue of public safety.</p>  <p>  Progress is also being made by my own Department and other members of the Taskforce, working with stakeholders, in the development of responses to many of the other actions also and I look forward to continued progress across all areas of this Report over the coming months.</p></reply>

There is also a need to look even further, beyond the challenges that have been brought upon by the impact of the pandemic, to ensure a long term shift towards a more sustainable tourism ecosystem.</p>  <p>  Late last year I brought a report to Government, developed by the Sustainable Tourism Working Group under the aegis of my Department, which identifies a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices ahead of the development of a new national tourism policy. The successful implementation of the actions in this interim action plan will ensure that sustainability is taken into account in policy development, business planning by the tourism agencies and industry as well as in destination management and promotional activity. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, I secured a record level of funding for tourism. This funding will support measures to help address short-term survival-related concerns and also enable recovery across the tourism sector as we reopen to international tourism and begin to transition to a more sustainable future. In addition this funding will also allow the tourism agencies to deliver on their commitments in the sustainable tourism interim action plan. </p>  <p>  For example, this year F&aacute;ilte Ireland will develop and roll out a suite of supports and workshops to help tourism businesses to implement sustainability best practice and use the benefits of sustainability for their business. F&aacute;ilte Ireland will also initiate the development of carbon calculators which will allow tourists and tourism businesses to evaluate the impact of their carbon footprint on the environment. Tourism Ireland will create new sales and marketing opportunities for those sustainable tourism businesses that want to grow their international business. Measures such as these will shine a light on areas and destinations at home that are striving to be best in class in terms of sustainability and provide better access to information and tools for the tourism industry and visitors to practice responsible tourism.</p>  <p>  In line with our Programme for Government commitments, officials within my Department have taken initial steps towards the development of a new national tourism policy which will mainstream sustainability. It is clear that the traditional model of tourism is changing and the development of this new policy will set out a path for the coming years and beyond which will support a sustainable recovery, not only from an environmental but also social and economic viewpoints.</p>  <p>  To successfully deliver on sustainable tourism we need to provide high quality environments and experiences which drive improved visitor satisfaction levels with a greater regional spread of tourism visitation and value. I look forward to this transition for the tourism industry and for our destinations with better access to information and tools for visitors to practice responsible tourism.</p></reply>

This is a matter I have been considering closely for some time.</p>  <p>  The issue of providing for avenues of redress in terms of individual pieces of content in the online world is complex. The approach in the development of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill to date has been to provide the Online Safety Commissioner with the power to require that regulated online services have effective complaints mechanisms in place with powers of audit and investigation provided to the Commissioner in that respect. The Bill also provides for a super complaints mechanism whereby nominated bodies may notify the Commissioner of concerns regarding a designated online service&rsquo;s compliance with an online safety code, or of concerns relating to the availability of harmful online content on a service.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism raises a number of complex practical and legal issues, including in terms of the sheer volume of content online, that Ireland will be regulating a number of services on an EU wide basis, and questions relating to due process requirements and how quickly decisions could reasonably be made by the Online Safety Commissioner.</p>  <p>  In light of the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, I am examining how these difficult issues can be addressed. As I announced last week, I will shortly establish an expert advisory group to report within 90 days on these matters with recommendations for how best to address these issues. I intend to announce the membership of the group in the coming days.  Following the report of the group, I will consider these recommendations in the context of potential  amendments to the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill at Committee Stage.</p></reply>

The resilience of these sectors, in the face of the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic, has been remarkable, particularly as many were among the first sectors to close and are the last to return to full capacity.</p><p>Recognising that resilience and the hugely important role that these sectors play in Ireland's collective economic and social well-being, I will continue to work with the stakeholders to monitor the evolving situation and to work with my Government colleagues to support these sectors and, with officials and Government colleagues, to support a strong and stable recovery as we emerge from the pandemic.</p></reply>

The report identifies a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices ahead of the development of a new national tourism policy. The successful implementation of these actions will shine a light on areas and destinations that are striving to be best in class in terms of sustainability and will provide better access to information and tools for the tourism industry and visitors to practice responsible tourism. In particular F&aacute;ilte Ireland will help to establish Ireland as a leading sustainable tourism destination by supporting Government investment in leveraging Ireland&rsquo;s national capital. For example, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will work with the National Transport Authority to give appropriate consideration to linkages to ferry ports and the rail network when considering new walking trail developments and extensions to existing trails.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Department of Transport has undertaken a review of the services and facilities available to accommodate foot and cycle passengers at our seaports and on ferry services out of Ireland. While the travel restrictions imposed by COVID-19 and the impacts of Brexit delayed this work for a time, I am informed that as restrictions ease engagement with the shipping operators on the issue of foot passengers will resume shortly.</p>  <p>  I also understand that the Department of Transport will also engage with the passenger ports at Dublin, Rosslare and Cork on their plans for ensuring continued access to ferry services for foot passengers, working with the ferry companies in this regard. Based on the outcome of that engagement, the Department of Transport will assess what changes need to be encouraged to enhance the passenger experience and make it a more attractive option for the travelling public.</p></reply>

These fall under the following headings and correspond to specific actions in the Government&rsquo;s 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language, 2010-2030. </p><p>- Irish Language Support Scheme; </p><p>- Technological and Digital Initiative; </p><p>- Advanced Irish Language Skills Initiative; </p><p>- Universities abroad.</p><p>Additionally, the enactment of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act in December 2021 has added a great impetus to engage further with colleagues across the public service to increase the use of Irish and my officials are working to establish the necessary structures to successfully implement the provisions in the Act. </p><p>I welcome the end of the derogation on the use of the Irish language in the EU institutions at the end of 2021 and I am very committed to the promotion of the Irish language across the public service at home and in Europe and intend to ensure that it is embedded in the fabric of our public services. </p><p>To that end, my Department has been working to promote EU Irish language positions and continues to engage with the Public Appointments Service (www.publicjobs.ie) and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) to promote all positions and to encourage various stakeholders to promote Irish language vacancies on their social media channels in order to reach potential candidates.  </p><p><b>Irish Language Support Scheme</b></p><p>On a national level, the Irish Language Support Scheme provides funding for a variety of projects for promoting the usage of Irish in domains as follows:  </p><p>- Language supports for businesses - Gaillimh le Gaeilge, Gn&oacute; Mhaigh Eo, and the recently-launched, Baile &Aacute;tha Cliath le Gaeilge;  </p><p>- Youth development - TechSpace and Gluaiseacht; </p><p>- Theatre and Media - An Taibhdhearc and Raidi&oacute; R&iacute; R&aacute;;  </p><p>- Family - Sc&eacute;im Teanga T&iacute; de chuid Ghl&oacute;r na nGael. </p><p>In addition, the Department has provided supports for initiatives to promote a diverse range of careers using the Irish language. For example, the Department funded the development of a range of video content on the Careers Portal website &lsquo;Saol Oibre.&rsquo; These videos are available on www.saoloibre.ie  </p><p><b>Advanced Irish Language Skills Initiative</b></p><p>In 2006, the Department established the Advanced Irish Language Skills Initiative. This initiative was put in place in order to increase the number of qualified persons with Irish language skills in the context of the requirements arising from the status of Irish as an official and working language of the EU and also from the implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003. </p><p>The fund, which is administered by the Department in conjunction with the Higher Education Authority (HEA), provides funding for a range of specialised third-level Irish language courses in areas such as translation, interpretation, IT and law. Currently there are 12 courses, provided by various institutions, in operation. These programmes have had a major input into increasing the translation capacity of EU institutions, thus ending of the derogation on the Irish language&rsquo;s status in the EU.</p><p><b>Aistritheoir&iacute; &Oacute;ga</b></p><p>The fourth Aistritheoir&iacute; &Oacute;ga competition for secondary schools has taken place in conjunction with the European Commission. A total of 68 secondary school students from 28 schools participated, with my Department sponsoring the prizes for all winners. I was delighted that the five winners could join me at a virtual ceremony held on Friday 30<sup>th</sup>April 2021 to celebrate their achievements and it is my hope that I can meet future winners in person in the years to come.</p><p><b>Internship scheme </b></p><p>The Internship scheme which launched in 2018 has continued to be a great success. A total of 40 applications were received in 2021. My Department appointed 7 interns to contribute to the work in the various institutions this year. Feedback from the EU Institutions has been overwhelmingly positive and many of the interns have been offered contracts for positions within the EU institutions.  </p><p><b>Universities Abroad</b></p><p>Also in the field of third level education, my Department provides funding for the Fulbright Ireland scholarship scheme in the USA and the Ireland-Canada University Foundation scheme. Under these programmes, successful applicants spend a year in U.S. and Canadian universities working as Foreign Language Teaching Assistants (FLTAs) and teach Irish language and culture. Students also have an opportunity to visit the Gaeltacht to learn Irish language and culture from native speakers. My Department also funds numerous universities in Europe in order to support the teaching of Irish.</p><p><b>Technological and Digital Initiatives</b></p><p>My Department provides funding for a range of initiatives for the promotion of Irish in the field of technology. A Digital Strategy for Irish is currently being prepared which addresses gaps such as speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology, machine translation and sharing of translation resources such as translation memories - all vitally important in the provision of public services. I look forward to launching the Strategy in the coming months and believe that this will add greatly to the career opportunities using the Irish language as well as the provision of resources for translators and Irish speakers.</p></reply>

In recognition of that fact I established the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce in 2020 as a response to the Pandemic, and to provide a platform for solution-focused recommendations for the recovery of the Arts and Culture sector.</p><p>The Taskforce reported to me in November 2020 and made ten recommendations on the across the following themes:</p><p>- income, taxation and financial provision measures;</p><p>- education and training supports;</p><p>- technology supports;</p><p>- mental health supports;</p><p>- social protection measures;</p><p>- copyright measures;</p><p>I established an Oversight Group tasked with appraising the level of implementation of the Taskforce recommendations.Earlier this month, I  welcomed the publication of a report from the Oversight Committee on the implementation of the recommendations made in the &ldquo;Life Worth Living&rdquo; Report.</p><p>I am delighted that we have been able to respond to many of the recommendations made by the Taskforce, with over 75% of the recommendations already implemented. </p><p>The number one recommendation of the taskforce was the introduction of a basic income for the arts pilot scheme (BIA). I have allocated &euro;25m in 2022 to launch the pilot BIA in 2022 which remains one of my key priorities. </p><p>Significant work has been done to realise this as a practical and substantial support for the arts and cultural sector, including a stakeholder forum held on the 15th of December to inform key policy areas of the Scheme and an open consultation that is currently open to the public.  </p><p>Other recommendations that have also been implemented include;</p><p>- A review of the Resilience and recovery 2020-2021 Plan for Living with COVID-19;</p><p>- Establishing a capacity building and upskilling scheme for artists and creative workers through professional development;</p><p>- Establishing a programme that provides wellbeing supports to the creative sector;</p><p>- The provision of financial support to local authorities to enable them to maintain their investment in arts, culture and events at 2020 levels;</p><p>- Transposing the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market into Irish law;</p><p>- Introducing a Business Supports Grants Scheme for SMEs in the events</p><p>- industry that are excluded from the COVID-19 Restrictions Support</p><p>- Scheme (CRSS); </p><p>- Establishing &quot;Re-Imagining our public spaces&quot; as part of a capital improvement programme; </p><p>- Establishing and funding a Creative Green Programme.</p><p>The report is available via this link:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/a83f6-minister-catherine-martin-publishes-a-progress-report-on-the-arts-and-culture-recovery-taskforce-recommendations/</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-20a.302.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012000079#WRG01700"><p>Increased participation in sport is a key objective of my Department. In the pursuit of that objective, we are committed to a Sport for All approach aimed at ensuring that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity, regardless of age, social-economic status, disability, or membership of, for example, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community or other ethnic minorities. Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027.</p>  <p>  At the end of November 2021, I launched a new Sports Action Plan covering the period up to the end of 2023, which includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. The plan's emphasis is heavily orientated towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.</p>  <p>  That plan contains a specific commitment to establish an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund to promote increased and sustainable participation in sport among children, adolescents and young adults, those from lower socio-economic groups, persons with a disability, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community and other ethnic minorities. It further commits that this new fund will apply the Sport for all&rsquo; ethos.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, work is underway to embed the Sport for All approach in other funding streams provided by my Department.  For example, Dormant Accounts funds that are specifically aimed at increasing participation levels amongst disadvantaged communities and people with a disability. Forthcoming rounds of funding will place further emphasis on the Sport for All approach. The total amount of funding being allocated for such projects this year is &euro;12 million, more than twice the amount available a number of years ago and representing a 20% increase on last year's provision.  </p>  <p>  One of the key aims of the national sports policy is to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport support entirely by 2027. The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor, ISM, report showed that the gender gap in sports participation was 3.4%, narrower than at any point over the past ten years. Unfortunately, while the ISM report for the first quarter of 2021 showed that the gender gap was eliminated during the Covid-19 restrictions, the latest ISM figures for quarter 3 showed that the gender gap was beginning to re-emerge as Covid-19 restrictions were lifted. In quarter 3 of 2021, male sport participation had returned to pre-pandemic levels, at 48%, while female participation was 38%, 7% behind the level measured in 2019.</p>  <p>  The emerging gradient is a cause for focus, concern and ongoing monitoring. It is now crucial that we move to ensure that the gap is narrowed and closed. To this end, many governing bodies will begin to deliver women in sport in dormant accounts funding programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have disproportionately been impacted by the pandemic, including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities. </p>  <p>  These targeted activities form part of a winter initiative for sport to kickstart participation following the reduction in restrictions. </p>  <p>  I would also like to emphasise the important contribution that Sport Ireland makes in this area. Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards.  </p>  <p>  In May 2021, Sport Ireland published its Participation Plan 2021-2024 &ndash; Increasing Participation in Changing Ireland. The Participation Plan outlines how Sport Ireland will continue to help people get active by removing barriers to participation in sport and physical activity in the coming years. The Sport Ireland Participation Plan actions will be delivered through Local Sports Partnerships, National Governing Bodies, strategic partners, clubs, communities and individuals.</p>  <p>  The Sport Ireland Participation Plan is built on, and guided by, the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 (NSP) and the Sport Ireland Strategy 2018-2022. The Participation Plan takes into consideration Healthy Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013&ndash;2025 and the National Physical Activity Plan as well as global and national developments.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that Sport Ireland is in the process of developing a specific Diversity and Inclusion policy which is expected to be launched in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

As part of this suite of supports and, building on the success and exceptional demand for the Live Performance Support Scheme 2021 (LPSS 2021), a further strand of this scheme called the LPSS 3 opened for applications on December 20th.  In addition to LPSS 3, further supports will also be provided for the sector in 2022, including;</p>  <p>  - Another strand of the Live Performance Support Scheme (LPSS 4), to support performances being staged from February 2022 to June 2022.

This investment will greatly benefit the artists in this area and help address the deficit in artist workspaces in Dublin City.</p><p>The Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 provides capital grants for arts and culture centres and is administered by my Department.  The schemes focus on enhancing the existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country. In line with the Government's action on climate change, projects that reduce an organisation's carbon footprint that will make a real and positive impact on the environment, are prioritised, as are projects that provide additional capacity for artists and artistic production. The Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 is constructed of a number of funding steams one of which is Stream C which is aimed at upgrading visual artists' workspaces and was run by Visual Artists Ireland (VAI) on behalf of my Department.</p><p>The Arts Council operates many current funding schemes and initiatives for the particular support of visual arts, including the Visual Artists Workspace Scheme, to support artists&rsquo; and provide the best possible working environment for visual artists.</p><p>The  Creative Ireland Programme is a culture-based programme led by my Department to promote individual, community and national wellbeing.  Under its Creative Communities initiative, my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022.  These strategies were developed by local authorities, including their Arts Offices, following extensive local public consultation.  They are unique to each local authority, reflecting the breadth of cultural and creative work being undertaken in each area thereby empowering creatives and artists to live and work in their local communities.</p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme has also explored community and collaborative place-making initiatives that might serve as a catalyst for change and opportunity for further investment.  With Programme funding during 2021, for example, the Irish Architecture Foundation worked with a network of 46 community organisations - Community Organization and Residents Network (CORN) - across the South West Inner City to reimagine a future for Marshalsea Barracks that once loomed large in Dublin 8 community life and local history.</p><p>In response to Covid 19 the Outdoor Public Space Scheme was introduced by my Department  to help local authorities open up and create public spaces and facilities dedicated to the arts, culture and festivals. The scheme was developed in consultation with the County and City Management Association and with input from F&aacute;ilte Ireland. Each local authority can apply for up to &euro;250,000 under the scheme. To date, 18 local authorities have been awarded funding of more than &euro;4.4 million under this scheme.  Under the scheme, local authorities are encouraged to prioritise place-making projects that support cultural endeavour and enable safe social activity. </p><p>Under the commercial entertainment capital grant scheme, a total of 88 grants of up to &euro;25,000 each have been awarded to venues, performance facilities and private sector classes throughout the country for Covid adaptation improvements, including ventilation. These grants have been paid out by my Department last month.</p><p>The issues raised by the Deputies were discussed during the consultation process for the Report of the Night-Time Economy which I launched last year.  Planning was a key discussion point for the Taskforce and they recommended the<b></b>development of specific best practice guidance to assist local authorities in including appropriate, locally-tailored provisions to plan effectively for the Night-Time Economy, which includes cultural spaces, in a multi-use urban context.  I will also be hosting a high-level workshop with Minister O&rsquo;Brien and Minister of State Burke this year with the night-time economy sector and key stakeholders to discuss possible solutions and ideas in this area and I look forward to the outcome of those discussions.  There are many other recommendations which will work towards finding solutions to the issues raised including a number of Arts Council led actions to facilitate more use of publicly-owned cultural buildings and heritage sites for events and to create a viable model for the development of sustainable creative co-operatives looking at national and international best practice.  </p><p>My Department does not provide funding to organisations to purchase land or buildings. </p><p>The Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) was launched in 2018 to support more compact and sustainable development.  The Department for Housing, Planning, and Local Government has responsibility for its implementation. The URDF is supporting a programme of significant transformational capital projects that will contribute to the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns.  I understand that there were two calls for proposals already under the URDF and  there has been an allocation to Dublin City Council in respect of Artists Workspaces.</p><p>My Department is also funding a major programme of investment in our National Cultural Institutions under the National Development Plan.  These institutions are largely based in Dublin City.  </p></reply>

This campaign will also be expanded in Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Nordic countries, Switzerland, Austria, Canada and the UAE.</p>  <p>  St Patrick&rsquo;s Day offers a unique opportunity for the island of Ireland around the world and once again this year, hundreds of iconic landmarks and buildings around the world will take part in Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Global Greening initiative.</p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland will continue to work with airlines and ferry companies through a programme of jointly funded marketing initiatives to support the restoration of air and sea access routes which are so vital for tourism&rsquo;s return to growth.</p>  <p>  Since the early days of the pandemic, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has invested heavily in promoting staycations in Ireland.  In that regard, they have embarked on extensive marketing and communications campaigns, including their "Keep Discovering" domestic marketing campaign, which continue to encourage domestic holidaymakers to take vacations in Ireland, particularly during quieter shoulder seasons.  The agency has also provided a Keep Discovering Marketing Toolkit on their website which offers free marketing tools, templates, helpful guides and curated images to assist tourism businesses in attracting more visitors. </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also remains focused on helping businesses to promote Ireland as an international destination and continues to assist Irish tourism attractions and activities across the country to try to influence the travel itineraries of tour operators and Destination Management Companies for 2022 and beyond.  </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently announced indicative details of how the &euro;50 million funding provided in Budget 2022 for the Tourism Business Continuity Programme will be allocated to assist strategic tourism businesses to recover in 2022. The agency will also be hosting a series of virtual industry events in late January and February to further outline their plans to continue supporting the recovery of the sector.</p></reply>

In recognition of the importance of the Night-Time Economy, I published and launched the Report of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce last September which contains 36 recommendations/actions in the area of regulation, licensing, planning, transport, safety and increasing the diversity of activities as part of the night-time offering.   I am working with colleagues across Government and stakeholders to drive the implementation of the various actions in this Report and work is well underway to implement the actions in the Report.</p>  <p>  With regard to the reopening of the night-time economy and particularly the nightclub sector, in its decision of 19 October 2021, Government agreed that the remaining aspects of the hospitality, entertainment and night-time economy sector could reopen with a full range of protective measures in place and the wide and robust implementation of the COVID-19 pass.  Nightclubs were permitted to open at 100% capacity but those attending were required to have an electronic ticket, acquired at least one hour in advance, for contact tracing purposes. </p>  <p>  At that time, I said that my Department would carry out a review in three weeks to assess how the post 22 October measures had worked on the ground and also to consider whether there were other measures that sectors could take to assist with the public health goals. However, as the Deputy will be aware, approximately three weeks later, the epidemiological situation had deteriorated and unfortunately the Government had to make the difficult decision to impose new restrictions which brought in a midnight closing time for all pubs, restaurants and nightclubs.  Subsequent decisions, based on public health advice, have meant the effective closure of the nightclub sector. </p>  <p>Throughout this challenging period, my officials and I and colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Health and the Department of An Taoiseach have continued to engage with the various sectors that operate in the night-time economy to address some of the challenges faced and plan for the next phase of reopening.  My Department recently met with the sector on Thursday 13th   January.  Nightclubs will be able to re-open as soon as public health circumstances permit. In making decisions, Government is always conscious of following public health advice and any decisions made to in relation to re-opening the nightclubs will be decided on the current public health advice. I will continue to work with these sectors as we move through the different stages of recovery from this incredibly challenging period. </p></reply>

The Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003.  </p><p>All grants issued by the Arts Council are published on the <b>Who we funded </b>section of the Council's website available at this link www.artscouncil.ie/funding-decisions/?&amp;amp;Fund=Arts%20Centre%20Funding&amp;amp;Year=2020&amp;amp;Location=356#search</p><p>The details of the significant level of funding provided to the institution in question is published.  Also shown is that the grant allocated in 2021 by the Arts Council was an increase on its 2020 grant.</p><p>The Council also has in place a number of new and enhanced funding programmes introduced in response to COVID-19.  One of these is an Emergency Stabilisation Fund to provide once-off financial support to Strategic Funded and Arts Centre Funded organisations that are in need of emergency grant aid. Over 2021  the Arts Council provided funding for 12 organisations that protected them from closure, with &euro;1.7 million from the emergency stability fund.  Over &euro;8 million was awarded through the agility award to over 1,800 individual artists, and &euro;4.3 million was awarded in a capacity building support scheme funding for 248 organisations. </p><p>Recent decades have seen the development of a nationwide infrastructure of  institutions such as that referred to by the Deputy including a range arts centres, many of which are funded by local authorities and supported through capital schemes largely operated by my Department. Support provided to these arts centres by local authorities is critical to ensuring that a stable and vibrant network can be maintained. Capital funding schemes operated by my Department continue to be focused on enhancing this existing stock of arts and culture centres throughout the country. </p><p>In response to COVID-19, my Department opened a capital stream (Stream D) of funding specifically for capital adaptations or equipment necessary to assist arts and culture organisations in re-opening.  To date, &euro;977,000 has been allocated to 104 arts and culture organisations with &euro;818,000 of this paid to 100 organisations.</p></reply>

Central to developing a more resilient and sustainable tourism sector will be an increased focus on the promotion and development of sustainable tourism practices such as ecotourism. I recently brought a report to Government which identifies a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented prior to the development of a new national tourism policy. The successful implementation of these actions will shine a light on areas and destinations that are striving to be best in class in terms of sustainability and provide better access to information and tools for the tourism industry and visitors to practice responsible tourism.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the important role that tourism plays as a driver of rural economies and I am committed to a continued focus on the potential of tourism to facilitate the development of our rural areas. As we rebuild our tourism sector we will seek to realise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition to be amongst the world leaders in sustainable tourism practices and to set out a path for a green transition of the tourism industry and for our destinations to become leading sustainable tourism destinations.</p>  <p>  Our overall tourism product offering has led to Ireland being recognised internationally as a year-round, high-quality tourism destination in both urban and rural settings.  The further development of our tourism product offering, including any specific plans relating to environmentally sustainable tourism or eco-tourism, is an operational matters for F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Accordingly, I have referred this question to the agency for direct response to the Deputy.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.</p></reply>

This robust and wide-ranging research programme covers the views of 1,000 employers and 3,500 workers with tourism and hospitality experience as well as international benchmarking, a review of education provision and consultation with recruitment agencies. This research is shaping F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s work programmes for the year ahead which will focus on: </p>  <p>  - Supporting recruitment to drive recovery:  to provide support to the industry to address the immediate labour and skills supply challenges, which will be critical to the short-medium term recovery of the sector.</p>  <p>  - Supporting the long-term repositioning of the industry: to support businesses and the wider industry to work together to drive the long-term repositioning of the industry as an appealing and rewarding career choice and workplace, and ensure a future pipeline of talent.</p>  <p>  - Building employee capability and skills: to build the capability of individual employees to help businesses to bridge the skills gaps they are experiencing and also drive greater employee retention by improving the quality of training across the business.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also chairs the Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group (COG) which will continue to work closely with industry bodies, education providers and other Government bodies to support sustainable employment in the tourism sector with an immediate focus on recruitment and retention initiatives, as well as focusing on the long-term repositioning of the industry as a career choice.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department participate in the Interdepartmental Group on Work Permits chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Most recently the work of the Group resulted in up to 350 work permits being granted for managerial positions in certain tourism and hospitality businesses. Earlier this year my Department also successfully advocated for the prioritisation of chef permit applications.</p>  <p>  I have also recently worked with Minister Donohoe on the extension of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. I will continue to engage with and provide support to the tourism sector through these challenging times.</p></reply>

The allocation includes &euro;50 million for business continuity supports and a &euro;35 million increase to the Tourism Marketing Fund to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland. Due to the devastating impact of COVID-19, the impact of Brexit on our tourism sector may not become apparent for some time.</p>  <p>  As part of its marketing strategy, Tourism Ireland has established a recovery framework entitled: RESTART, REBUILD and REDESIGN, which will be underpinned by an extensive programme of promotional activity throughout 2022. I was happy to help Tourism Ireland launch its new &lsquo;Green Button&rsquo; marketing campaign in the UK recently where I engaged with our industry partners to reassure them that Ireland was open and waiting to welcome back visitors. Tourism Ireland strongly promotes Cork Airport and the Port of Cork, through initiatives like the Regional Cooperative Marketing Fund which seeks to encourage new access and maximise the potential of existing services to the region. F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to work to further develop tourism in Cork in both the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East regional brand areas, and is involved in a wide variety of activity in both of these regional brand areas. </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently announced indicative details of how the &euro;50m funding provided in Budget 2022 for the Tourism Business Continuity Programme will be allocated to assist strategic tourism businesses to recover in 2022. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has designed the programme to support those still experiencing the most difficulty as a result of the pandemic. The phasing of the programme has been set out to make sure that support is provided quickest to the businesses that need it most urgently and taking into account other Government funding that has already been received. The Strategic Tourism Transport Business Continuity Scheme opened for applications on 11th January 2022 and the Strategic Ireland Based Inbound Agents Tourism Business Continuity Scheme opened for applications on 12th January. The Attractions and Activity Tourism Operators Business Continuity Scheme will launch on 8th March and the Tourism Accommodation Providers Business Continuity Scheme will launch on 9th March. </p>  <p>  The Government recently agreed a number of changes to the major economy-wide support schemes available to businesses affected by the latest public health restrictions. Changes were made to the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) and the tax debt warehousing scheme to expand the supports available to businesses affected.</p>  <p>  The Tourism Recovery Oversight Group continue to report to me on a regular basis, with updates on the implementation of the recommendations set out in the Tourism Recovery Plan 2020 &ndash; 2023 and on the recovery of the sector. These reports continue to inform my thinking, and that of my colleagues in Government, with regard to ongoing measures to support the sector.</p></reply>

The Commission members included experts in public service media, independent journalism, social media, new technology platforms, media economics, culture, language, creative content, governance and international best practice.</p>  <p>  One of the goals of the Commission was to identify what the experience has been for public service broadcasters, other broadcasters, print and online media at local, regional and national level in delivering public service aims, and the challenges created for these media by new global platforms and changing audience preferences in relation to how content is delivered.</p>  <p>  The Commission engaged comprehensively with stakeholders, including broadcasters, journalists, publishers, regional media, social media companies and the wider public. The first phase of the Future of Media Commission public consultation resulted in over 800 written submissions from stakeholder groups and the general public, including social media and conventional media, on a wide range of themes.</p>  <p>  At the end of January 2021, the Commission began a series of thematic dialogues through online webinars in which panels of experts explored key themes in more depth and answered follow-up questions from the virtual audience and the Commission members. It explored many topics, including the evolving role of social media.</p>  <p>  The work of the Future of Media Commission has now been completed and their report has been submitted to An Taoiseach and myself for consideration. It will provide a basis for media and broadcasting policy in the coming years and An Taoiseach and I are carefully considering the contents of the wide-ranging report.</p>  <p>  Following this, the report will be brought to Cabinet for further consideration and agreement on the next steps.</p></reply>

The proposed project was initially on an identified site in Cahercon, Kildysert, Co. Clare. </p>  <p>  I have been advised by Enterprise Ireland that subsequent to the grant approval and detailed examination of this site by the promoters, it was established that the renovation costs necessary to develop the planned facilities would be multiples of the originally forecasted costs. These increased costs meant the project was no longer viable as envisaged in Cahercon. As a result the promoters sought alternative options for the delivery of this project. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that the promoters have currently identified a site in Kilrush to locate the planned training activities, while the marine research facility option will primarily remain in Cahercon, which has a jetty on the site. The promoters have plans to deliver this solution in 2022 and are putting in place a strategy to secure the additional funding necessary to underpin the project, with potential additional funding provided by Clare County Council and a possible further application to be made to the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland have advised that they are continuing to work with the promoters to ensure the delivery of this project.</p></reply>

The results in 2021 represent a strong start to IDA&rsquo;s new 2021-2024 strategy, <i>Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth</i>, which seeks to further enhance FDI&rsquo;s place at the centre of a resilient, sustainable, and inclusive Irish economy. </p><p>The number of IDA jobs created in 2020 and 2021 for each Local Authority area is not available, however the number of jobs created by County is shown in the table below:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2021 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td>30</td>       <td>94</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>39</td>       <td>1,360</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>50</td>       <td>129</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td>92</td>       <td>30</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>288</td>       <td>387</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin </td>       <td>12,202</td>       <td>15,153</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td>919</td>       <td>609</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>355</td>       <td>558</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>212</td>       <td>130</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>217</td>       <td>69</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>821</td>       <td>650</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>787</td>       <td>1,140</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>167</td>       <td>346</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>42</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td>49</td>       <td>186</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>109</td>       <td>151</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>179</td>       <td>381</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td>115</td>       <td>178</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>91</td>       <td>133</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>449</td>       <td>777</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>209</td>       <td>285</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td>4,065</td>       <td>3,416</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>69</td>       <td>50</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>1,469</td>       <td>2,536</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>271</td>       <td>178</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>120</td>       <td>110</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-20a.375.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012000081#WRJ01300"><p>Under the EU Treaties, competence for International Trade Policy, known as the Common Commercial Policy, and including Trade Defence, is vested in the European Commission under Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  In exercising this competence, there are a variety of supporting Committees and Working Parties through which the Member States and the Commission engage, including on Trade Defence measures.</p>  <p>  An "anti-dumping" investigation allows the Commission to determine whether goods being imported into the EU are being sold below the price charged in the domestic market of the producing country, i.e. being dumped on the EU market to the detriment of EU producers. During the investigation process, the Commission endeavours to engage with all stakeholders including exporters, importers and user interests to gain a broad understanding of the supply chains of the product(s) concerned and the, on occasion, competing interests of producers and</p>  <p>   users in order to reach a balanced outcome that defends Union producers from unfair competition while ensuring that users and importers can continue to source goods from a wide variety of producers, including other third country producers.</p>  <p>  "Definitive" anti-dumping investigations, such as in the case identified by the Deputy, are dealt with by the Trade Defence Instruments Committee, which is convened by the European Commission. Voting on definitive measures is conducted by way of Qualified Majority Voting (QMV) and the imposition of measures requires a qualified majority in favour of the proposal. To reach the qualified majority threshold, 55% of EU Member States (15) representing at least 65% of the total EU population must vote in favour of a measure. In this regard, however, I must emphasise that all aspects of the consultations within the Trade Defence Instruments Committee, including the votes of individual Member States, are confidential.</p>  <p>  My Department, as part of its role in assessing Commission trade defence investigations proposals, engages with domestic producers, local importers and users, where identified, with the aim of assessing both the impact of dumping on the Irish market including the impact the proposed trade defence measures may have on users and importers of the product in question. </p>  <p>  Decisions regarding Ireland&rsquo;s position on specific trade issues are considered through a prism of a number of policy considerations with a balanced position sought as they relate to issues of trade policy, such as Union producer, user and consumer interests. Furthermore, while Ireland continues to support an open, rules-based trading environment, at the same time, we also need to ensure that agreed multilateral trade-rules are applied uniformly, with full transparency to ensure that wider EU commercial interests are protected, and that EU industry is not unfairly disadvantaged as a result of third country trade practices that distort the EU market.  Equally, measures must be proportionate in rebalancing the market and be deployed carefully and on a strong evidential basis. In this regard, I am confident that this approach allows for a methodical and comprehensive assessment of the facts of a case while taking into account the interests of users and importers and the general interests of the Union.</p>  <p>  Specific to the case in question, the Trade Defence team in my Department has received representations from several interested parties. The representations provided information such as the status of Irish manufacturing of the product, concerns regarding the inflationary impact of proposed trade defence measures, the lack of alternative sources of supply and the impact COVID-19 has had on the ability of Irish and European importers to source material elsewhere. So, I wish to assure the Deputy, that these inputs have been included as part of my Department's overall assessment of the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal. Moreover, Member States have been asked to submit their opinion on the case to the Trade Defence Committee by the 19th January with the final outcome of the Trade Defence Committee&rsquo;s assessment to be published in the Official Journal of the EU.  While I must reiterate that individual Member State positions are confidential, my Department fully understands the interests that several importers have brought to our attention and the implications for them of a positive decision by the EU's Trade Defence Instruments Committee. </p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to advise that a separate Commission investigation - but related to the trade defence case in question &ndash; may be conducted to assess whether market conditions in the Union at present permit the suspension of measures for a period of up to 9 months should a decision be taken that definitive duties be imposed. The suspension of measures is permitted in cases where current market conditions do not reflect the market conditions in place during the Commission's "investigation period". Supply-chain issues and higher pricing as a result of COVID-19 having a negative impact on the availability of a range of products in the EU market is well understood by my Department. Therefore, if such an investigation is conducted by the Commission which results in a recommendation to suspend the imposition of measures - were such definitive measures carried - the Trade Defence team will assess the recommendation based on the Commission's report and the information received from industry to date.  In this regard, my Department's Trade Policy Unit is happy to remain engaged with industry representatives and are contactable at trade@enterprise.gov.ie. </p></reply>

The money raised from the levy is paid, via suppliers, to qualifying generators eligible for support under a number of Government schemes including the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff (REFIT) schemes.For customers connected to the electricity distribution system, the PSO Levy collected by electricity suppliers is passed to the Distribution System Operator (DSO) and then from the DSO to the Transmission System Operator (TSO). For transmission-connected customers the levy is passed directly to the TSO. The TSO then pays out the appropriate PSO Levy amounts, as instructed by the CRU, to the relevant market participants.</p><p>The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Public Service Obligations Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002). Under this legislation, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is responsible for the calculation of the levy each year and ensuring that the scheme is administered appropriately and efficiently. </p><p>The CRU requires that the annual submission of claims from supply companies for the recovery of PSO related costs be accompanied by an independent auditor&rsquo;s report.

The electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within a European Union regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets, including the matters raised by the Deputy, is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999. The CRU is an independent statutory regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions to the Oireachtas.In line with long standing policy on deregulating price setting, CRU ended its regulation of retail prices in the electricity market in 2011, and in the gas market in 2014. Given that prices are no longer regulated, they are set by all suppliers as entirely commercial and operational matters by them. Each such company has its own different approach to pricing decisions over time, in accordance with factors such as their overall company strategic direction and developments in their cost base.</p><p>The policy position of successive Governments, has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices and to support competition to drive down prices. Data from approved price comparison sites shows that consumers can make significant savings by switching energy suppliers.In terms of supports for small business owners, the supports  - focussed more towards SME&rsquo;s - are the following:</p><p>- Support Scheme for Energy Audits. It supports SMEs with a &euro;2,000 voucher towards the costs of a professional energy audit.</p><p>- The Communities Energy Grant (CEG) Scheme. It makes grant funding available for community-based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area. </p><p>- Training (SEAI Energy Academy), information and advisory service, access to energy auditing services and case studies of best practice.</p><p>Full details on these and other supports are available are available at  www.seai.ie/business-and-public-sector/.</p></reply>

Budget 2022 provided for &euro;202 million in funding to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for the operation of a range of schemes aimed at supporting homeowners as well as communities to upgrade their buildings and facilities to high standards of energy efficiency and renewable energy usage, thereby reducing fossil fuel usage, energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions.   The Communities Energy Grant scheme (CEG) supports community-oriented projects based on cross-sectoral, partnership approaches that deliver energy savings to a range of building types across public, commercial and community buildings, including the retail sector, with a particular focus on using the projects to deliver home retrofits. </p>  <p>  A new call for CEG projects for 2022 will issue from the SEAI shortly.

To this end, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) prioritised funding allocations for 2022 to achieve the following outcomes:</p>  <p>  1. Maintenance of existing national road assets, helping to maintain them to a safe and robust standard;</p>  <p>  2. Progression of projects currently under construction and those close to construction, such as the N5 Westport to Turlough project and the Dunkettle Interchange upgrade;</p>  <p>  3. Progression of the three major projects pre-Decision Gate 2 in the Public Spending Code (PSC), namely the N6 Galway Ring Road, N21/N69 Foynes to Limerick and M28 Cork to Ringaskiddy projects;</p>  <p>  4. For projects further back in the development pipeline, prioritise any remaining funds for projects that provide for local bypasses/"'Town Centre First"/Compact Growth.</p>  <p>  This builds on the large-scale investment in national roads that has taken place over the last 20 years, which has greatly improved regional connectivity.</p>  <p>  As regards regional and local roads, the original NDP identified 12 strategic road improvement schemes for development, subject to necessary approvals. To date 6 of these schemes have been completed and following approval last year the construction of 3 of the larger schemes is underway, i.e. the Coonagh to Knockalisheen Distributor Road, the Athy Southern Distributor Road and the Shannon Crossing, Killaloe Bypass and R494 Upgrade scheme.  Planning and design work is continuing on the remaining schemes.</p></reply>

Under the National Development Plan &euro;1bn has been allocated to specific carbon reduction measures, including vehicle electrification. </p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years. A national charging infrastructure strategy is being developed which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030. My Department is engaging with relevant stakeholders to inform this work and it is envisaged that the strategy will be published for consultation in early 2022.</p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point  infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. I would be very happy to consider any applications from Clare County Council under this scheme.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at www.lgma.ie/en/publications/general-publications/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf </p>  <p>  Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open in the near future.</p>  <p>  There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p>  <p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels, visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

Secured properties remain in the ownership and control of their registered owners, or appointed receivers where applicable. These parties are responsible for all matters relating to the management of secured properties, including engagement with State agencies who may have an interest in the property. </p>  <p>  I am advised by NAMA that its debtors and receivers have engaged with the OPW on numerous occasions regarding properties which were secured to NAMA. In some cases, this engagement resulted in secured assets being leased or sold to the OPW by the debtor/receiver however, NAMA, as mortgage holder, was not directly involved in any engagement between the parties. Under sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA is unable to divulge confidential information regarding NAMA debtors or their assets, or transactions in which they are involved. It is therefore not possible to identify the particular assets which were leased or sold to the OPW as to do so would identify the owners as NAMA debtors. In the event that there was a sale of any loans secured by property leased to the OPW, I am advised that this would not have impacted the ownership or tenancy of the secured property.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the foregoing, I am advised that NAMA, following reasonable searches of its records, has identified meeting with the OPW on at least two occasions in relation to assets which were secured to the Agency: </p>  <p>  - In respect of one of these assets, which was subject to litigation between the debtor and OPW, NAMA met with the OPW and Department of Housing in January 2012 at the request of the Department of Finance to see if the litigation could be resolved. The matter was subsequently resolved between the debtor and the OPW after High Court proceedings.</p>  <p>  - In respect of another Dublin city centre property secured to NAMA, NAMA and the appointed receiver met with the OPW in October 2015. At that time, the OPW owned the adjoining property and the engagement related to the submission of concurrent planning applications for the two adjoining properties.</p></reply>

This includes various statutory Codes of Conduct issued and amended by the Central Bank, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012, Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears 2013, Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Regulations 2016, and Fitness and Probity Standards (including minimum competency requirements).</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that, within the remit of its responsibilities for safeguarding stability and protecting consumers, its approach to debt resolution is focused on ensuring the fair treatment of borrowers through a strong consumer protection framework and ensuring that regulated entities have appropriate arrears resolution strategies and operations in place.  </p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code) sets out the requirements that regulated firms must comply with when dealing with consumers in order to ensure a similar level of protection for consumers, regardless of the type of financial services provider. The Code specifies that regulated firms must, at all times, act &lsquo;honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers and the integrity of the market&rsquo; and that they do not &lsquo;exert undue pressure or undue influence on a customer&rsquo; </p>  <p>  In relation to a mortgage loan which is secured on a primary residence, the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears 2013 (the CCMA) provides a strong consumer protection framework, requiring relevant firms to ensure that borrowers who are in arrears or pre-arrears are treated in a transparent and fair manner.  </p>  <p>  Where an Alternative Repayment Arrangement (ARA) is offered to the borrower, the regulated entity must inform the borrower of the reasons why the ARA offered is considered appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances. Where the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed, in line with Provision 40 of the CCMA, any change to the ARA must be appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances.  </p>  <p>  Where the entity does not offer an ARA, for example where it is concluded that the mortgage is not sustainable and an ARA is unlikely to be appropriate, the entity must provide the reasons on paper or another durable medium to the borrower, as well as other relevant information including other options available to the borrower and an estimate of associated costs or charges where known and, where not known, a list of the associated costs or charges. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the arrears handling provisions in Chapter 8 of the Consumer Protection Code apply when the loan is not a loan which falls within the scope of the CCMA. The Code requires that regulated entities have in place written procedures for the handling of arrears. Where an account is in arrears, a regulated entity must seek to mutually agree an approach that will assist the personal consumer in resolving the arrears.   </p>  <p>  Specified information in relation to arrears must be made available to personal consumers, including general information to encourage the consumer to deal with arrears and stating the benefits of dealing with arrears.  </p>  <p>  If the debtor is not happy with the service they receive from a credit servicing firm or any other regulated entity, they have the right to complain to that firm. The firm will handle the complaint in accordance with its complaints handling process. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 also includes rules that firms must follow when they handle the complaint. If the complaint is not resolved to the consumer&rsquo;s satisfaction, they can refer the complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, where they are an &lsquo;eligible consumer&rsquo; covered by that Scheme. Further details on the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman can be found on www.fspo.ie.</p>  <p>  More generally, details on the protections and options available to a borrower or any other debtor under Irish personal insolvency legislation can be found at isi.gov.ie.  This aspect of the framework of protections for individuals (including mortgage borrowers) is overseen by the Insolvency Service of Ireland and falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice. </p></reply>

and</p><p>-  identify areas where existing resources within the OPW may need to be strengthened, organisational and management structures re-aligned and working methods changed, bearing in mind the ongoing limitations on the overall resources available to the OPW and across the public service.</p><p>The recommendations contained in the C&amp;amp;C Review covered areas such as customer engagement, portfolio planning, project management resources, cost reduction, value release strategies, potential service delivery models, charging regimes, service level agreements, organisation models, process review, performance management and expertise, among others.  A Business Transformation Unit was established in 2014 to oversee the change management process, to be determined, arising from the recommendations in the C&amp;amp;C Review. </p><p>Following the extensive consultations on the recommendations that followed, the OPW determined a range of actions to be implemented, to reflect the C&amp;amp;C findings and recommendations in line with the Programme for Government and the actions arising from the PAMDP.  </p><p>In that regard, a significant reorganisation and restructuring of the Estate Management area was undertaken to realign structure to project planning and delivery functions.  The following recommendations in the C&amp;amp;C Review were implemented:</p><p>-  The appointment of a senior manager at Assistant Secretary level to oversee the Estate Management function within the office.  This included a restructuring and re-organisation of the OPW&rsquo;s activities and functions to support planning and delivery of its capital projects and of its property related commitments. </p><p>-  The establishment of a Project Oversight Group, chaired by the Chairman of the OPW, to oversee the management, assignment and implementation of intermediate and major capital projects and programmes of work; together with the establishment of a project pipeline planning process to inform the work of the Oversight Group;</p><p>-  The reorganisation of the capital project management area into Intermediate and Major projects, with project assignment to these areas dependent on scale and cost of each project;  </p><p>-  The establishment of a Governance and Evaluation Unit to support senior managers in relation to the requirements of the Public Spending Code;</p><p>-  The establishment of a Portfolio Planning Unit<b></b>, made up of additional qualified property personnel to facilitate more in-depth strategic portfolio planning, property option appraisals along with identifying potential opportunities in the market, in consultation with the Property Advisory (Valuation) Services in the OPW;</p><p>-  A review of the resources in the OPW&rsquo;s Property Advisory (Valuation) Service in 2017/2018, whereby additional professional Valuers were recruited and a dedicated team assigned to the Dublin area; </p><p>-  The development of an overall Estate Management Strategy<b></b>to provide a high level framework for a coordinated planning approach of the functions covered within the Estate Portfolio Management area; and to take account of any future alternative funding models that may arise from the engagement with the NDFA;</p><p>-  Ongoing engagement with the NDFA<b></b>to examine the availability of alternative funding<b></b>models that could provide for greater flexibility in funding opportunities in the market, combined with reinvesting in the portfolio through targeted property disposals;</p><p>-  The establishment of a property Acquisition and Disposals Committee<b></b>to identify potential strategic acquisitions, matched with planned disposals (to re-invest disposal income); </p><p>-  Strengthened processes relating to structured multi-disciplinary option appraisals<b></b>and the completion of business cases on significant acquisition proposals, in line with the Public Spending Code; </p><p>-  Strengthened sign-off on property acquisitions with an independent verification<b></b>of Heads of Terms agreed on leasehold or freehold acquisitions to ensure alignment between the agreed Heads of Terms and the final legal documentation;</p><p>-  The ongoing implementation of an Integrated Workplace Management System, to consolidate and streamline the range of property-related information held across the organisation.  The property maintenance element of this system is now live and it is expected that end user testing of the property management element will be complete and the system will go live in mid-2022;  </p><p>-  The hosting of regular Accommodation Workshops with client Departments, in light of the OPW&rsquo;s intelligent client role, in addition to hosting an Annual Accommodation Officers Network Conference.  </p><p>-  In parallel with the above, the OPW supports both formal educational and professional development programmes for staff and ensures that experiential learning opportunities are provided, in keeping with HR best practice.</p><p>As with all organisations, the reform process in OPW is not a static, point-in-time exercise but an ongoing, evolving process.  The process responds to emerging Government, environmental and market demands as well as the ongoing Civil Service Reform agenda, staff requirements and union agreements.</p><p>The reform initiatives in OPW positioned the organisation particularly well in the past 2 years in the context of major delivery programmes around Brexit and the national Covid emergency. </p></reply>

In addition to deploying intrusion protection systems, software vulnerabilities are managed by maintaining up-to-date versions. </p>  <p>  The vulnerability referenced in the question was identified by my Department on Friday 10th December. In accordance with current standard operational procedures my staff immediately began to examine the Department&rsquo;s internal and external facing systems in a coordinated fashion to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Vendors of key software applications, equipment, and services were consulted to identify any potential issues with their applications, equipment or services. The recommendations that were detailed in advisory alerts issued by the National Cyber Security Centre on the vulnerability were followed which included checking through system logs for exploits and ensuring that mitigation measures such as applying security patches were put in place.</p>  <p>  There were no unplanned stoppages of my Department&rsquo;s online or other services and there is no evidence to indicate that any computers, devices or services were compromised by the vulnerability.</p>  <p>  No additional costs have arisen to date to address the vulnerability.

High level goals focus on developing user-centred services; developing an innovative culture and mind-set; scaling up innovations across the public service; and engaging in transformative innovation using new and emerging technologies. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Innovation Strategy, the Reform Division of my Department has developed a number of resources and supports to enable public bodies to develop their own Innovation Strategies as well as an Innovation Scorecard which supports public bodies to measure and improve their innovation capability. </p>  <p>  The Reform Division provides ongoing support, initiatives and learning and development opportunities to public service bodies to assist them in developing innovation capacity, to encourage collaboration and to promote best practice across the public sector.  Some examples include:</p>  <p>  - The Public Service Innovation Fund provides funding to projects that encourage new ways of working and the use of experimental or emerging technologies.</p>  <p>  - The Public Service Innovation Network enables connections between people, teams and organisations to share ideas, experiences and best practice.  </p>  <p>  - Embedding Robotic Process Automation and other intelligent automation technologies across government through a simplified procurement framework developed by DPER. This technology proved to be pivotal in the Covid-19 response in areas like the HPSC and the development of the PUP.</p>  <p>  - Learning and Development interventions to hundreds of public servants in innovation-related modules and principles of design thinking. </p>  <p>  In respect of the domestic economy, boosting productivity is key to ensuring the competitiveness of Irish enterprises, and investment in research, development and innovation is known to boost firm-level productivity and aggregate economic performance.  Government support for public and private sector investment in digital skills and technology, research, development and innovation, allows Irish enterprises to seize opportunities to develop innovative new products and services to allow them to survive and thrive in competitive domestic and international markets. </p>  <p>  The EU Innovation Scoreboard shows Ireland is considered a strong innovator, now ranked eleventh in the European Union, but the Government has ambitions to do more and make Ireland a Global Innovation Leader. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the development of a new national strategy for research and innovation is a key commitment in the Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan 2021, which sets out the &ldquo;dual ambition of placing research, development and innovation at the heart of addressing Ireland&rsquo;s economic and societal challenges, and building capacity and capability across the research and innovation system to move research and innovation up the value chain.&rdquo; The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are leading the development of this new national strategy, in consultation with key Government Departments, agencies and stakeholders. The new Strategy will be published in 2022. </p>  <p>   I can also advise the Deputy that my Department is currently engaging with stakeholders to develop the next framework for Public Service Reform which will further contribute to improved performance across our Public Service. I expect this framework to be published later this year. </p></reply>

This expenditure, to fund temporary measures to address the impact of the pandemic, has been dealt with separately from expenditure on the delivery of core programmes and infrastructure and the careful phased withdrawal of this spending is essential both to support society and the economy to recover from the impact of Covid-19 and to return our public finances to a sustainable position. </p>  <p>  Some &euro;30 billion in direct expenditure supports has been made available across 2020 and 2021 and Budget 2022 outlined provision for up to &euro;7 billion in Covid-19 related spending, with &euro;3.1 billion of this already allocated to continue support measures. A further &euro;3.9 billion is held in reserve to allow Government flexibility to respond to continued impacts of the pandemic during 2022, targeting supports at where they can have the greatest impact. </p>  <p>  Along with the funding provision for Covid-19, significant increases in core expenditure have also been provided for 2022, in line with the sustainable level of increased expenditure set out under the agreed medium term expenditure strategy to 2025.  Core current expenditure in 2022 is projected to grow by &euro;3.1 billion, about 4.6%, relative to the core expenditure position set out for 2021 in Expenditure Report 2022, while the Expenditure Report outlined growth of &euro;1.1 billion or 11.7% in core capital expenditure allocations. Ensuring value for money from this expenditure is an ongoing priority of my Department. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to continuing reform and improvement of the budgetary process, including an enhanced focus across Government on issues of performance and national well-being. This will build on a range of reforms introduced in recent years to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s budgetary framework and ensure that expenditure is managed in an efficient, effective and strategic way. This ongoing work includes the &lsquo;whole-of-year&rsquo; budgetary framework, the Spending Review process, Performance Budgeting and Equality Budgeting and the development of the Wellbeing Framework for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Managing expenditure within their respective allocations is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister, particularly given the level of funding being provided, and careful monitoring of spending against profile and of progress on programmes and projects will continue to be required. Spending figures are compiled monthly and published in the Fiscal Monitor to report on spend against profile for all Ministerial Vote Groups. My Department engages on an ongoing basis with all Departments and will continue to monitor and develop our budgetary process with a view to ensuring that value for money is delivered across Government projects and programmes.</p></reply>

It is also central to responding to the challenges as well as the opportunities arising from Brexit. </p><p>The relevant sectoral strategies here are the National Aviation Policy, the National Ports Policy and the Telecommunications chapter of the National Marine Planning Framework which relates to international telecommunications connectivity. These strategies play a critical role in identifying the goals and priorities for the sector and are therefore critical in informing the investment projects set out in the NDP.  </p><p>The Projects and Programmes Tracker was also updated amongst other publications with the launch of the NDP; this provides detailed information about the progress made on the implementation of Government&rsquo;s investment priorities under Project Ireland 2040, including in relation to connectivity.  the tracker is available on gov.ie/2040.</p><p>Reforms are ongoing in governance and broader capability to help ensure successful delivery of Project Ireland 2040 - these reforms are set out in more detail here -</p><p>- The Project Ireland 2040 Delivery Board, comprises Secretaries General of the major capital spending department and oversees the delivery of the NDP. The Delivery Board will be extended shortly with up to 5 new members to bring additional expert knowledge, independent and regional perspectives, and an enhanced challenge function.</p><p>- Departments, Agencies and Public Bodies are constantly seeking to ensure that they have the necessary resources in place in terms of staff, structures and skills to deliver on their commitments. There are a number of ongoing measures which seek to further develop the capacity of the public sector over the coming period and ensure the effective delivery of the NDP. These include:</p><p>- ongoing work by the Commercial Skills Academy in the Office of Government Procurement</p><p>- the establishment of the Public Infrastructure Network (the InfraNet) for those involved in capital project delivery;</p><p>- expansion of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES); </p><p>- a range of reforms in the planning area including the establishment of a new Division of the High Court dealing with planning and environmental issues and </p><p>- the commissioning of the Supporting Excellence report through the EU Structural Reform Support Programme to review the capability of the public service to deliver the capital programme. On foot of one of the recommendations in that report, my Department convened an Action Team comprising of internal/external experts to tailor and set out a roadmap for implementation of the proposed solutions in more detail. The Supporting Excellence Action Team published their report alongside the National Development Plan 2021-30. The Action Team&rsquo;s report includes 34 specific actions aimed at supporting excellence in boosting capability in individual sectors; from the centre, and improving co-ordination and guidance to support excellence on a system wide basis. The implementation of the 34 actions in 2021 is being overseen by a Supporting Excellence Leadership Group.  </p><p>The Public Spending Code (PSC) sets the value for money requirements and guidance for evaluating, planning and managing capital projects. Management and delivery of investment projects and public services within allocation and the national frameworks is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister. </p><p>The update of the Public Spending Code in 2019 combined with lessons learned from domestic projects and international best practice highlighted the need for more structured scrutiny of major public investment projects, particularly in the areas of planned delivery, costings and risk. This is to ensure that Government is making decisions with a full picture of the proposal, its costs, risks and benefits.</p><p>In order to achieve this, my Department has introduced two key reforms:</p> <blockquote> 	- The introduction of an External Assurance Process (EAP) to provide independent project scrutiny at key decision stages. The EAP for major public capital projects (projects which cost in excess of &euro;100m) will focus on issues such as cost, risk and ability to deliver, at two key points in the project lifecycle, Decision Gate 1 (Approval in Principle) and Decision Gate 2 (Pre-Tender Approval).<br /><br />-A new Major Projects Advisory Group (MPAG) has been established to further strengthen project management. As a prerequisite to seeking Government approval for projects at the relevant decision gates, project proposals and external reviews will be scrutinised by the MPAG in advance of the decision to proceed. The new arrangements bring Ireland into line with leading international performers and meet a recommendation of the IMF&rsquo;s Public Investment Management Assessment of Ireland.  </blockquote>  <p>These reforms, alongside ongoing engagement with the construction sector regarding capacity and innovation, will help ensure the effective delivery of Project Ireland 2040 on time and on budget.</p></reply>

The National Public Procurement Policy Framework (NPPPF) sets out the overarching policy which consists of five strands:</p>  <p>  1. Legislation (Directives, Regulations)</p>  <p>  2. Government Policy (Circulars etc.)</p>  <p>  3. Capital Works Management Framework for Public Works and Construction related Services</p>  <p>  4. General Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Services</p>  <p>  5. More detailed technical guidelines, template documentation and information notes as issued periodically by the Policy Unit of the Office of Government Procurement (OGP)</p>  <p>  To create a level playing field for all businesses across Europe, EU law sets out minimum harmonised public procurement rules. These rules govern the way public authorities and certain utility operators purchase goods, works and services. The rules are set out in three principal EU Directives which are transposed into national legislation and apply to tenders for public contracts whose monetary value exceeds certain thresholds. For tenders of lower value, national rules apply, which must also respect the general principles of EU law.</p>  <p>  All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the Government's capital plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).  The CWMF is a structure that has been developed to deliver the Government&rsquo;s objectives in relation to public sector construction procurement reform. It consists of a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts, generic template documents and procedures that cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their procurement requirements.</p>  <p>  A review of the CWMF commenced in March 2019 and is ongoing. The focus of the review is on improving the delivery of construction projects in terms of quality, timely delivery and cost outcomes. The Review process involves extensive engagement both with industry and public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects on a broad range of issues including the deployment of digital technologies, enhanced risk management and information management for public bodies, contractors and consultants.</p>  <p>  To mitigate the impact of the necessary public health measures on the delivery of projects under the NDP, a series of COVID-19 notes were published during the period March 2020 to July 2021.  These included guidance notes, supplemental agreements for site closures and ex-gratia scheme, and a COVID-19 Mandatory Closure clause in Public Works Contracts.</p>  <p>  Engagement with the insurance sector and construction industry stakeholders has also taken place on issues relating to cost increases on Professional Indemnity Insurance premiums and the reduction in cover available.  Amendments to CWMF documents and additional guidance will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  Significant increases in construction material costs is impacting live tenders and contracts. Interim measures to address the impact of the cost increases on Public Works Projects have been introduced. Procurement guidance for &lsquo;live&rsquo; tenders was published in November 2021. Interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts were published in January 2022. </p>  <p>  Together these reform processes will lead to meaningful policy change and will assist in delivering better value for money for the taxpayer in the implementation of Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  The NPPPF also supports contracting authorities when awarding contracts for goods and services, including the Office of Government Procurement, four key sectors (Health, Education, Local Government and Defence), individual Departments, Offices, commercial and non-commercial State bodies, and private entities which are subsidised 50% or more by a public body,  and facilitates compliance with EU and National Procurement Rules.  </p>  <p>  My officials are currently finalising a review of the Procurement Guidelines for Goods and Service which were last updated in 2019 to take account of new developments in the area of procurement and clarification of some aspects of the Guidelines. In addition, an updated Brexit Information Note was published in July 2021 and an updated COVID Information Note was published in September 2021.</p>  <p>  Work has been undertaken by the OGP to ensure that the opportunity to compete in public procurement is accessible by all businesses, including SMEs. Specifically, the OGP has developed a suite of policy measures aimed at assisting SMEs to access public procurement opportunities (implemented through Circular 10/2014: Initiatives to assist SMEs in public procurement). These include:</p>  <p>  - Proportionate financial capacity criterion (turnover requirements limited to twice the contract value);</p>  <p>  - Contracting authorities are encouraged to divide public contracts into lots;</p>  <p>  - Provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale;</p>  <p>  - Proportionate insurance levels; and</p>  <p>  - Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal.</p>  <p>  The SME Advisory Group meets quarterly and ensures that the voice of Irish SMEs (through the industry representative bodies ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) is heard by Government. Furthermore, the OGP operates the Tender Advisory Service, an informal service provided free of charge, to facilitate suppliers to raise concerns in relation to live tender processes.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to proactively review the National Public Procurement Policy Framework periodically, update as appropriate and communicate changes to relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

The original closing date for applications was 12 February 2021 but, in view of difficulties some applicants were encountering as a result of Covid restrictions, this deadline was extended until 1 March 2021.  By this closing date, 3,106 applications had been submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.</p><p>The scoring system and assessment procedures were finalised and published prior to assessment work commencing and all applications were assessed in accordance with these procedures. </p><p>Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on 6 August 2021.</p><p>In relation to the remaining capital SCEP applications, the initial assessment of all applications was completed last week. In accordance with our objective of making the whole application process as user-friendly as possible, applicants who did not submit fully correct applications were given a two week period to submit corrected documentation. It should be noted that the number of applicants needing to avail of this &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; correcting facility was significant with a total of 706 applicants contacted in this regard. This represented 34% of the total capital applications. I am committed to having the final list of successful grants announced as soon as possible after the final date for receipt of corrected documentation.</p><p>In relation to the funding available to allocate, I am pleased that following completion of the 2022 budget discussions, an amount of &euro;34.535m has been provided for the SCEP in 2022. This represents an increase of &euro;6.6m on the 2021 allocation. In addition, the Revised Estimates for 2022 (REV 2022) provide for an amount of &euro;6m to be carried forward from 2021 meaning that at least &euro;40.5m will be available this year. This will cover all existing allocations under older rounds of the Programme plus significant new allocations which will be announced in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I am in discussions with my colleague Michael McGrath T.D. the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to maximising the total funding envelope available for the Programme and I expect to conclude that process shortly. Every effort will be made to fund as many worthwhile projects as possible while providing a sufficient level of grant to ensure the projects are viable<b>.</b></p><p>All unsuccessful applicants will be given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision and information in this regard will be issued when the grants are announced. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-01-20a.487.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012000083#WRL01100"><p>Increased participation in sport is a key objective of my Department. In the pursuit of that objective, we are committed to a Sport for All approach aimed at ensuring that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity, regardless of age, social-economic status, disability, or membership of, for example, the LGBTI+ community, the Traveller community or other ethnic minorities. Increasing participation amongst these groups is a core objective of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027, and will be essential to achieve the target of 60% of the population participating in sport and physical activity.</p>  <p>  At the end of November 2021, I launched a new Sports Action Plan covering the period up to the end of 2023, which includes a series of actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board including an Innovation Fund to promote innovative collaborative projects aimed at increasing sustainable participation in sport, an Inclusion, Diversity and Equality Fund, and a youth-centred stakeholder forum to guide the adoption of the strategic framework recommended in the Children&rsquo;s Sport Participation and Physical Activity Study 2018. The plan's emphasis is heavily orientated towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, work is underway to embed the Sport for All approach in other funding streams provided by my Department.  For example, Dormant Accounts funds that are specifically aimed at increasing participation levels amongst disadvantaged communities and people with a disability. Forthcoming rounds of funding will place further emphasis on the Sport for All approach. The total amount of funding being allocated for such projects this year is &euro;12 million, more than twice the amount available a number of years ago and representing a 20% increase on last year's provision.  </p>  <p>  One of the key aims of the national sports policy is to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport support entirely by 2027. The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor, ISM, report showed that the gender gap in sports participation was 3.4%, narrower than at any point over the past ten years. Unfortunately, while the ISM report for the first quarter of 2021 showed that the gender gap was eliminated during the Covid-19 restrictions, the latest ISM figures for quarter 3 showed that the gender gap was beginning to re-emerge as Covid-19 restrictions were lifted. In quarter 3 of 2021, male sport participation had returned to pre-pandemic levels, at 48%, while female participation was 38%, 7% behind the level measured in 2019.</p>  <p>  The emerging gradient is a cause for focus, concern and ongoing monitoring. It is now crucial that we move to ensure that the gap is narrowed and closed. To this end, many governing bodies will begin to deliver women in sport in dormant accounts funding programmes this winter which will actively target populations that have disproportionately been impacted by the pandemic, including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities. </p>  <p>  These targeted activities form part of a winter initiative for sport to kickstart participation following the reduction in restrictions. </p>  <p>  In May 2021, Sport Ireland published its Participation Plan 2021-2024 &ndash; Increasing Participation in Changing Ireland. The Participation Plan outlines how Sport Ireland will continue to help people get active by removing barriers to participation in sport and physical activity in the coming years. The Sport Ireland Participation Plan actions will be delivered through Local Sports Partnerships, National Governing Bodies, strategic partners, clubs, communities and individuals. </p>  <p>  The Sport Ireland Participation Plan is built on, and guided by, the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 (NSP) and the Sport Ireland Strategy 2018-2022. The Participation Plan takes into consideration Healthy Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013&ndash;2025 and the National Physical Activity Plan as well as global and national developments.</p></reply>

In response, my Department through the Creative Ireland Programme quickly developed partnerships to deliver a series of creativity-related, mental wellbeing initiatives throughout Ireland in support of older people. The Creativity in Older Age scheme has seen my department invest an additional nearly &euro;1.6 million in 2020 and 2021, including &euro;78,700 to local authorities in Carlow and Kilkenny.</p>  <p>  My overall approach to creative engagement for older people is also being informed by national and international research that has consistently pointed to the wellbeing benefits of participation in arts, culture and creativity.  The results of a newly-published report by The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) at Trinity College Dublin, which was commissioned by the Creative Ireland Programme in 2020, have shown that older adults who participated in creative activities enjoy a higher quality of life and were less likely to be lonely, depressed and stressed.</p>  <p>  In 2022, the Creative Ireland Programme will continue to work closely with partners across government investing in (i) community-led initiatives for older people through Creative Communities alongside, and (ii) more targeted creative engagement with older people from a health and wellbeing perspective.</p></reply>

The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media is responsible for coordinating its implementation.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan and the second annual progress report published recently, covering the 18 month period from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2020, present a clear overview of the 180 or so actions being advanced by c. 60 stakeholders in support of the language and Gaeltacht regions.  </p>  <p>  A copy of the Action Plan, together with the aforementioned progress report, can be found on the Department's website at www.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  I might also point out that an additional exchequer allocation of &euro;7m has been provided in Budget 2022 for the Irish language and Gaeltacht sectors, ultimately meaning that total funding in excess of &euro;85m is being deployed in support of the Irish language via my Department alone next year.</p>  <p>  A budget allocation of &euro;5.8m is being made available in 2022 to support the Language Planning Process.  This will enable my Department to fund both &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge who are tasked under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 with supporting the language planning process.  It will also enable my Department to support, at a central level, organisations which operate in the Early Years and Childhood, Family and Traditional Arts sectors as an additional support to the language planning process.  </p>  <p>  I should also add that my Department provides significant co-funding to Foras na Gaeilge to carry out its statutory mandate under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis. This funding, along with funding from the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland, enables Foras na Gaeilge to provide support, advice and financial assistance to many community language groups and to its six lead organisations who are working to promote the Irish language on an all-island basis.</p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy may be aware, the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 has recently been signed into law.  The primary purpose of the Act is to amend the Official Languages Act 2003 with a view to increasing and improving the provision of public services through the Irish language.</p>  <p>  I am confident that these key measures will continue to support and develop greater use of the Irish language both within Gaeltacht regions and nationally.</p></reply>

I recognise the essential role that the local media plays and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in sharing reliable and relevant local news and bringing communities together.</p>  <p>  Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have met key stakeholders including NewsBrands Ireland, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).  In relation to the local radio sector, I have received quarterly reports from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) analysing the impact of COVID-19 on the commercial radio sector.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers and local radio stations, such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. </p>  <p>  Support for the production of audiovisual and audio content for Irish audiences is provided through the Sound and Vision Scheme, which is established under the Broadcasting Act 2009, administered by the BAI. The Sound and Vision Scheme is funded through the allocation of 7% of net licence fee receipts per annum. Under section 156 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, I as Minister may allocate additional Exchequer funding to the Sound and Vision Scheme.</p>  <p>  In recognition of challenges facing the independent radio sector and its important contribution to society as a whole, in December 2020 I allocated additional funding of &euro;4.9 million for the Sound and Vision Scheme, &euro;2.5 million of which was to support the independent radio sector and &euro;1.4 million to support the live music sector. The &euro;2.5 million was awarded in April 2021 as part of a &euro;2.58 million Sound and Vision Scheme funding round to support all 32 radio stations in the independent radio sector. This funding was in additional to traditional Sound and Vision Scheme funding rounds. </p>  <p>  The loss the local media sector &ndash; newspapers and radio - has suffered from the impact of the restrictions has also been addressed by the public health advertising placed by the Government and HSE totalling at least &euro;17.14m from March 2020 to date. A breakdown of this spend is as follows: </p>  <p>  - &euro;6.71m on regional / local radio and &euro;3.67m on regional / local print in 2020, and</p>  <p>  - &euro;4.88m on regional / local radio and &euro;1.88m on regional / local print in 2021.</p>  <p>  I am also ensuring that advertising campaigns organised by my Department include a local print media element. Last year, the campaign for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, a day of free creative events for young people, included a spend of &euro;187,000 on local print advertising.</p>  <p>  My officials continue to engage with relevant stakeholders in order to explore the issues arising and build an understanding of the range of challenges facing the sector at present and appropriate solutions for the future.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The original closing date for applications was 12 February 2021 but, in view of difficulties that some applicants were encountering as a result of Covid restrictions, this deadline was extended until 1 March 2021.  By this closing date, 3,106 applications had been submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.</p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures were finalised and published prior to assessment work commencing and all applications were assessed in accordance with these procedures. </p>  <p>  Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on 6 August 2021.</p>  <p>  In relation to the remaining capital SCEP applications, the initial assessment of all applications was completed last week. In accordance with our objective of making the whole application process as user-friendly as possible, applicants who did not submit correct applications were given a two week period to submit corrected documentation. When assessing such a high volume of applications, the consistent application of the terms and conditions of the SCEP is paramount to delivering the Programme in a reasonable timeframe. It should be noted that this is only the second iteration of the Programme where applicants have been given the chance to correct their applications. Previously such applications were simply deemed invalid. </p>  <p>  I am committed to having the final list of successful grants announced as soon as possible. While revised documentation is not being accepted after the deadline date, I intend to give all unsuccessful applicants the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision. Information on how to submit an appeal will be issued to all applicants when the grants are announced. An announcement on the timing of a new round of the Programme will be made as soon as the appeals process is complete.  </p></reply>

The Taskforce undertook a public consultation process that garnered over 800 responses, including submissions from 60 organisations. This input helped guide and influence the key pillars of the report and informed the recommendations in terms of the survival and recovery phases for the sector.</p>  <p>  The Taskforce presented the Tourism Recovery Plan 2020 &ndash; 2023 to me in September 2020. The Plan makes a number of recommendations to help tourism businesses to survive, stabilise and recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. In December 2020, I appointed a Recovery Oversight Group, who report to me on a regular basis with updates on the implementation of the recommendations set out in the Recovery Plan and on the recovery of the sector.  </p>  <p>  I regularly meet with and remain open to engaging with a wide variety of tourism stakeholders and representative bodies. The Hospitality and Tourism Forum, which the T&aacute;naiste and I established, continues to provide a platform for structured engagement between the Hospitality and Tourism sectors, the tourism agencies and relevant Government Departments. The purpose of the Forum is to allow key issues to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by Government or by industry itself, to support the sectors. </p>  <p>  The tourism sector has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic so I was therefore pleased to secure a record level of funding for tourism in Budget 2022: &euro;288.5 million in total, an increase of &euro;67.5 million over the 2021 allocation. The allocation includes &euro;50 million for business continuity supports and a &euro;35 million increase to the Tourism Marketing Fund to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently announced indicative details of how the &euro;50m funding provided in Budget 2022 for the Tourism Business Continuity Programme will be allocated to assist strategic tourism businesses to recover in 2022. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has designed the programme to support those still experiencing the most difficulty as a result of the pandemic. The phasing of the programme has been set out to make sure that support is provided quickest to the businesses that need it most urgently and taking into account other Government funding that has already been received. The Strategic Tourism Transport Business Continuity Scheme opened for applications on 11th January 2022 and the Strategic Ireland Based Inbound Agents Tourism Business Continuity Scheme opened for applications on 12th January. The Attractions and Activity Tourism Operators Business Continuity Scheme will launch on 8th March and the Tourism Accommodation Providers Business Continuity Scheme will launch on 9th March.</p>  <p>  The Government recently agreed a number of changes to the major economy-wide support schemes available to businesses affected by the latest public health restrictions. Changes were made to the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) and the tax debt warehousing scheme to expand the supports available to businesses affected.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The resilience of these sectors, in the face of the extraordinary circumstances of COVID-19 has been remarkable, particularly as many were among the first sectors to close and are the last to return to full capacity.</p>  <p>  I am greatly heartened at the response to and uptake of the various supports, both horizontal and sectoral, that have been put in place.  Recognising that resilience and the hugely important role that these sectors play in Ireland's collective economic and social well-being, I will continue to work with the stakeholders to monitor the evolving situation and to work with my Government colleagues to support these sectors and, with officials and Government colleagues, to support a strong and stable recovery as we emerge from the pandemic.  </p>  <p>  We all want to see a return to full capacities attending cultural and entertainment events and the rehabilitation of our hard-hit Night-Time Economy, but the pandemic has continued to pose challenges </p>  <p>  As a Government, our commitment to the sector is evidenced by recent funding allocations, among them &euro;25m to pilot a Basic Income Scheme for Artists; record Arts Council funding of &euro;130m and the recent announcement of a &euro;50 million funding package for the Live Performance Sector.</p>  <p>  In the development and delivery of supports, both I and my officials engage regularly with agencies and stakeholders through a dedicated forum established for this purpose.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 published earlier this year sets out the actions that my Department will take over the coming period to enrich the quality of life in Ireland through supporting the development of tourism, culture, arts, sports, media and Irish language.  In addition to their immense inherent value, these are valued by all of our communities as important resources for social cohesion, individual and community wellbeing and for the presentation of Ireland as an attractive destination for tourism and sustainable inward investment. </p>  <p>  In addition to the core Departmental goals set out in this document, a number of cross cutting-goals have been incorporated into the Department&rsquo;s objectives which will be reflected in our policies and programmes over the lifetime of this Statement of Strategy including supporting and promoting diversity, social inclusion and full and effective female participation across the Department&rsquo;s sectors and society in line with Programme for Government commitments. </p></reply>

Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1 billion. </p><p>On 30 November 2020, Minister Martin and I announced that a new round of the Programme was opening with at least &euro;40 million available to allocate. The original closing date for applications was 12 February 2021 but, in view of difficulties some applicants were encountering as a result of Covid restrictions, this deadline was extended until 1 March 2021.  By this closing date, 3,106 applications had been submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding.  This is the highest number of applications ever received.</p><p>The scoring system and assessment procedures were finalised and published prior to assessment work commencing and all applications were assessed in accordance with these procedures. </p><p>Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for 'equipment-only' projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6m were announced on 6 August 2021.</p><p>In relation to the remaining capital SCEP applications, the initial assessment of all applications was completed last week. In accordance with our objective of making the whole application process as user-friendly as possible, applicants who did not submit fully correct applications were given a two week period to submit corrected documentation. It should be noted that the number of applicants needing to avail of this &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; correcting facility was significant with a total of 706 applicants contacted in this regard. This represented 34% of the total capital applications. I am committed to having the final list of successful grants announced as soon as possible after the final date for receipt of corrected documentation.</p><p>In relation to the funding available to allocate, I am pleased that following completion of the 2022 budget discussions, an amount of &euro;34.535m has been provided for the SCEP in 2022. This represents an increase of &euro;6.6m on the 2021 allocation. In addition, the Revised Estimates for 2022 (REV 2022) provide for an amount of &euro;6m to be carried forward from 2021 meaning that at least &euro;40.5m will be available this year. This will cover all existing allocations under older rounds of the Programme plus significant new allocations which will be announced in the coming weeks. Furthermore, I am in discussions with my colleague Michael McGrath T.D. the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to maximising the total funding envelope available for the Programme and I expect to conclude that process shortly. Every effort will be made to fund as many worthwhile projects as possible while providing a sufficient level of grant to ensure the projects are viable  <b><i>.</i></b></p><p>All unsuccessful applicants will be given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision and information in this regard will be issued when the grants are announced. </p></reply>

The Plan sets out a number of measures designed to enable the creative potential of every young person, both within the formal education system and in informal or community settings.  While the Creative Youth Plan is wider than the arts, it embraces the arts as a mechanism through which children and young people can experience creativity.</p>  <p>  The Plan is implemented by my Department in partnership with the Department of Education, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Arts Council. Significant progress on the delivery of its objectives has been achieved to date, which has included the roll-out of a number of schools-based initiatives. </p>  <p>  Creative Schools, delivered by the Arts Council, has supported 652 schools to put arts and creativity at the heart of school life, through the development and implementation of their own creative plan, while strengthening the relationships between schools and the broader cultural and community infrastructure. Creative Clusters, delivered by my colleague Minister Foley, enables groups of up to five schools to collaborate on an innovative arts and creative project to address a common issue or challenge (299 schools to date). In 2021, Minister Foley announced a new initiative developed by the Department of Education, titled BLAST (Bringing Live Arts to Schools and Teachers), which will enable up to 489 new Arts-in-Education residencies in schools each year. Creative Youth has also provided funding support for 359 Creative Engagement grants operated by the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, Creative Youth has seen my Department form partnerships to further enhance creative and artistic engagement in schools. Programmes include Junk Kouture, working with students around creativity, fashion and recycled materials and The Big Idea which, in partnership with the Institute of Designers in Ireland, works with students to address problems and issues through creative problem solving and design thinking.</p>  <p>  Creative Youth supports Continuing Professional Development programmes for teachers at both primary and post-primary.  While its focus is wider than arts, it encompasses the arts and endeavours to ensure that children and young people enjoy the benefits from participation and exposure to the arts and creative activities. To date, 5,670 teacher professional learning experiences have been funded for the Arts in Junior Cycle while 1,267 teacher CPD places (and artists&rsquo; residencies in schools) have been funded via the Teacher/Artist Partnership.</p>  <p>  While my Department continues to support the Creative Youth initiatives referenced above in a collaborative manner across government, primary responsibility for engagement with the arts as part of the school curriculum rests with my colleague, Minister Foley.</p></reply>

This initiative seeks to encourage new access and maximise the potential of existing services to the regions, with matched funding from airlines, sea carriers, airports, ports and regional tourism stakeholders including Local Authorities. As Waterford Airport does not currently operate scheduled flights, Tourism Ireland is not in a position to leverage this funding in respect of access to the airport. Should scheduled flights resume at the airport, Tourism Ireland may again be in a position to support access routes through the fund. </p>  <p>  In relation to tourism in Waterford in general, F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to market Waterford extensively through the Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East Regional Experience Brand.  In addition, Waterford continues to feature heavily in F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Keep Discovering Campaign in press advertisements, TV and radio. </p>  <p>  I was pleased to secure a record level of funding for tourism in Budget 2022, including a &euro;30 million increase to the Tourism Marketing Fund to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland.  This will allow Tourism Ireland to roll out over &euro;80 million worth of marketing campaigns, in which Waterford will feature strongly, in key international markets.</p></reply>

Substantial funding is available to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver on this objective as the primary means through which they will increasingly meet the needs of those on their waiting lists.

The scheme will support first-time buyers on moderate incomes to buy a new-build home. The banking sector has confirmed it is committed to working with the State to develop and deliver this scheme. Budget 2022 allocated &euro;44m to my Department for First Home. The banking sector has agreed in principle to match State equity funding in order to increase the pool of funding available to potential new homeowners under the scheme.

Local authorities were asked to submit their Plans to me, to include social and affordable housing last month. This allows each local authority to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) and plan provision accordingly. It is possible for local authorities to undertake HNDA analysis at sub county level to determine whether there is a need for Government funded affordable housing schemes in specific towns/areas. </p>  <p>  In relation to the scheme governing the affordable purchase of local authority provided or arranged affordable housing, it is intended that regulations regarding income eligibility in respect of the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme will be in place very shortly. A Circular will issue to local authorities regarding these regulations thereafter. </p></reply>

Due to the complex nature of the Foreign Birth Registration process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of Foreign Birth Registration applications at this time. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of Foreign Birth Registration staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period. </p>  <p>  There are currently 32,000 applications for which documentation has been received, and which are awaiting processing. In 2021, over 7,000 Foreign Birth Registration applications were processed.  Foreign Birth Registration staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Applicants who require an emergency service may contact the Passport Service directly.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year. The Department has been actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit additional permanent and temporary staff for assignment to the Passport Service. This recruitment drive has been underway since the last quarter of 2021 and will double the number of staff in the Passport Service from June 2021 levels. Over 180 additional staff are being assigned to the Passport Service in January alone and further staff will be assigned in February.  I am confident that the additional staff currently being assigned to the Passport Service will help to reduce turnaround times and to respond to the current and anticipated high demand for passports and Foreign Birth Registration this year. </p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport and Foreign Birth Registration system.  Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports and Foreign Birth Registration. </p></reply>

The conflict is having a devastating impact on civilians with reported widespread human rights violations, while the number of casualties continues to rise. Over 9 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, including 5.2 million people in Tigray alone.</p>  <p>  Through our bilateral engagements, as well as within the European Union and at the UN Security Council, Ireland continues to advocate for full humanitarian access, an urgent end to violence, dialogue, accountability for atrocities, and ultimately a political solution to the conflict. We see the recent withdrawal of TPLF forces to Tigray from neighbouring regions as an opportunity for de-escalation and political dialogue which must be seized. </p>  <p>  We also welcome the recent decision of the Ethiopian authorities to release a number of opposition leaders. However, continued reports of air strikes in Tigray resulting in dozens of civilian casualties are deeply troubling and underscore the urgent need for ensuring full humanitarian access to the region. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been to the fore in raising the humanitarian and human rights situation at the UN Security Council, most recently on 20 December when members were briefed on the severity of the humanitarian crisis. We have also led negotiations resulting in two Security Council press statements on the crisis, the latest &ndash; on 5 November &ndash; called for humanitarian access, a ceasefire and political dialogue to resolve the crisis. </p>  <p>  Ireland also believes that regional leaders have a vital role to play in promoting peace. We have been vocal in our support for the ongoing mediation work of African Union Special Envoy Obasanjo, President Kenyatta and others. It is critical that we continue to push for urgency in these efforts.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s continued priority will remain, as always, supporting the needs of the most vulnerable people in Ethiopia, including those affected by conflict in Tigray. My Department, through the Irish Aid programme, recently disbursed an additional &euro;17 million to humanitarian partners operating in Ethiopia including UN OCHA, UNICEF, UNFPA, International Rescue Committee, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, bringing our total response to the extensive humanitarian needs in 2021 to almost &euro;25 million. We will continue to prioritise responding to humanitarian needs while this crisis persists.</p></reply>

Twenty seven United Nations Volunteers were fully funded by the Irish Government in 2020. These volunteers go on to share their expertise and influence in the UN, my Department and elsewhere in Ireland and abroad.</p><p>My Department also provides support to volunteer-sending organisations such as UCD Volunteers Overseas (UCDVO) and Suas.  In addition, Irish international volunteers are assisted by my Department through two specific schemes, the Public Service Pension Scheme for Volunteer Development Workers (PSPS) and the Volunteer Development Worker Scheme (VDWS).</p><p>The PSPS allows public servants, including teachers, to have their pension contributions paid while volunteering overseas while on an authorised leave of absence or career break from the public service.

Defence Ministers also received a short Current Affairs briefing which touched on topics such as the situation at the Ukrainian border and the European Security Architecture, as well as the situation in Mali.</p>  <p>  The working dinner, in which I participated, was also attended by United Nations Under-Secretary General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, as well as the Chair of the Sub-Committee of the European Parliament on Security and Defence (SEDE) Nathalie Loiseau MEP. The discussion focused on the threats posed by various mercenary groups - notably the Wagner Group - in Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Central African Republic for example, with the discussion invited to focus on the threats faced, ways to tackle it, and concrete proposals on how to strengthen CSDPs operational effectiveness in that context. I took the opportunity to express Ireland's deep concern at the increasing engagement of both State and non-State actors in a number of countries where the EU has been working to improve peace and security and their negative impact on CSDP missions and operations. The NATO Secretary General also took the opportunity to debrief EU Defence Ministers on that day's meeting of the NATO-Russia Council.</p>  <p>  The working session on 'Safeguarding the EU&rsquo;s strategic interests in contested domains: focus on outer space', took place in the framework of the ongoing work on the Strategic Compass, with discussions focusing on the increasing threats and challenges faced (in the context of an EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence); how to react to hostile behaviours in space, how to protect space related assets and how space services best serve security and defence, in particular situatioonal aware for our CSDP missions and operations.</p>  <p>  The joint working lunch between Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers focused on the first revised text of the Strategic Compass, which was presented to Ministers by the High Representative/Vice President, Josep Borrell. Ministers provided their first reactions to the revised text with a view to providing guidance for further work within the Council, to ensure that the Strategic Compass is both ambitious and actionable prior to its adoption in March. Ireland welcomed the progress on the Strategic Compass as set out in the revised draft and urged a continued emphasis on multilateralism and the importance of the EU-UN strategic relationship.</p>  <p>  The key strategic partners for the EU are the UN and NATO.  In respect of deepening European Union and NATO links, it is my view that as an active partner of NATO through Partnership for Peace, Ireland should continue to welcome EU-NATO co-operation where it benefits international peace and security and is focused on avoiding duplication of structures, systems and interoperability standards. This cooperation ensures better coherence and effectiveness on the ground in peace support and crisis management operations. It is fully acknowledged at EU level that any decisions made in the context of cooperation acknowledge the differing security policies of individual members of the EU and NATO, and are made in compliance with the decision-making autonomy and procedures of each organisation.  I should point out that NATO is also recognised by the UN as one of its strategic partners.  </p></reply>

From 11 January 2021 until schools reopened on 12 April 2021, all students, including students who are due to sit the Junior Cycle state examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools.</p>  <p>  The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context.</p>  <p>  The nature of distance learning, which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools in 2020 and 2021, required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils&rsquo; continuity of learning during that period. Assisted by Department-funded resources and supports, schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the unprecedented situation including the use of digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning.</p>  <p>  My Department put a series of measures in place to assist schools in mitigating the impact of the school closures.  During the period of school closure, schools were required to implement a plan of action to enable continuity of learning for all pupils.  This involved teachers, including special education teachers, providing remote teaching and learning to all pupils in their class or on their caseload.</p>  <p>  In September of 2021, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) published revised arrangements for the completion of Classroom Based Assessments for students in 3rd year in 2021/2022 (cohort of students 2019 &ndash; 2022). These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 and 2020/21 school year. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice in and reducing the number of Classroom-Based Assessments. The revised arrangements also remove the requirement for an Assessment Task to be completed.</p>  <p>  The adjustments were arrived at through consultation between my Department and the NCCA and key stakeholders. These revised arrangements are available here: ncca.ie/en/resources/revised-arrangements-for-the-completion-of-classroom-based-assessments-cbas-in-school-year-20212022-1/ </p>  <p>  Junior Cycle papers are structured to reflect the learning outcomes based approach to the design of the subject specifications. This means that the elements are used to integrate the strands of the specifications resulting in assessments that require students to apply knowledge and skills acquired rather than examinations that depend on knowledge recall only. Candidates are required to answer all questions and no choice is provided. Questions are not of equal length or marks. Making any changes to the format of the papers would undermine the approach taken by teachers in developing units of learning that mediate the curriculum specifications.</p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools. The assessment arrangements also provide progression opportunities for students who intend to pursue paths outside of school after Junior Cycle, such as those who may enter apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission will issue further details regarding the 2022 examinations. All aspects of the examinations will be conducted in accordance with the prevailing Public Health advice.</p>  <p>  It is planned that the Junior Cycle Music practical performance test and the Home Economics practical test will take place during school time as normal.</p>  <p>  By way of further information, my Department has provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool</p></reply>

Allocations are also provided for new schools which open each year.</p><p>DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019, stated that the allocations being made for 2019 would initially remain in place for a minimum of two years, following which, revised profiled allocations would be considered for schools from September 2021. </p><p>The NCSE Policy advice &lsquo;A Proposed new Model for Allocating Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs (2014)&rsquo; on which the SET allocation model is based, recommended that &lsquo;the additional teaching supports be left in place initially for a two-year period. As the new model becomes embedded in the system, this may be extended to three years.&rsquo;</p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Special Education and Inclusion have agreed to maintain the existing Special Education Teacher Allocations for schools for the 2021/22 school year, with re profiled allocations now due to be made from September 2022.</p><p>Additional allocations continue to be made for new schools, schools which achieve developing status, or for exceptional circumstances arising in schools, in the interim.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>There are now over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.</p><p>This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9740 teachers were allocated. </p><p>Maintaining the existing allocations of Special Education Teachers for the 2021/22 school year meant that schools did not have to engage in an extensive redeployment of posts, or re-clustering, this year.</p><p>It also provided schools with greater levels of certainty as to the staff that they would have in place for September.</p><p>No school saw a cut, or reduction, to their special education teaching support this year.</p><p>In circumstances where some schools saw a greater level of increase year on year, if full re profiling had occurred, the increased allocations for developing status combined with the existing allocation of the school saw an increased overall teacher allocation for these schools in 2021/22.</p><p>The allocations for 2021/22 which were maintained comprise the allocations made for schools from September 2019 plus any additionality achieved since plus any developing hours for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 school years.</p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review, they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/for-schools</p></reply>

My Department has been working closely with the State Examinations Commission (SEC) to put in place a number of measures to seek to take account of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p>  <p>   My Department will continue to engage with all partners in education on all matters relating to Leaving Certificate 2022 examinations. A meeting of the Advisory Group on State Examinations is planned for later this week. The group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers and school leaders, as well as representatives from the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, Higher Education and my Department. The group is co-chaired by my Department and the SEC.</p>  <p>  Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 state examinations that were announced in August 2021 were designed to take account both of the disruption to learning experienced by students in the early part of 2021, as well as providing for some possible further disruption in 2021/22. The adjustments ensure that the overall structure of the examinations remains intact but allows for greater choice for students.</p>  <p>  Revised arrangements for Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations in Irish and the Modern Foreign Languages and the practical performance tests in Leaving Certificate Music were announced last month. These examinations will take place outside of school time over the first week of the school Easter holidays. By moving these examinations to the Easter holidays, the State Examinations Commission  aims to minimise disruption to teaching and learning, especially for those candidates preparing for their examinations, as this change will limit teacher absence from schools.</p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission recently provided some further information to schools regarding aspects of the 2022 state examinations in light of the disruption caused by Covid-19. This included postponing commencement of assessment of the Leaving Certificate Applied February Tasks, from 31 January to 14 February. Schools were also reminded of the flexibility which is available regarding the dates for completion and authentication of Coursework for Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle candidates.</p>  <p>  An alternative set of Leaving Certificate examinations will be run in 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations, for students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations for various reasons, including Covid-19 illness, bereavement or serious illness.      </p>  <p>  As has been the case for the 2020 and 2021 state examinations, all planning for the 2022 Examinations will be guided by the prevailing public health advice and will have regard for the wellbeing of our students.</p></reply>

In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice. </p>  <p>  The admission policy, including the selection criterion to be used where the school is oversubscribed, must comply with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018, be non-discriminatory and be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  Where a board of management make a decision to refuse admission, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, and an independent appeals committee will be appointed to consider the appeal.  The role of the section 29 hearing committee is to examine the application for enrolment and consider if it was correctly processed by the school, in accordance with the school&rsquo;s Enrolment Policy. The section 29 appeals committee cannot consider matters that are not provided for within the school&rsquo;s Enrolment Policy. If a parent / Guardian  consider that a school has erred in their processing of their enrolment application, a section 29 appeal committee can examine how the application was processed by the school and identify if the school did not follow its enrolment policy.  In cases where an error occurred the section 29 appeal committee will consider if the error had a material effect on the application. Where an error had a material effect on the enrolment application, the section 29 appeal committee can direct the school to enrol the student or adjust the students ranking on the waiting list.   This Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned. </p>  <p>  A section 29 appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that if a student have been refused admission due to the school being oversubscribed, and the parent/ guardian  wish to appeal that decision the parent / Guardian  must firstly make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the student.</p>  <p>  If the student  have been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, the parent / Guardian  may, but are not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child. </p>  <p>  Where the student has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and do not choose to seek a review by the board of management the parent / Guardian  may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  Full details on the section 29 appeals process are available on the Gov.ie  website at the links below:</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/8248c-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-due-to-a-school-being-oversubscribed/</p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/publication/31c4f-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-for-a-reason-other-than-the-school-being-oversubscribed/</p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS), the Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency, is the legal body which can assist parents/guardians who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child.

A meeting of the Advisory Group on State Examinations is planned for later this week. The group includes representatives of students, who are represented by the Irish Second Level Students' Union, parents, teachers and school leaders, as well as representatives from the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, Higher Education and my Department.</p>  <p>   Adjustments to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 state examinations that were announced in August 2021 were designed to take account both of the disruption to learning experienced by students in the early part of 2021, as well as providing for some possible further disruption in 2021/22. The adjustments ensure that the overall structure of the examinations remains intact but allows for greater choice for students.</p>  <p>   Revised arrangements for Leaving Certificate Oral Examinations in Irish and the Modern Foreign Languages and the practical performance tests in Leaving Certificate Music were announced last month. These examinations will take place outside of school time over the first week of the school Easter holidays. By moving these examinations to the Easter holidays, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) aims to minimise disruption to teaching and learning, especially for those candidates preparing for their examinations, as this change will limit teacher absence from schools.</p>  <p>   The State Examinations Commission recently provided some further information to schools regarding aspects of the 2022 state examinations in light of the disruption caused by Covid-19. This included postponing commencement of assessment of the Leaving Certificate Applied February Tasks, from 31 January to 14 February. Schools were also reminded of the flexibility which is available regarding the dates for completion and authentication of Coursework for Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle candidates.</p>  <p>   An alternative set of Leaving Certificate examinations will be run in 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations, for students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations for various reasons, including Covid-19 illness, bereavement or serious illness.      </p>  <p>   As has been the case for the 2020 and 2021 state examinations, all planning for the 2022 Examinations will be guided by the prevailing public health advice and will have regard for the wellbeing of our students.</p></reply>

Once accepted onto the scheme the person retains100% of their original payment in year one and 75% in year two.</p>  <p>   In Budget 2022, I introduced a suite of measures designed to support people with disabilities:  </p>  <p>  - &euro;5 increase across core social welfare payments/rates,</p>  <p>  - Increase to the upper earnings disregard limit for Disability Allowance and the Blind Pension from &euro;350 to &euro;375 per week, effective from June 2022.</p>  <p>  - Increase to the rate of Wage Subsidy Scheme, (equivalent to 60% of National Minimum Wage). This is a financial incentive to encourage employers to employ jobseekers with disabilities.</p>  <p>  - Increase to the general weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance to &euro;7.60.</p>  <p>  - Increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 to &euro;33 per week. (The weekly means threshold was also increased by &euro;20 from &euro;100 to &euro;120. This represents a 20% increase and enables more people to qualify for this support),</p>  <p>  - Increase to the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3, from &euro;19 to &euro;22 per week. The Living Alone Allowance is an additional payment made each week to people aged 66 years or over who are living alone and in receipt of certain payments, including Disability Allowance and Blind Pension. </p>  <p>  My Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives, while any proposed changes have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has announced a wide range of measures to support the arts. Most recently, this has included the launch of funding of &euro;6.6 million for the 2022 Creative Ireland Programme - Creative Communities initiative. This partnership between the departments and all 31 local authorities will offer thousands of opportunities across Ireland for people of all ages to engage with creative projects in their local area.  In 2021 this enabled local authorities to deliver nearly 1,500 community-led creative projects. This funding has proved to be an important flexible resource that has enabled local authorities to sustain and develop vibrant creative communities.</p></reply>

The qualifying age for the CE service support stream (SSS) has been reduced from 62 to 60 and the 10% cap on the number of places in this stream  has been removed. This means that persons over sixty will be able to remain on CE until they reach retirement age. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware over the course of the pandemic, CE participants&rsquo; contracts were extended on a number of occasions, as an emergency support measure. This measure resulted in many contracts extending beyond the standard time limits..  The latest extension extended participants' contracts up to at least February 2022. After that date, participants with extended contracts, will start to leave schemes on a co-ordinated, phased basis over a prolonged period continuing up until January 2023. Departmental officials will work with local schemes on the timescale for the phased ending of these contracts. </p><p>To further assist with the transition from COVID emergency supports over the next period, participants, including those with extended contracts, may not be required to leave CE, where a suitable replacement has not yet been referred to the scheme. This transitionary provision will support schemes to retain important local community services, given the higher-than-normal turnover of participants in 2022 as extended contracts come to an end.</p><p>Officials from my Department will continue to work with and support all CE schemes throughout the transitionary period as the extended contracts come to an end. They will also continue to work with local CE sponsor organisations to identify suitable CE candidates.  Time spent on PUP will count towards eligibility for CE.  CE sponsor organisations are also encouraged by the Department to continue to promote the benefits of CE to long term unemployed persons in their local communities. </p><p>My priority and the priority of the Department is to have all CE schemes back providing normal services and supports to their long-term unemployed participants while delivering valuable services to local communities.  <b></b></p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

OMCs must set annual service charge schemes to cover the costs of maintenance, insurance and repair of common areas under its controls and the provision of common services to unit owners. The OMC must establish a sinking fund, and OMCs can also develop house rules for the operation and maintenance of their multi-unit development.</p>  <p>  In relation to annual service charges, it is a matter for each individual OMC to determine the amount of the service charge on an annual basis. Section 18 of the Act requires OMCs to establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges from which they may discharge expenditure incurred on the provision of common or shared services to the owners and occupiers of residential units in the development, including insurance, waste management and security services. The Act sets out clearly that the service charge must be calculated on a transparent basis, and be equitably apportioned between the residential unit owners. In order to ensure transparency and accountability, both the annual service charge and the services to be provided must be approved by a general meeting of the members of the OMC.</p>  <p>  In relation to meetings, Section 17 (1) (b) of the Act requires the OMC to hold a meeting at least once a year where they are obliged to present annual report. These meetings shall take place within reasonable proximity to the estate, and at a reasonable time. These obligations are in addition to any other obligation or duty such a company would have under legislation such as, the Companies Act 2014.</p>  <p>  Section 24 of the Act contains provisions for the resolution of disputes relating to multi-unit developments. It provides that a person, including any member of an OMC, may apply to the Circuit Court for an Order to enforce any rights conferred or obligations imposed by the Act. The Court, if satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, may make such remedial order as it deems appropriate in the circumstances with a view to ensuring the effective enforcement of the right or the effective discharge of the obligation. The Act also contains provisions which encourage the resolution of disputes that may arise between parties by means of mediation rather than recourse to court proceedings.</p>  <p>  More generally, statutory provisions governing the regulation of companies, including those concerning the memorandum and articles of association, the appointment and responsibilities of directors and requirements for submitting annual financial returns, are set out in the Companies Acts.</p></reply>

While you have a right to freedom of expression - you do not have a right to use it to incite others to hatred. There is no place for xenophobia and hate speech in our society.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I published the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill in April 2021. </p><p>The General Scheme will create specific, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic. These protected characteristics are race; colour; nationality; religion, ethnic or national origin; sexual orientation; gender; or disability.</p><p>The proposed new Bill will repeal and replace existing provisions on incitement to hatred contained in the 1989 Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act.</p><p>The new legislation will contain robust safeguards for freedom of expression, such as protections for reasonable and genuine contributions to literary, artistic, political, scientific or academic discourse, and fair and accurate reporting.</p><p>There will be explicit provisions in the legislation to protect reasonable and genuine contributions to fields such as political discourse, art and scientific research.</p><p>Our new legislation must respect the essence of the right to free expression. We must ensure that the limitations we, as a society, choose to place on freedom of expression by prohibiting incitement to hatred are needed in order to protect the rights and freedoms of others, and are effective in doing so.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that a National Anti-Racism Committee was established by Government in 2020 to draw up a National Action Plan Against Racism (NAPAR) for Ireland. This is in line with the commitment contained within the Programme for Government to publish a new NAPAR.  The Committee submitted an interim report to my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth last year and I understand the new National Action Plan Against Racism is currently being drafted for submission to Minister O'Gorman. </p></reply>

First time registrations outside of the Dublin area are processed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) through the Garda Station network and securing of those appointments with GNIB are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  The Registration Office of my Department registers permissions for those residing in the Dublin area.</p>  <p>  Since the onset of the pandemic, immigration permissions have been extended nine times, which means that people who held a valid permission to be in the State in March 2020 are legally permitted to remain until 31 May 2022.</p>  <p>  As a result of the unavoidable delays that have resulted from closures and the reduced capacity of the Registration Office during Covid-19, a high number of customers are now coming forward to seek an appointment. When the office is open, 50% of normal capacity or 200 first time registration appointments are permitted every day in the Registration Office of my Department. This is the maximum allowed under current public health guidelines, which are strictly adhered to for the safety of all staff and customers alike.</p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to meet the current unprecedented demand for first-time registration appointments, on 10 January 2022, a Freephone service (0800 741 741) was introduced for customers. It is currently operating 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday (8am to 8pm) and 8 hours a day on Saturday and Sunday (9am to 5pm). There are between 15 and 20 customer service representatives taking calls and making appointments. All appointments for persons to register their immigration permission are now issued through this service, with operators offering one appointment per call, unless it is for an identifiable family group.</p>  <p>  In the first week of operation, over 2,000 customers have received appointments booked through the Freephone service. On average, more than 425 customer appointments are confirmed each day and registration will take place as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Registration Office&rsquo;s customer service team is available to support customers who may have language difficulties or may need assistance with translation. A number of multi-lingual videos describing the registration process and what to expect are available on our website www.irishimmigration.ie.</p>  <p>  A new Immigration Service appointment and scheduling system, which will streamline and further improve the registration process, is currently being developed and is expected to be available to customers shortly. </p>  <p>  Dublin based customers seeking to renew their permission can continue to do so online at  inisonline.jahs.ie/user/login.</p></reply>

Additionally, increased budget allocations have been secured this year in order to address such heinous and unacceptable behaviour.</p><p>As you may be aware, I am currently leading work on a new whole of government strategy to combat domestic, sexual, gender-based violence. This new plan will have a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in our society for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p><p>The Strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals set out. The Deputy may be interested to know that Safe Ireland is one of two NGOs (the other is the National Women's Council of Ireland) that my Department has partnered with to provide expert support in relation to the development of the Strategy. This included examining how progress on actions is identified and reported, analysis of progress to date and of possible priority issues to be addressed, how drafting of actions should be approached, expert advice on moving to an outcome-focused framework, expert advice on the development of a prevention focused Strategy and support for wider public consultation. The process has been supported by external consultants, overseen and directed by an executive group consisting of the Department of Justice, the NWCI, and Safe Ireland.</p><p>The new Strategy will be structured around the four pillars or goals of the Istanbul Convention which are </p><p>- Prevention</p><p>- Protection</p><p>- Prosecution</p><p>- Co-ordinated Policies</p><p>Under each of these high level objectives there will be a number of specific aims listed but the Strategy and aims will be high level in tone and content. </p><p>A detailed action plan setting out how each of these aims will be achieved, who is responsible for them and the timeframe for delivery is currently being drafted with the sector so that it is targeted, ambitious and deliverable.</p><p>In the coming weeks, I will be inviting feedback through a focused consultation process on the final draft to ensure the Strategy is correctly emphasising the areas that people feel need the most attention. </p><p>I expect to bring the finalised strategy to Government in March, and I will oversee the implementation of the strategy. </p><p>Last year, on foot of the audit, it was agreed that the Department of Justice will continue to have lead policy responsibility for DSGBV.</p><p>My Department will also assume responsibility for services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, in addition to policy responsibility.</p><p>A detailed plan for how this will work is in preparation and will be brought to Government for decision.</p><p>Also this year, I will be introducing legislation to strengthen the law in a number of areas.</p><p>The new Garda Powers Bill will provide a clear and transparent statutory basis for the existing police powers of search, arrest and detention.</p><p>The Digital Recordings Bill provides for the necessary modern technology in the investigation of serious crime</p><p>Before Easter, I will publish a Bill which will include new criminal offences for stalking and for non-fatal strangulation.</p><p>The act of stalking itself is already covered by existing law, but I will propose the following changes to make the law clearer and stronger:</p><p>Explicitly reference stalking as a criminal offence;</p><p>- Make it clear that stalking includes watching or following a victim, even where they are not aware of being watched or followed;</p><p>- Make it clear that impersonating the victim, and then communicating with a third party, is illegal;</p><p>- Update the law to ensure that it covers all forms of modern communications.</p><p>- I will also consider introducing a provision to allow a victim, in very serious cases, apply to the court for an order to prevent the alleged perpetrator from communicating with them in advance of a trial. </p><p>While choking and non-fatal strangulation are already illegal, creating a new, standalone offence should encourage victims to come forward and report what has happened to them.</p><p>It has been shown that this crime can be an indication of future, lethal violence and is a risk factor for homicides against women in the home.</p><p>In the Summer, I will publish a new Hate Crime Bill which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender.</p><p>Before the end of September, I will publish a new Sexual Offences Bill, which will introduce important changes including:</p><p>Extending victim anonymity to further categories of victims</p><p>Repealing provisions for sentences to be delivered in public</p><p>Legal representation for victims</p><p>I will also seek to enact the Sex Offenders Bill within months to strengthen the management and monitoring of sex offenders in the community.</p><p>Within the coming weeks, I will sign an order to bring into operation legislation which provides for pre-trial hearings, which will significantly improve the trial process for victims of sexual offences.</p><p>This is an area of work I have prioritised since becoming Minister for Justice, but I know much more needs to be done, and I'm determined to do much more. </p></reply>

It&rsquo;s health consequences range from increased risk of premature death to serious chronic conditions that reduce the overall quality of life. </p><p>In Ireland 23% of the adult population are obese with 37% being overweight. In addition, 1 in 5 children are categorised as overweight or obese. </p><p>Obesity is a complex and multi-faceted problem, and the Department of Health&rsquo;s Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP) recognises this and that it needs a multi-pronged solution, with every sector of society playing its part.  An important strand of the OPAP relates to communications. Step 4 of the OPAP is to Implement a strategic and sustained communications strategy that empowers individuals, communities and service providers to become obesity aware and equipped to change, with a particular focus on families with children in the early years.  Action under this heading has included the funding for the START public health childhood obesity campaign (www.safefood.net/start) and the currently running Healthy Ireland Let&rsquo;s Get Set campaign (www.gov.ie/letsgetset ), which encourages us all to set a healthy routine</p><p>The Healthy Ireland Strategic Action Plan, which is a Government of Ireland initiative, requires us to empower people to better look after their own health and wellbeing, to help prevent ill-health and to keep themselves well.  Our goal through Healthy Ireland is to inspire and support behavioural change and to engage citizens in bringing this change about.</p><p>Operation Transformation encourages the Irish public to get active and get healthy. Over the course of the 8-week show it gives the nation the tools they need to get moving, eat healthily and improve overall wellbeing.</p><p>Healthy Ireland sponsored Operation Transformation in 2021 as part of the Government &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo; resilience campaign and as part of its obligations under Step 4 of the OPAP. Whilst the sponsorship does not confer editorial control it does allow Healthy Ireland work with the producers and recommend or weave in themes and messages on health topics, which are not confined to healthy eating and physical activity. </p><p>The Department of Health commissioned an independent quantitative market research exercise to provide some metrics, based on people&rsquo;s responses in the immediate aftermath of the series.  This confirmed, among other findings, that almost three quarters of respondents who watched the show said that they had made one or more positive lifestyle changes as a result of watching the show, including one third who replied that they were eating healthier food.  Importantly, the vast majority of those said that they were likely to continue with the health behaviour changes that they had made.  Also, with 63% of viewers stating that they have made the changes with their household or family, this demonstrates that the impact is much wider that just the one viewer but rather the entire household.  </p><p>In 2021, an average of 469,000 viewers watched Operation Transformation each week, and sponsorship of this flagship RTE programme creates an enormous opportunity for Healthy Ireland to promote trusted information and resources on how to enjoy good physical and mental health.</p><p>In the current series we have seen the leaders start their journey to adopt healthy habits, under the supervision of a GP, a clinical psychologist, a nutritionist and a personal trainer. Linkages to the HSE&rsquo;s Quit (smoking) Programme, opening the conversation around grief and menopause are all important messages that are being delivered as part of the series. There has also been a big focus on community, with a piece showcasing the &ldquo;Men on the Move&rdquo; programme. </p><p>The &ldquo;Ireland Lights Up&rdquo; initiative has also returned with the launch being included from Croke Park. At present over 700 GAA clubs have signed up and opened their clubs to allow communities to come together and walk in safe environment. This is particularly important on the dark January nights in rural areas, where there often are not any areas that are lit up to allow for safe exercise for the individuals and the community. Sport Ireland&rsquo;s Local Sports Partnerships also arranged nationwide walks across the counties that took place on the 16<sup>th</sup>of January. </p><p>The cost of sponsorship of the show are included in the table below.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Sponsorship Amount &euro; (exclusive of VAT) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>230,000 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 </td>       <td>230,000 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The duration of the contract for 2021 was from 6th January to 24th February and in 2022 from 5th January to 23rd February. </p></reply>

To adapt and improve accessibility, Mental Health Services and many of its funded NGO partners, successfully fast-tracked new digital health options including innovative online, text and phone supports. Telehealth services are now fully established and are provided as part of a blended service delivery, the majority of which are available seven days per week, with some providing 24-hour support. 7-day telehealth services include YourMentalHealth.ie, the information line 1800 111 888, the crisis textline 50808 and NGO partners&rsquo; online supports (details of each can be found on yourmentalhealth.ie).</p><p>The HSE recently partnered with SilverCloud, on the national roll out of digital cognitive behavioural therapy  (links.uk.defend.egress.com/Warning?crId=615f0e0d8018f31fc6b588b9&amp;amp;Domain=health.gov.ie&amp;amp;Base64Url=eNo9ykEKgDAMBdETpQGX3ibi15SmpZhArm83up15GjF9Z87MraijVHDC7EAdN3eMECOFWCiH4pFZ4bRiW59knOSwawmb_NXfFY1uLxS6JQ4%3D) (CBT) to address depression and anxiety in Ireland in an effort to make mental health support more widely available. Referrals can be made from Primary Care Psychology, the National Counselling Service, Jigsaw and GPs across Ireland, enabling individuals, including young people to access essential supports within 24 hours of referral.</p><p>Last year I launched the Talking Therapies Model of Care, which is delivered by trained therapists. Talking Therapy helps people to better understand their feelings and behaviour in order to make positive changes and improve their lives. In Ireland, we currently offer a range of talking therapies to people experiencing mental health difficulties, in primary care, specialist services and through HSE partner organisations.</p><p>Counselling in Primary Care (CIPC) continues to be available to adults with medical cards. In December, I announced a significant reduction of over 19% among children and young people under 18 waiting more than 12 months to be seen by Primary Care Psychology following an allocation of &euro;4 million last August to address such lists through targeted initiatives. Work continues on the development of a sustainable Primary Care Psychology Service.</p><p>For young people specifically, the HSE continues to work with <b>SpunOut.ie</b>to provide engaging online mental health content and signposting. Jigsaw also has developed other offerings to support young people, notably through its Live Chat service.</p><p>Dedicated funding was allocated to respond to the challenges of Covid-19, including &euro;2.2 million in 2020, &euro;15 million in 2021 and a further &euro;10 million as part of the Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead Plan. As part of this &euro;10 million a number of initiatives have been identified and are being progressed by HSE Mental Health Services and NGO partners. These include enhanced signposting and access to existing mental health services, increased channels for signposting, increased provision for service delivery, psychosocial response planning at Community Healthcare Organisation level, and initiatives for children and young people of school age, at third level and in non-education settings.</p><p>An additional once off &euro;10 million was announced on Budget Day to further support the mental health sector.  A significant amount of the funding will be used to improve the experiences of people using HSE mental health inpatient units, day centres, community mental health teams and community residences in every community across the country.  Almost &euro;3 million will be made available to the community and voluntary sector, including &euro;1 million to NGO partner MyMind.  Through this funding, MyMind will continue to deliver free of charge counselling sessions, in over 15 languages, to clients impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Up to 16,500 counselling and psychotherapy sessions will be provided, via video or telephone call to individuals. Since 2020, with funding from the Slaintecare Integration Fund, MyMind has delivered over 21,000 appointments.</p><p>As part of this funding, Mental Health Ireland will manage a grant scheme on behalf of the Department, providing grants of between &euro;10,000-&euro;30,000 for the development and implementation of locally-led actions from community and voluntary agencies promoting mental health and wellbeing in the context of Sharing the Vision and Connecting for Life.</p><p>In addition, the HSE is delivering whole population mental health and well-being services in response to Covid-19 based on the HSE Psychosocial Framework, which is reflective of best international practice. Launched in January 2021, the framework provides a clear plan to build on existing psychosocial supports to the public and healthcare workers, with a co-ordinated, consistent and collaborative approach to mental health services. Supports are provided across five key levels, from mental health promotion to specialist services, during and beyond Covid.</p><p>The Government has invested &euro;7 million in the Keep Well campaign to support initiatives with a range of partners, including &lsquo;Keeping In Contact&rsquo; and the Community Call programme aimed at people who might be experiencing isolation and offering befriending services.</p><p>More generally but significantly, all aspects of mental health services continue to be improved and developed, through implementation of the national mental health policy Sharing the Vision (StV). The policy aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020-2030.</p><p>A negative mental health outcome from the pandemic is not inevitable, if we respond in a cohesive manner. Nevertheless, the Department and HSE continue to plan for any surge in demand as it arises, including through consultation with the community and voluntary sector.</p><p>As the HSE is responsible for delivering mental health services, I am referring this PQ to them for part answer to ensure a comprehensive account of therapy and counselling services being provided during and post-Covid-19.</p></reply>

Current policy advice on vitamin D supplementation is aimed at three population groups; infants, 1-4 year old children and all adults 65 years and over. The new policy recommendation for adults 65 years and over was introduced in November 2020 and outlines the importance of vitamin D for bone and muscle health. It recommends that people aged 65 and older take a 15 micrograms (15μg) vitamin D supplement every day to ensure they get the essential amount of vitamin D they need.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 2 is regarding vitamin D supplementation of the entire population. My Department has requested the Scientific Committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to review the evidence on this and provide me with recommendations. This is the process used by my Department to ensure evidence- based advice. The report will be delivered in 2022.</p>  <p>  Once the Food Safety Authority of Ireland recommendations are received, my Department will develop a public health policy to increase knowledge and encourage increased intake of Vitamin D through supplementation, if appropriate.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 3 deals with the issue of reducing the cost of Vitamin D supplementation by reconsidering the current VAT rate applied. This is a matter for the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 4 requires that specific measures be put in place for frontline workers and is a matter for the HSE and my Department have referred this to HSE for direct reply to the Deputy. With regard to specific measures being put in place for vulnerable groups, especially nursing home residents, my Department has had discussions with the HSE Clinical Lead for Older People regarding implementing the vitamin D policy for adults aged 65 years and older in nursing homes.</p></reply>

In line with Sl&aacute;intecare and Vision 2020, a significant programme of work is underway to transform the NAS from an emergency medical service into a mobile medical service. This is a model which aims to treat patients at the lowest appropriate level of acuity, resulting in a better experience for the patient and more efficient use of resources.</p>  <p>  I can advise that a new five-year NAS strategic plan is currently being finalised by the HSE. This plan, elements of which have been funded in Budget 2022, will facilitate a strategic organisational redesign and continued focus on key priorities including alternative care pathways and progress towards meeting capacity requirements and performance targets. It will be supported by an independently conducted National Demand and Capacity Analysis which has been commissioned by NAS with a view to informing future capacity requirements and workforce planning up to 2027.</p>  <p>  As the additional queries raised are service matters for the National Ambulance Service I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.  </p></reply>

The Report sets out current levels of service, models of service provision and the consultation process undertaken with patients, advocates, ophthalmic staff and representative bodies.</p> <blockquote> 	It also highlights the limitations of the current model of service delivery, including the impact on waiting lists, and sets out the way forward for a significant amount of eye services to be delivered in a primary care setting.<br /><br />The Report estimates that 60% of existing outpatient activity could be moved to primary care thus enabling hospital services to focus on patients who require more specialist diagnostics or treatments. This Report remains current and the HSE has prioritised the following services in 2022:<br /><br />- Establishing and expanding adult and paediatric primary care eye teams in CHOs 6, 7 and 9.<br /><br />- Equipping CHOs 6, 7 an 9 with enhanced management of patients with cataract and other eye conditions to reduce hospital waiting lists. Over time, some of this work may transition to the local community optometrists, similar to the Sligo model of post-cataract care.<br /><br />- Advance efforts to transfer the care of children aged 8+ years to the care of local private optometrists; a project team was established in late 2019 / early 2020 to progress this initiative but it was necessary to pause the project as the HSE concentrated its resources on response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The HSE are committed to bringing the project to conclusion over a 6-to-9-month time frame in 2022. <br /><br />- Creating a new role of Consultant Medical Ophthalmologist, subject to the availability of resources.<br /><br />- Successful recruitment of 1.0 WTE Consultant Medical Ophthalmologist per CHO 6, 7 and 9 to oversee clinical governance in the areas. There is a panel in place to recruit additional Consultant Medical Ophthalmologists to other CHOs and this will be rolled out in line with funding approval.<br /><br />The Department fully supports the development of community services to expand and integrate the provision of eye care in local communities.  </blockquote></reply>

Its establishment is a priority in the current Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The proposal is to formalise a new model for collaborative working within Government and place a Pathfinder unit on a statutory footing, through section 12 of the Public Service Management Act 1997. This section has not been used before.</p>  <p>  Various administrative, budgetary, governance and legal arrangements need to be developed and agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure a robust and workable model for the Pathfinder unit. The demands on both Departments during the pandemic have presented challenges to progressing the proposals. Nonetheless, the Department of Health has continued to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to develop an implementation option that fully addresses these issues.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform discussed improved proposals for governance and legal arrangements at their last meeting. Since then, the Department of Health has worked with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on the proposals for governance and legal arrangements. These draft proposals are being considered with participating departments at present. Once agreed, these will be submitted to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Recommendations from the National Youth Mental Health Task Force Report 2017 to build an evidence base to inform the development of youth mental health policy and service delivery, and to develop policy to give effect to youth mental health priorities and objectives, will be taken on by the new unit subject to agreement on the proposals. The report&rsquo;s other recommendations were incorporated into the service plans of lead agencies over the three year lifespan of the report, which concluded in December 2020.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the Pathfinder project is a priority for me and I will continue to keep this matter under close review in the context of progressing Sharing the Vision.</p></reply>

The current difficulties are made more acute by the recent sharp rise in input costs for the sector.</p><p>The pig sector has shown exceptional growth over the last decade. It is the third largest agri-food sector, accounting for 6.3% of the output value of the agri-food sector and generated exports of &euro;893 million in 2020; with 2021 figures to end of October at &euro;765 million. </p><p>The average price paid for pigs in Ireland has fallen in recent months, in line with trends across the EU. The 2021 average price was 8.71% lower than that of 2020. </p><p>The first week of 2022 (w/e 9<sup>th</sup>January) saw the average grade E pig price come in at 142.72 &euro;/100kg,  8.14% lower than the same week last year. However, this is still well above the EU average price of 132.15&euro;/100kg.</p><p>My Department continues to support the Irish pigmeat sector and facilitate its development by prioritising market access, both through maintaining existing markets and pursuing access to new ones.</p><p>My colleague, Minister of State Martin Heydon chairs the Pig Roundtable, which was established in early 2021, and the next meeting of which will take place next week. The Pig Roundtable focuses on key strategic developments for the sector in line with priority actions set out in the Programme for Government and Food Vision 2030. </p><p>In relation to any processing constraints in the sector, my officials have liaised closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to labour shortages in the meat processing sector. As a result, additional employment permits for workers from outside the EU and EEA were approved by that Department in October last year, including  a new allocation of permits for 1,500 meat processing operatives and 500 meat de-boners. </p><p>My officials continue to monitor the market situation closely and I have met with stakeholders to discuss concerns. Our pig farmers have always been remarkably resilient but I am acutely aware of the challenges they are facing at present.</p><p>At this week's Agriculture Council,  I clearly expressed my concerns in relation to the difficulties facing the Irish pigmeat sector, both in relation to the ongoing impact of increases in fuel, fertiliser, feed and energy prices over recent times which are putting farmer margins under significant pressure; and the sustained nature of the difficulties being experienced on the pigmeat market. I sought the rapid deployment of appropriate solutions on both issues. </p></reply>

Available through participating banks and credit unions, the BILS provides loans to Brexit-impacted Irish businesses for working capital, investment and re-financing, with terms of up to six years. </p><p>Loans range from &euro;25,000 to a maximum of &euro;1.5m, are available for terms of between one and six years, with up to &euro;500,000 available as unsecured finance.  My Department's funding ( &euro;5.506m in 2021) ensures that up to 40% of the Scheme will be available to the agri-food sector.</p><p>My Department also co-funds the &euro;800million Future Growth Loan Scheme (FGLS) with the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment. It supports strategic long-term capital investment by SMEs, farmers and fishermen.  The allocation of &euro;7.315 million in my Department&rsquo;s 2021 Supplementary Estimate facilitated the Scheme for 2022.</p><p>In response to any current difficulties caused by the pandemic in accessing credit, the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme also provides an important source of working capital and investment finance.</p><p>In 2022, &euro;40m has been allocated for Brexit related purposes for the fisheries sector (&euro;32m), the horticultural sector (&euro;1m), and &euro;7 million has been provided to fund an Enterprise Ireland capital investment scheme for meat and dairy processing.  </p><p>The latter scheme will support investments aimed at product and market diversification.  It is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.. </p><p>It is expected that the &euro;40m of funding as outlined, will come from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, which provides financial support to the most affected Member States to counter the adverse economic, social, territorial and, where appropriate, environmental consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  </p><p>Expenditure under the Reserve must demonstrate a direct link to the negative impact of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, and failure to do so will see the European Commission deem expenditure ineligible. It is anticipated that the Department will receive further funding from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve during 2022.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.</p><p><b>Covid-19 supports</b></p><p>With regards to Covid-19 related assistance, Ireland was allocated &euro;189m in European Recovery Instrument (EURI) funding for the transitional period.  This EU funding, was programmed through the Rural Development Programme in 2021 and 2022, with commitments and expenditure possible up to the end of 2025.  EURI funding will focus on addressing the biodiversity, climate and environment challenges in the context of economic recovery from COVID-19, through green and digital investments on farm and in rural communities, including through the LEADER Programme.  In doing so, it will maintain the level of environmental ambition in the current RDP and meet the requirements under the EURI to focus on a resilient, sustainable, and digital economic recovery.  In 2022, the EURI allocation is &euro;71.8m.</p><p>In addition to the EURI funding, &euro;2m of a Covid exchequer allocation was provided in the 2022 Budget for Horse Racing Ireland to assist with the cost of operating racing under Covid-19 restrictions.</p></reply>

Succession and the early transfer of family farms is supported by Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax and Stamp Duty exemptions. In addition, the Succession Farm Partnership Scheme provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to further assist the transfer of land within a partnership structure to encourage earlier transfer of family farms.  Investment and access to land are supported by 100% Stamp Duty Relief for Young Trained Farmers, 100% Stock Relief for Young Trained Farmers and Relief for Long-Term Leasing  </p>  <p>  On access to finance, the Future Growth Loan Scheme was developed with assisting young farmers among its objectives and has been in great demand, with 1,294 loans to the value of &euro;155.5 million sanctioned to farmers. In addition, Teagasc's education activities continue to focus on equipping young farmers with the necessary knowledge to build successful careers. </p>  <p>  The Land Mobility Service is a Macra na Feirme initiative supported by numerous stakeholders including my Department. The service provides options for landowners and opportunities for young farmers through advice on and facilitation of collaborative farming arrangements. It has been supported by my Department since 2014 and has seen well over 500 arrangements covering approximately 19,000 hectares being facilitated. My Department is engaged with the Land Mobility Service on future support, and I announced a 100% increase in the funding for 2022 to &euro;100,000. </p>  <p>  The CAP Strategic Plan submitted to the EU Commission at the end of December 2021 contains proposed support measures for young farmers.  Under Pillar I of the next CAP Ireland has proposed support for young farmers as a priority category under the National Reserve to provide for an allocation of payment entitlements at the national average value on eligible land for which the young farmer holds no entitlements, or topping up low value entitlements held by the young farmer to the national average.  Ireland has also proposed utilising the option to implement the Complementary Income Support for Young Farmers.  This scheme would see an additional payment per hectare made to eligible young farmers, subject to a maximum of 50 hectares, for a period of five years. </p>  <p>  Under Pillar II of the next CAP, it is proposed that a grant rate for young farmers for Capital Investments will be 60% with an indicative investment ceiling limit to be applied of &euro;90,000 per holding and &euro;160,000 per holding for partnership applications. This level of grant rate is proposed in order to support young farmers and specifically to enable them to take on any necessary on farm infrastructural improvement work. This 60% grant rate compares favourably to the general 40% rate and is designed to be a significant support for qualified young farmers. </p>  <p>  The proposed supports for young farmers under the next CAP will be subject to Ireland receiving EU Commission approval for the CAP Strategic Plan.</p></reply>
