The Deputy will be aware that the Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years, to facilitate the expansion of EVs in the Irish car fleet. A draft National Charging Infrastructure Strategy has been published for public consultation which sets out a pathway for the provision of charging infrastructure to stay ahead of demand.</p>  <p>  The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. </p>  <p>  Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include multi-unit developments. The final legal checks are being completed and this scheme will be launched shortly.</p>  <p>  The Infrastructure Strategy proposes that for those who cannot charge at home, provision of residential charging solutions that give the same benefits and mirror the home charging option should be the first objective.</p>  <p>  There is an onus on national and local government to facilitate the provision of these charging solutions for citizens who do not have access to a home charge point.</p>  <p>  The Strategy proposes a new Residential charging scheme that will replace the existing Public Points scheme. It is envisaged that this new scheme will provide significant co-funding of 75% to Local Authorities to support the design of local area charging networks, as well as the delivery and installation of these networks which are intended to comprise both on-street charging in areas where residents do not have access to home charging solutions, and destination charge points.</p></reply>

The Programme is developed taking account of Government policy as set out in the Programme for Government, the National Development Plan and the Climate Action Plan and is progressed based on available funding.</p><p>In the new NDP launched in October 2021, approximately &euro;5.1 billion is earmarked for new national road projects to 2030. This funding will facilitate improved regional accessibility and will also support compact growth, both of which are key <i>national strategic outcomes</i>in the National Planning Framework. The funding will provide for the development of a number of national road projects including the development of a limited number of new projects as well as the completion of projects which are already at construction stage and those close to it.</p><p>The existing N20 is a national primary road connecting the cities of Cork and Limerick. Buttevant, Croom, Charleville, Mallow and Blarney are towns along the route. The road is included in the list of projects to be progressed in the NDP. TII have allocated &euro;5 million to Limerick City and County Council to progress the scheme this year.</p><p>The road corridor options to augment and/or replace the existing N20 Cork-Limerick road have been examined. These options were a new dual-carriageway or motorway, or the upgrading of various sections of the existing N20. These road options largely follow the existing route corridor. A number of rail scenarios have also been considered as potential solutions in improving Cork-Limerick connectivity.</p><p>Following a public consultation, the Route Options Selection stage has been completed and the <i>Preferred Solution</i>was announced on the 30th of March. This would consist of building a dual-carriageway or motorway along the existing N20 corridor between Cork and Limerick. The Preferred Solution also includes 80km of new active travel infrastructure for walking and cycling, as well as improvements to public transport which would include offering an improved rail service between Cork and Limerick on the existing network.</p><p>Following this, work on design and environmental evaluation is now being undertaken by the project team, in addition to the scheme Business Case which is required under the Public Spending Code. </p><p>With regard to Compulsory Purchase Orders, as Minister I am currently unable to provide assurances to residents along  the chosen route that their homes will not be the subject of CPOs.  The route design has yet to be developed within the corridor and it is necessary to follow the statutory processes to be in a position to deliver the final project. The timing for the following steps would depend on the outcome of the planning process, and this would include the matter of CPOs.</p></reply>

It faces two imminent and important milestones in the coming months - Government approval of the Preliminary Business Case in line with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and, following this, the submission of a Railway Order application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The MetroLink project has been subject to extensive non-statutory public consultation and comprises the 19km route from north of Swords to the southern edge of the city centre, as outlined in the Preferred Route published by Transport Infrastructure Ireland.</p><p>Secondly we have the statutory review of the <i>Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area</i>. The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 (as amended) stipulates that the <i>Strategy</i>must be reviewed every six years and this review provides an opportunity to re-examine and re-consider proposals for inclusion in the revised <i>Strategy</i>. </p><p>The National Transport Authority (NTA), as part of its review, considered the appropriate transport provision to serve the transport demand throughout the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) including the south and south west corridors into Dublin, and whether additional metro routes, above and beyond MetroLink, should be included in any revised <i>Strategy</i>.</p><p>The NTA published the draft <i>Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy 2022 - 2042 </i>in November 2021, along with a suite of background reports (including the <i>Metro to Knocklyon Feasibility Study</i>), to facilitate an informed public consultation process which concluded on 10 January this year.</p><p>The NTA appraised a number of options for underground Metro in several locations in the GDA and found that forecast demand for travel during the period covered by the <i>Strategy </i>currently only justifies an underground metro system in the Swords-Dublin Airport-City Centre/Charlemont corridor. The Strategy also confirms that the Charlemont stop is the best location for the MetroLink terminus and will facilitate future extensions of the metro service to the south should the forecast demands increase over time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-26a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600059#WRA02400"><p>Electric scooters are a type of powered personal transporter (PPT). PPTs are classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, the use of which requires a valid licence, tax and appropriate insurance in accordance with Section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As PPTs do not fall under any existing vehicle category, it is not currently possible to tax and insure them and there is no separate licence category for them. Therefore, it is illegal to use them on public roads and in public places. However, their use is permitted on private land, with the permission of the landowner. </p>  <p>  It is intended to legislate for the use of e-scooters, in accordance with the Programme for Government, as soon as possible, so that they may be used on our roads within a clear legal framework. Provision to regulate for PPT use has been made in the Road Traffic and Roads Bill, which has completed second stage in the D&aacute;il and is due to go to committee stage shortly.</p>  <p>  In order to allow for the rapid pace of technological change in this area, specific controls on the use of e-scooters will be set out in regulations, following the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. The use of e-scooters on public roads will become legal only once these regulations are in place. </p></reply>

To this end, all new transport infrastructure and services are accessible from the start and older facilities are gradually being retrofitted.  </p>  <p>  I welcome the significant progress that has been made by the NTA and public transport operators on delivering NDIS Action 100. A few examples of this progress include: the Lift Renewal and Replacement Programme in Irish Rail as well as the planned lift upgrades for the Luas network; audio and visual &lsquo;next stop&rsquo; announcements on all Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead buses; greater accessibility requirements for operator websites and apps; and an improving standard of disability awareness training for staff. Progress and further engagement is monitored and facilitated through the regular NDIS Steering Group meetings which my Department attends.</p>  <p>  Additional action, particularly around upgrading older facilities, is still required. To this end, my Department is funding a multi-annual Accessibility Retrofit Programme which will deliver more accessible bus stops in rural and regional areas, upgrade bus bays and train stations, improve access for wheelchair users, and provide grant support to increase the number of wheelchair accessible taxis. Over &euro;15m has been allocated to advance these measures this year. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, in line with the NDIS action, a number of initiatives are also underway to promote independent travel for Persons with Disabilities. Such measures include Disability Awareness Training for public transport frontline staff, the rollout of the Just A Minute (JAM) Card to assist anyone with a communications difficulty, and ensuring that information is provided in accessible formats. The NTA also plans to roll out the Travel Assist Scheme to Cork later this year. This Scheme has been successfully operating for 13 years in the Greater Dublin Area and has proven to give people with disabilities the confidence to use public transport.</p>  <p>  While my Department and its Agencies has responsibility for open public transport services only, we will also continue to work with other Departments and Agencies which have responsibility for dedicated and specialist disability transport services. Together we are ensuring a more accessible network across the country.</p></reply>

This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well assists in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home. This means that the majority of EV users will never need to access the public network except for longer journeys.</p>  <p>  A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p>  <p>  There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as non-residential neighbourhood charging, destination charging, and motorway charging. </p>  <p>  There are over 50 public charging points in Co. Mayo presently, not including private home charging points.</p>  <p>  A significant increase in funding for public charging points will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.</p>  <p>  The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and has announced through the draft Infrastructure Strategy a number of additional actions to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the de-carbonisation effort.</p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

However, when serving on ships of another flag, they are not subject to Irish law. </p>  <p>  Irish employment rights legislation applies to workers &ndash; national and non-national - on board Irish registered ships.  In relation to ships that are not Irish registered, the flag state (i.e. the state where the ship is registered) has the exclusive right to exercise legislative and enforcement jurisdiction over ships on the high seas.</p>  <p>  In terms of inspections, the Marine Survey Office (MSO) is the competent authority for port state control inspections, which  ensures compliance with safety requirements after the owner/operator and the flag state.</p>  <p>  The MSO has been liaising closely with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) of the United Kingdom in relation to the one affected vessel which may operate to Ireland, the M/V Norbay.  The MSO attended the MCA's inspection of the ship in an observer role last week. Yesterday, 25 April, the MSO inspected the M/V Norbay in Dublin Port in accordance with EU Directive 2009/16.  The vessel has now been cleared to enter into service. </p>  <p>  Maritime transport is a global and mobile industry and requires a global response to ensure effective regulation.  </p>  <p>  The main instrument dealing with seafarer living and working conditions is the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Maritime Labour Convention, 2006  which Ireland ratified in 2014.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has overall responsibility for ILO issues, supported by the Department of Transport for shipping matters.  It is important in the first instance that flag states take responsibility for their fleet and that the Maritime Labour Convention is appropriately applied and enforced.  Only then can seafarers have confidence in maintaining a sustainable career.  In the case of P&amp;O, I understand the relevant flag states are Cyprus, Bahamas, Bermuda and the Netherlands.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work at international level through the International Maritime Organisation, the International Labour Organisation and the EU to strengthen the protection of seafarers.</p></reply>

This has caused a spike in the price of crude and in the price of refined products on the retail market.</p>  <p>  In response to the pressures caused by increased fuel costs, </p>  <p>  Recognising that escalating fuel costs were a problem in particular for the licensed haulage sector, on 15 March 2022, the Government approved an emergency scheme to provide support of &euro;100 per week for eight weeks for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. </p>  <p>  In deciding on a targeted scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for some own account operators also, in addition fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead costs for licensed hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Diesel Rebate Scheme, this is a matter for my colleague Minister Donohoe. It should be noted however that support under the Scheme was increased in Budget 2020. In light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry, the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.32 (VAT inclusive) was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre and in recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, this increase in the DRS has been maintained since.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme and the Diesel Rebate Scheme, on 09 March the Government announced a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction on auto diesel, to the benefit of all businesses and citizens facing increased fuel costs. On 11 April, it was agreed that these reductions will remain in place until Budget Day.</p>  <p>  In general, however, it should be recalled that the causes of these increases are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, we must accept that it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases. In addition, we cannot compromise the progress we have made on implementing climate policies which are critical to ensuring we reduce emissions and address climate change impacts.</p>  <p>  In light of these last two factors, it is important that haulage and other businesses now engage with their customers on the need for the prices for their products and services to reflect the increased costs.</p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme and the continuing Diesel Rebate Scheme it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases.</p></reply>

At that time there was no safety survey or certification scheme for such vessels and there were no regulations for the structure, stability or machinery. At that time when the &ldquo;MFV Mary Kate&rdquo; fishing vessel was registered on the Irish flag it just required a tonnage survey carried out by the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of my Department.</p>  <p>  New safety regulations, SI (2007) 640, were introduced by my predecessor to address the safety of fishing vessels in this length category. These regulations had a phase in timeline and required compliance for existing fishing vessels over a number of years from 2007 to 2010 depending on the keel laying date of the vessel. For the &ldquo;MFV Mary Kate&rdquo; this meant that compliance was required in 2009. In some cases, the MSO would not be able to issue a safety certificate to an existing fishing vessel which came within the scope of the new regulations until it had been brought into compliance and this was the case for the &ldquo;MFV Mary Kate&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  It appears that the issue in this case relates to the differing safety standards applicable to fishing vessels in the 15m to 24m length category in EU member states. I wish to advise that my Department did make both the European Commission and all other Member States aware of potential safety concerns with other similar fishing vessels. </p>  <p>  I further wish to advise that any issues relating to fisheries aspects of this case fall under the purview of my colleague the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></reply>

A national charging infrastructure strategy was published for consultation at the end of this March which sets out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2025.</p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p>  <p>  There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles -  Seventeen      high-power    chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades. </p>  <p>  The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and has announced through the strategy a number of additional actions to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the de-carbonisation effort.</p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p>  <p>  While the public consultation regarding the charging infrastructure strategy is ongoing, my Department continues to engage directly with stakeholders to ensure that a sufficient number of chargers, as well as a sufficient spread of charger types, will be in place to meet demand as we move towards our 2030 target of circa 1 million EVs on the road. </p></reply>

Local Link has a key role to play in supporting those refugees located in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  From the beginning of the crisis, Local Link services have been providing newly arriving Ukrainians with free travel to their end destination. And further to my announcement last week regarding the provision of emergency public transport services to those refugees housed in rural or isolated locations, I envisage Local Link having a significant role to play here too. </p>  <p>  Work will be undertaken to accelerate improvements across the Local Link network, including additional stops, route modifications, and more services with the aim to increase connectivity between communities. Areas such as the Ring of Kerry will avail of such improvements, in practice catering for both existing demands as well as responding to the increased pressures on services where the local population has grown in response to the humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  Additional bus services will also be deployed to cater for those refugees housed away from the existing public transport network. For instance, the NTA is looking at options to provide transport from the Earl of Desmond - where many refugees have been accommodated - to Tralee town. Such measures will provide better access to a range of amenities, employment opportunities and to onward public transport connections to larger centres.</p>  <p>  I expect TFI Local Link offices to be fundamental in the management and administration of the newly introduced Community Transport Fund. This Fund will support occasional social travel requests to enable our Ukrainian guests to join in the many activities that are available in our towns, in particular, activities focused on youth, integration, culture, and education.</p>  <p>  Collectively, these endeavours aim to provide a means of greater integration between rural and Ukrainian communities. I was pleased to be able to increase the Rural Transport Budget this year to accommodate these worthy amendments.</p></reply>

I established a daily crisis management meeting between the Department and daa to monitor the situation.</p>  <p>  The company has undertaken significant work to address and mitigate the security queue times at Dublin Airport. It has put in place a number of measures including stepping up recruitment efforts; redeployment of staff where possible; establishing a senior management taskforce; opening security lanes on a 24/7 basis and enhancing communications with passengers. These measures are having a positive impact on passenger queue times at the airport. This positive impact was seen over the Easter weekend, even as passenger numbers reached around 200,000 departing passengers between Good Friday and Easter Monday. The vast majority of passengers went through security in under 40 minutes, and I am informed by daa that no passenger missed their flight as a result of security delays.</p>  <p>  On 19 April daa published revised advice for passengers following consistently improved queuing times over the last few weeks, including over Easter weekend. Passengers are now advised to arrive at the airport up to 2.5 hours before the departure of short-haul flights to Europe and the UK. The recommendation for long-haul passengers remains up to 3.5 hours.</p>  <p>  Dublin Airport is planning for a significant increase in passenger volumes over the coming months.   It does note that this increase will present a considerable challenge. Management is reviewing the experience of the last number of weeks to further develop and refine measures to cater for the increased passenger numbers. I will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days and weeks and continue to engage with daa to ensure the positive impacts seen recently are maintained for passengers using Dublin Airport. </p></reply>

The estimated cost of the backlog is in excess of &euro;5 billion. </p>  <p>  Because of the pressures on the regional and local road network, approximately 90% of available Exchequer grant assistance to local authorities for regional and local roads is being directed to maintenance and renewal works rather than for new roads or for road realignments.</p>  <p>  While funding is not at a level that would allow the backlog of roadworks across the country to be addressed, there has been significant increases in Exchequer grants for regional and local roads particularly in the recent years. The 2022 allocation for regional and local roads is &euro;597 million approximately - &euro;46m Current and &euro;551m Capital. This represents an increase of about 46% compared to 2017. </p>  <p>  I announced the 2022 grant allocations on the 15th of February and all road grant funding available for regional and local roads has now been allocated and a further allocation is not anticipated at this point. Given the uncertainty that exists in the construction sector at present due to high inflation in material costs and disruption to supply chains,  it is expected that the main focus for local authorities will be on getting existing approved work programmes completed. </p></reply>

This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 55,000 now.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. In particular, the group examined the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies. The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is available online. In line with the Group&rsquo;s recommendations to support the transition to EVs: </p>  <p>  - The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland has been retained until at least end-2022. Work is ongoing to identify additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles. Overall, cost-effective, targeted policy supports will continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and   </p>  <p>  - Work is underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  A cross-departmental Implementation Committee has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the EVPP report and is due to report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year. </p>  <p>  Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is kept under continuous review to endeavor to make low emission vehicles affordable.</p>  <p>  The Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Strategy, published at the end of March, concurrently sets out a pathway for the provision of charging infrastructure to stay ahead of demand for EVs as we move towards our 2030 targets.</p></reply>

This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well assists in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home. This means that the majority of EV users will never need to access the public network except for longer journeys.</p>  <p>  A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p>  <p>  There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as non-residential neighbourhood charging, destination charging, and motorway charging. </p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles -  Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project including the rollout of charge points in the Greater Dublin Area can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades. </p>  <p>  The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and has announced through the draft Infrastructure Strategy a number of additional actions to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the de-carbonisation effort. In addition, my Department continues to liaise closely with the Dublin Local Authorities on the delivery of the DLA's EV charging strategy.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

This rises to &euro;225 if it is not paid within 28 days.  This is the highest fixed charged penalty for driving and parking offences.</p><p>Penalty points are applied for driving offences and the only exception is for dangerous parking, which is included as a penalty point offence because it affects moving traffic. Accordingly, I do not consider it appropriate that this offence be included in the penalty point system.</p><p>While I cannot condone the selfish and irresponsible practice of parking unlawfully in disabled bays, I believe that the current level of penalty is proportionate to the offence and I have no plans to increase it at this time.</p></reply>

The overall transport system currently supports and facilitates travel to and from ferry ports by sustainable transport in several ways.   In terms of planning a journey, the National Transport Authority&rsquo;s (NTA) Journey Planner app includes ferry details for ferries within Ireland.  In terms of public transport networks, the location of ferry ports is factored into the planning of the transport networks.  In particular, during the development of recent bus network redesigns in various cities, the need to provide an appropriate level of bus connectivity to ports has been factored into the redesign process, and appropriate service provision included.</p>  <p>  Further work is needed in some areas to provide a more integrated transport experience between public transport services and ferry services, and this will be examined, particularly when new public transport services are being introduced, as will be the case under BusConnects and Connecting Ireland, or where existing services are being amended.   </p>  <p>  Substantial funding for active travel infrastructure has been provided by the Government, equating to &euro;360 million per year, and local authorities can avail of that funding stream, which is largely managed by the NTA, to enhance and develop active travel links to the relevant port.</p>  <p>  Additionally, port companies themselves have been planning and developing improved cycle connections within their own estate area, to link with the external infrastructure provided by the local authorities.  Dublin Port Company in particular have advanced plans to enhance cycle accessibility with the Dublin Port lands, and plan to provide significant cycling routes within the Port.</p>  <p>  With regard to rail access, my department, in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure (Northern Ireland), is undertaking a Strategic Rail Review which will inform the development of the railway sector on the Island of Ireland over the period to 2040. The Review will consider, amongst other matters, connectivity to our air and seaports.  This will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and will provide a framework to develop a much-improved rail network in the years ahead. A final Report is due by the end of this year.</p></reply>

This has caused a spike in the price of crude and in the price of refined products on the retail market.</p>  <p>  On 15 March 2022, Minister Ryan and I proposed to Government an emergency support measure &ndash; the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme. The Scheme will provide support of &euro;100 per week for eight weeks for each eligible heavy goods vehicle (HGV) authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022.  I can confirm that the scheme is available only to operators holding a road haulage operator licence.</p>  <p>  In deciding on a targeted scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for some own account operators also, in addition fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead costs for licensed hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Emergency Scheme however, the Government has provided for an excise duty reduction on mineral oil taxes with effect from 10 March. This saw a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction on auto diesel,  proposed to last until 31 August 2022. On 11 April the Government extended the period of the reduced excise rates out to Budget Day. This measure is a benefit to all citizens and business to mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases.</p>  <p>  In general, however, it should be noted that the causes of these fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. Unfortunately, we must accept that it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases. </p>  <p>  In addition, we must continue the progress we have made to date on the implementation of climate policies which are critical to ensuring we reduce emissions and mitigate climate change. </p>  <p>  In light of these last two factors, it is important that haulage and other businesses now engage with their customers on the need for the prices for their products and services to reflect the increasing costs.</p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measures, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. </p></reply>

I have established a daily crisis management meeting between the Department and daa to monitor the situation.</p>  <p>  The company has undertaken significant work to address and mitigate the security queue times at Dublin Airport. It has put in place a number of measures including stepping up recruitment efforts; redeployment of staff where possible; establishing a senior management taskforce; opening security lanes on a 24/7 basis and enhancing communications with passengers. These measures are having a positive impact on passenger queue times at the airport. This positive impact was seen over the Easter weekend, even as passenger numbers reached around 200,000 departing passengers between Good Friday and Easter Monday. The vast majority of passengers went through security in under 40 minutes, and no passenger missed their flight as a result of security delays.</p>  <p>  On 19 April daa published revised advice for passengers following consistently improved queuing times over the last few weeks, including over Easter weekend. Passengers are now advised to arrive at the airport up to 2.5 hours before the departure of short-haul flights to Europe and the UK. The recommendation for long-haul passengers remains up to 3.5 hours.</p>  <p>  While recruitment of new staff required is ongoing, over 100 new security staff were employed recently and this should assist in the alleviation of the excessive queue times over the coming period.  These security staff are being deployed following the necessary training.</p>  <p>  Dublin Airport is planning for a significant increase in passenger volumes over the coming months.  It does note that this increase will present a considerable challenge. Management is reviewing the experience of the last number of weeks to further develop and refine measures to cater for the increased passenger numbers. I will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days and weeks and continue to engage with daa to ensure the positive impacts seen recently are maintained for passengers using Dublin Airport.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. The transport sector, which accounts for about 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall carbon emissions, must play a central role in the national decarbonisation effort. The national car and van (LGV) fleet accounts for almost 60% of all land transport emissions, and so a transition to low emissions vehicles, including EVs, is a necessary step-change to effect a substantial reduction in transport emissions.  </p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the 2019 Climate Action Plan, and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 936,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.</p><p>There are 11 commercial and 8 non-commercial agencies under the remit of my Department.  I have forwarded the Deputies question to each agency for direct response.  Please contact my Office if no reply is received within 10 working days. </p><p>The Climate Action Plan and the Programme for Government commits to developing and implementing a sustainable public procurement policy, to ensure that what are we buying and building is consistent with our climate ambition. When vehicles fall to be replaced, my department will replace them with electrically powered alternatives, where the cost and suitability of the vehicles for the purpose required allows.</p><p>The Office of Government Procurement has drawn up fixed price procurement frameworks for the supply of long and medium range battery electric passenger cars and vans to public sector bodies. Full details on how to use the framework as well as pricing and supplier contact details can be found on the <i>www.ogp.gov.ie</i>website.  These Frameworks will greatly assist Government departments and bodies to purchase electric cars and vans.As battery and recharging technologies develop and a greater range of vehicles become commercially available I expect an increasing number of public bodies to transition to EVs. </p><p>The use of EVs within public sector vehicle fleets and the installation of associated EV infrastructure is an important exemplar and market driver, providing the necessary public leadership and raising consumer awareness of EVs.</p><p>There are also several initiatives and programmes underway across the public sector that encourage the uptake of electric vehicles.</p><p>- The Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy encourages public sector fleets to test new technologies and facilitate/accelerate their market uptake.</p><p>- Green Public Procurement can act as a driver for innovation and competitiveness in the industrial sector, encouraging the development of new technologies.</p><p>- The recast Clean Vehicles Directive set minimum Member State procurement targets, with the main objective of increasing the uptake of clean (low- and zero-emission) vehicles.</p><p>- The Local Authority Climate Action Charter is a key action in the Climate Action Plan and will ensure every local authority embeds decarbonisation, sustainable development and climate resilience into every aspect of the work they do.</p></reply>

This scheme will be launched shortly.</p>  <p>  The Infrastructure Strategy proposes that for those who cannot charge at home, provision of residential charging solutions that give the same benefits and mirror the home charging option should be the first objective.</p>  <p>  There is an onus on national and local government to facilitate the provision of these charging solutions for citizens who do not have access to a home charge point.</p>  <p>  The Strategy proposes a new Residential charging scheme that will replace the existing Public Points scheme. It is envisaged that this new scheme will provide significant co-funding of 75% to Local Authorities to support the design of local area charging networks, as well as the delivery and installation of these networks which are intended to comprise both on-street charging in areas where residents do not have access to home charging solutions, and destination charge points. </p>  <p>  To coordinate the provision of EV supports and grants and the delivery of charging infrastructure, the Government will establish an office of Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI) within the Department of Transport. ZEVI will coordinate and support the development and roll-out of publicly accessible charging infrastructure. ZEVI will therefore provide co-funding to support Local Authorities in developing local area network plans for EV infrastructure.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is also engaged with public transport operators regarding the issue of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  As such, decisions regarding a dedicated transport police unit and the allocation of Garda resources are matters for the Minister of Justice and the Garda Commissioner. I am given to understand that the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are that effective local community policing can meet the policing needs of the public transport network and that the Garda authorities do not propose to establish a specialist or dedicated transport policing unit at this time.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the Department has been engaging regularly with the NTA and the three CI&Eacute; companies, on the issue of anti-social behaviour and a significant number of actions have been taken. These include; </p>  <p>  - Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have significantly increased their security resources with up to 20 security teams operating daily on-board and in stations (spend on security has increased from &euro;3.7 million to &euro;5.2 million pa since 2016).</p>  <p>  - Since May 2021, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have joined forces to tackle anti-social behaviour in the Greater Dublin Area and on the DART, Northern Line and Heuston to Portlaoise services.</p>  <p>  - Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann liaises on a minimum quarterly basis with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in major districts to address trends and issues on an area basis. </p>  <p>  - An Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann/AGS inter-agency operation was established targeting incidents of graffiti and criminal damage to train carriages; as part of this operation Garda&iacute; conducted patrols of rail lines in an effort to target groups involved in this activity.</p>  <p>  - CCTV is available on most trains and has successfully been used on numerous occasions in securing prosecutions. They are also in place in stations.</p>  <p>  - A DART text alert line has been established for discrete reporting of Anti-Social incidents.</p>  <p>  - There has been an increase in the number of Garda response hubs (to 8) on InterCity routes to support both customers and staff.</p>  <p>  - Appointment of Senior Security Advisor in addition to Security Enforcement &amp;amp; Compliance Manager and Crime Prevention Officer, all of whom are former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with extensive knowledge in the area of crime and crime prevention.</p>  <p>  - Increased number of Prohibition Notices issued to persistent offenders across rail network.</p>  <p>  - Reportable ASB incidents have reduced from 654 in 2020 to 549 in 2021.</p>  <p>  - An Garda Siochana is to co-ordinate a number of Joint Awareness Days (Operation Twin Track) on the Railway and LUAS during 2022. Joint Garda &amp;amp; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann high visibility public safety operations took place across the network over the Easter period with a number of fines issued.</p>  <p>  Transdev Dublin Light Rail, who operate the Luas network on behalf of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, employ 50 security staff. These staff are involved in maintaining safety and security on the Luas, along with enforcing the Luas bye-laws. They liaise with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regularly as part of their work.</p>  <p>  In relation to security on our public bus services, the entire Dublin Bus fleet is fully fitted with CCTV cameras, with up to 11 internal cameras and three external cameras fitted on the more modern vehicles in the fleet. Each vehicle is equipped with a radio, which facilitates immediate contact to the Central Control Centre.</p>  <p>  Any instances of disruption or concerns around security are immediately reported and services are suspended as necessary. The company also has mobile inspectors in the city centre, who are available to attend incidents as required, and all Dublin Bus employees are fully trained on the comprehensive procedures for dealing with specific challenging situations including anti-social behaviour. </p>  <p>  Dublin Bus has also re-introduced their Schools Education Programme (previously suspended due to Covid-19) which involves educating young people about the importance of the bus in their lives and in their local community. The work of their School and Community Co-ordinators has also proven highly successful in encouraging young people to respect their bus and has assisted greatly in the reduction of incidents of anti-social behaviour.</p>  <p>  Beyond this Dublin Bus has a strong and close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have set up a number of community forums in different areas across the city. These forums are made up of Dublin Bus representatives, the Garda&iacute;, local area representatives, community groups and Trade Union Representatives.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has similarly also invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout its fleet for the protection of passengers and staff. Emergency support for drivers is provided through 24-hour control centres and any incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required. </p>  <p>  All Bus &Eacute;ireann city and town buses are fitted with driver security screens.

The licence will be valid for 12 months and will be for cars only.</p>  <p>  My Department and the National Transport Authority (NTA) will provide emergency public transport services to Ukrainian refugees placed in rural locations. To facilitate this, a series of network improvements, identified through the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan public consultation, will be accelerated to support increased overall demand for public transport services. Improvements will include additional stops, route modifications and more services, to increase connectivity for those based outside bigger towns and cities. This acceleration serves a dual purpose, by catering for existing demand and responding to the increased pressures on services where the local population has grown in response to the humanitarian crisis. </p>  <p>  In addition, to support Ukrainian refugees housed away from existing public transport services, the NTA will provide supplementary transport connections to local centres, to enable better access to a range of amenities and to onward public transport connections. </p>  <p>  Further, free travel is being provided for newly arrived Ukrainian refugees on any Public Service Obligation (PSO) or Local Link public transport service, from port of entry to their end destination. This initiative is being applied across all PSO contracted services, including commercial bus services included in emergency PSO contracts, and those services that are part of the emergency commercial bus operator grant scheme. The situation is being monitored on an ongoing basis. To avail, intending passengers should present the driver/relevant operator employee with the following:</p>  <p>  - Ukrainian passport or other Ukrainian government issued ID and evidence of arrival in Ireland within the previous seven days, such as an airline booking email or boarding card stub, or</p>  <p>  - confirmation of status from a coordinating group or charity involved in the Ukrainian crisis.</p></reply>

The report on this analysis is expected shortly.    </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that individual local authorities will examine, taking into account each Council's  overall priorities and available resources, how projects identified in the risk analysis could be brought forward.  The Department has allocated some grant funding this year to Cavan County Council and Louth County Council for the initial assessment of two possible schemes subject to the receipt of the required project appraisal documentation from the relevant local authorities. </p>  <p>  As regards the national road element of an east-west link, I have referred the question to Transport Infrastructure Ireland for a direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, immediate action is necessary. </p>  <p>  In recent months, my Department has advanced a variety important policy initiatives which will make a significant impact - notably a new Sustainable Mobility Policy, a new Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Strategy, the National Transport Investment Framework, a Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement and a 5 Cities Demand Management Study and associated toolkit. Later this year, we will be publishing a 10 year Haulage Strategy which will inter alia, consider the long term decarbonisation options for this sector</p>  <p>  In terms of investment, through the NTA, we are advancing work on rural public transport (Connecting Ireland), Bus Connects and Active Travel programmes which will seek to promote modal shift to more sustainable transport, along the continued electrification of the public transport fleet and expansion of DART services. My Department is also considering how we can refine current commitments in order to deliver additional emissions reductions in a fair and equitable manner over the next 8 years.</p>  <p>  Reducing car dependency and implementing a radical shift towards sustainable mobility is the ultimate goal. As investments and projects in transport often materialise over the medium-term, my Department is taking action now that will pay dividends in future years.</p></reply>

This has caused a spike in the price of crude and in the price of refined products on the retail market.</p>  <p>  On 15 March 2022, Minister Ryan and I proposed to Government an emergency support measure &ndash; the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme. The Scheme will provide support of &euro;100 per week for eight weeks for each eligible heavy goods vehicle (HGV) authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. I can confirm that the scheme is available only to operators holding a road haulage operator licence.</p>  <p>  In deciding on a targeted scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for some own account operators also, in addition fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead costs for licensed hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Emergency Scheme however, the Government has provided for an excise duty reduction on mineral oil taxes with effect from 10 March. This saw a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction on auto diesel,  proposed to last until 31 August 2022. On 11 April the Government extended the period of the reduced excise rates out to Budget Day. This measure is a benefit to all citizens and business to mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases.</p>  <p>  In general, however, it should be noted that the causes of these fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. Unfortunately, we must accept that it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases. </p>  <p>  In addition, we must continue the progress we have made to date on the implementation of climate policies which are critical to ensuring we reduce emissions and mitigate climate change.</p>  <p>  In light of these last two factors, it is important that haulage and other businesses now engage with their customers on the need for the prices for their products and services to reflect the increasing costs.</p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measures, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. </p></reply>

It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  </p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision.</p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country.

As part of this consultation, members of the public and interested stakeholders were invited to submit their requests for new questions and revisions to existing questions.  To assist the CSO in assessing the submissions, a Census Advisory Group (CAG) was formed. Membership of the CAG was drawn from organisations and groups who regularly use census data. The CAG made recommendations on which new and revised questions should be tested during a Census Pilot survey which was held in September 2018. Following the Pilot, the CAG assisted the CSO in deciding which questions should be recommended to government for inclusion on the census form.</p><p>As part of this process, suggestions to expand the question on the number of rooms in each dwelling to include the number of bedrooms were proposed by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and IBEC.<font color="#FF0000"> </font>This proposal of the extension to the question was accepted by the CAG for testing in the Census Pilot on the basis that data derived from the question could provide increased insights into relative levels of crowding in homes across the country.

We are committed, therefore, to progressing to a living wage over the lifetime of this Government.</p><p>Currently there is no official living wage in Ireland. The Living Wage Technical Group, which comprises members including Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, TASC, NERI and SIPTU calculates a living wage by estimating the cost of a basic basket of goods, services and expenses required to maintain a &ldquo;minimum essential living standard&rdquo;.</p><p>Last year, I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine and make recommendations on the best approach to achieving the Programme for Government commitment to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>The Low Pay Commission recently submitted its report on the living wage. Along with my officials, I will review the Commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations. I will also consider the next steps required in the progression to a living wage, such as the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s report and the accompanying research report, and consultation on the implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations.</p><p>The National Minimum Wage is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. The Low Pay Commission annually assesses the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage. The current national minimum hourly rate of pay, since 1 January 2022, is &euro;10.50.</p><p>Remuneration for staff employed by my Department and its Offices is essentially set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in line with Government policy.  </p><p>Based on the Civil Service 37-hour standard net working week, an hourly wage of &euro;12.30 essentially equates to an annual salary of &euro;23,747.</p><p>There are currently 3 permanent staff of the Department and its Offices on a wage of less than &euro;12.30 per hour based on the latest payroll of April 2022. This is made up of three Services Attendants on the first point of the Services Attendant salary scale. It should be noted that the maximum point on the incremental scales for these staff is above the hourly suggested rate of &euro;12.30,  over time and based on satisfactory performance, each staff member in these grades would proceed to earn more than the living wage through incremental progression. Additionally, those currently identified on basic annual salary of less than &euro;23,747 could be receiving remuneration in excess of this figure through additional payments in respect of specific allowances particular to the grade or atypical working hours.</p><p>In terms of the Agencies of my Department, details are set out in the table below; <table>    <tr>       <th>Agency</th>       <th>Number of persons earning below &euro;12.30 per hour</th>       <th>Role of persons earning below &euro;12.30 per hour</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland *</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>Executive Assistant</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Health and Safety Authority</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>N/a</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA)</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>N/a</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Personal Injuries Assessment Board  (PIAB)</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>N/a</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>IDA Ireland</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>Project Executive Assistants (Level B)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI)</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>N/a</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Intertrade Ireland (ITI)</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CCPC</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>N/a</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Enterprise Ireland has 10 employees who are currently on a rate of pay equivalent to less than &euro;12.30 per hour. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s current sanctioned Level B salary scale (which has relativity with the Civil Service Clerical Officer grade) has a minimum point of &euro;22,049. This is &euro;1,698 lower than the annual equivalent of the standard 37 hour week at &euro;12.30 per hour.

As these consultations are still ongoing, I am not in a position to provide details of the draft proposal.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the EU will continue to engage constructively in discussions in the WTO in order to reach a compromise as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  Global production of COVID-19 vaccines reached 12.6 billion doses by February 2022 and is expected to be between 18 and 19 billion by mid-2022. This means that by mid-2022 we will have sufficient vaccines for everybody in the world, including for booster campaigns.  As vaccine production is no longer an issue, the focus has now shifted to vaccinations and how strengthening health systems and their preparedness is pivotal in the achievement of the 70% vaccination target. </p>  <p>  In 2021, the EU was the largest donor of doses through COVAX and is the largest donor and exporter of vaccines globally. Team Europe has shared more than 400 million vaccine doses and exported over 1.8 billion vaccines to 165 countries and is committed to sharing 700 million doses by mid-2022, with a focus on supporting Africa where vaccination rates are lower than in other parts of the world.  Team Europe is also investing &euro;1 billion to ramp up mRNA production capacity in Africa.</p>  <p>  In addition to dose donation and exports of vaccines, the EU, with its Member States, has committed over &euro;3 billion to COVAX in support of the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government has to date committed to the donation of &euro;13.5 million and five million COVID-19 vaccine doses to the COVAX facility. Over 1.8 million doses have already been delivered to recipient countries including almost 1.5 million doses delivered to African countries including Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, and Burkina Faso, with further deliveries expected to follow shortly.</p></reply>

Last year, I formally requested that the Low Pay Commission examine this issue.</p>  <p>  To inform its considerations, the Low Pay Commission asked the ESRI to conduct background technical research on a universal basic income under the terms of the Low Pay Commission-ESRI research partnership agreement. The study will examine the universal basic income pilots that have taken place in other jurisdictions to identify what was learned and what might be relevant to a pilot in Ireland. It will also seek to identify which policy objectives a universal basic income pilot could address and its associated risks and financial implications. It will conclude with recommendations on how a pilot in Ireland might be designed and run.</p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission intends to provide a report to me on this research and its recommendations during Q2 2022. I expect to be able to publish both the ESRI report and the LPC's report shortly after that.</p></reply>

The trade mission was organised by Enterprise Ireland and had the participation of 60 Irish companies and organisations. Irish business-to-business interests are growing in the Gulf region. Exports by Irish companies to the UAE and Saudi Arabia in 2020, even against the backdrop of a global pandemic, increased by 12% and 6% respectively, signifying the interest by Irish companies and the continued strong opportunities that exist in this rapidly growing market.</p>  <p>  The primary focus of all trade missions and associated meetings is to encourage business-to-business links, to maximise opportunities to help Irish companies to access new markets and to increase the levels of foreign direct investment into Ireland which in turn creates employment opportunities.</p>  <p>  While in Saudi Arabia, I held meetings with the President of the Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation, the Governor and Board of the Saudi Central Bank, the Saudi Minister for Commerce, the Saudi Minister for Investment, and the Saudi Minister for Transport. These meetings were arranged as part of the trade mission to further our trade and investment promotion objectives in Saudi Arabia. I also had discussions on the social and economic transformation which is underway, as part of the Saudi government&rsquo;s Vision 2030. This aims to diversify the Saudi economy, encourage greater personal freedoms, and deepen Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s engagement with regional and international partners which include the European Union.</p>  <p>  To be effective in raising human rights issues with other countries we must do it in an appropriate way and at the right opportunity, so that our concerns are taken seriously and acted upon. Ireland has always been at the forefront internationally in raising human rights issues through bilateral contacts and especially through the European Union and the United Nations.</p>  <p>  I have not had any bilateral engagements with counterparts in Saudi Arabia in 2022.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-26a.315.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600064#WRF05400"><p>At the outset, it should be pointed out that the Regional Aid Map is decided by the European Commission not the Government. In negotiations with the Commission, the Government sought the inclusion of much more of the country including Drogheda Urban.  We will do so again at the mid-term review in 2023 when the data from the census is available. </p><p>In European law, Louth is part of the Mid-East Region (NUTS2) alongside Meath, Kildare and Wicklow not the Border region. Louth is the only county in the Mid-East to have any part of it included as a qualifying area in the Regional Aid Map. This is due to its proximity to the border even though it is not officially in the NUTS2 Border region. </p><p>Regional Aid does not involve any European money or grants and should not be confused with structural funds which Ireland qualified for in the past. Rather it limits the amount of regional state aid that the Irish exchequer can provide to certain geographic areas based on specified criteria. </p><p>In Drogheda, the focus was on including the areas around the town where major industrial development is most likely to occur in the future. So, the following industrial areas in Drogheda Rural do qualify. These are: </p><p>- The new land acquired by IDA Ireland in June 2021. This is located in the townland of Mell and is 7.55 ha. It is located just off Junction 10 on the M1 Dublin to Belfast motorway. For regional aid purposes, this is Drogheda Rural LEA and it is included in the Regional Aid Map.</p><p>- Newtown Science &amp;amp; Tech Park. This is yet to be developed and it is also home to the Drogheda Enterprise Centre, a REDF funded project.</p><p>- Drogheda North Business Park. This is yet to be developed. </p><p>The Regional Aid Map for every Member State must be developed within the criteria laid down in the European Commission&rsquo;s Regional Aid Guidelines, issued in April 2021. Ireland&rsquo;s economy has shown strength and improvement since 2014.  As a consequence, the European Commission proposed to reduce the overall coverage of Ireland&rsquo;s Map, as measured by proportion of total population, to 25.6%. Following intensive negotiations with the Commission, this was increased to 35.9%.  This is a reduction of almost one third from the 51.3% which applied previously.  This adjustment was part of a European wide review and Ireland was not unique in facing a reduction in coverage. With a more limited population coverage, and the strict criteria set by the Commission, it was important that the optimal allocation was achieved.</p><p>To achieve this, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, working with stakeholders, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, developed a multi-dimensional model that provided a depth of analysis within the Commission&rsquo;s set criteria.  This was an objective and impartial approach, though final approval of the Map, for Ireland and for all Member States, rests with the European Commission. The Commission announced its decision on 22 March 2022. </p><p>Due to the more limited population coverage available to be allocated, several Local Electoral Areas (LEAs) identified by the multi-dimensional model could not be included. We sought to include these areas and explored all options with the European Commission, but it was not possible to include them. However, they have been recognised and listed as reserves, including Drogheda Urban, and these areas will be kept under close review with a view to including them as part of a mid-term review of the Map, which will take place in 2023. </p><p>Highly residential LEAs such as Drogheda Urban tend not to be areas where enterprises might develop. While Drogheda Urban LEA is not included in the Map there is scope for positive &lsquo;spill-over&rsquo; effects for the Drogheda Urban LEA, e.g., residents of Drogheda Urban LEA can benefit from employment opportunities in neighbouring areas. </p><p>LEAs not included on the map can still access all other types of State Aid. Only approximately 7.4% of Ireland&rsquo;s State Aid is in the form of Regional Aid and other aid remains available to enterprises, irrespective of their location. For example, enterprises in Drogheda-Urban LEA and other areas not included on the Regional Aid Map may still avail of Research, Development and Innovation Aid, Environmental Aid, Training Aid, and Consultancy Aid, under the General Block Exemption Regulation.  Aid under the De Minimis Regulation, i.e., aid to an undertaking of less than &euro;200,000 in any rolling 3-year period, offers a further avenue, particularly for smaller sized grants and investments to small enterprises.</p></reply>

As part of this process, my Department has delivered 63% in energy efficiency reductions, the second highest level of all Government Departments, since the public sector energy performance programme commenced over a decade ago. The SEAI publishes these results annually.</p><p>My Department has an active internal cross-Departmental &ldquo;Green Team&rdquo; with over 30 staff across the Department and its Offices, which include the Companies Registration Office, the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Intellectual Property Office of Ireland, the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p>In terms of the internal day-to-day Departmental operations, it is through this &ldquo;Green Team&rdquo;, with functional responsibility at Principal Officer level, that the Department acts to promote and encourage climate action awareness to all staff under the four pillars of energy reduction, water conservation, waste management and ecology, across the eleven buildings occupied by staff of my Department. </p><p>Specifically on energy saving initiatives, my Department has implemented a host of initiatives over the recent past to deliver significant energy savings, amongst which include the following:  </p><p>- Installation of LED lighting and the introduction of motion sensors in many rooms in several buildings so as to reduce electricity usage; </p><p>- The installation of new energy efficiency boiler heating system in 2021; </p><p>- A reduction in the number of personal printers and the introduction of eco-friendly &ldquo;all in one&rdquo; photocopiers and printers;</p><p>- A 75% reduction in the number of electrically powered water coolers across a number of buildings and replacement of same with filtered water systems. </p><p>- Purchase of more eco-friendly ICT equipment and time adjustments to ICT power down of systems;</p><p>- Reduced temperature settings for heating systems, where possible, across of our buildings;</p><p>- Numerous awareness webinars; information sessions and training for staff regarding energy efficiency and wider climate action related issues, including a dedicated Departmental &ldquo;Green Month&rdquo; each year over the past three years.</p><p>In parallel with the energy saving sphere the Department has looked to create awareness and build on its own sustainability options, through logging water usage, annual distribution of seeds to staff country-wide to enhance biodiversity and also our recent installation of beehives on the roof of our Kildare Street building. </p><p>Whilst the Department has made excellent progress in delivering very significant energy savings over recent years, it is recognised that given the ambition of the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Strategy and the energy related consequences arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we continually need to focus on further energy saving initiatives.  </p><p>In that context the Department is currently working closely with the Office of Public Works on the feasibility of installing solar panels on the roof of our building at 23 Kildare Street, the aim of which is to ultimately make the building energy self-sufficient and sustainable.</p><p>In addition, we continue to actively engage directly with, and receive welcome advice from, the DECC and the SEAI in relation to the development of a Departmental Climate Action Mandate for completion later in 2022. As part of this process we are exploring what new energy initiatives, over and above those already implemented, could feasibly be initiated over the period ahead.</p></reply>

This scheme was operated on behalf of the Department by the 31 local authorities, coordinated through their Local Government Management Agency (LGMA). </p><p>Mayo County Council issued &euro;20,220,373 to 3,962 applications approved for the Restart Grant. Any unused funding was returned to the Exchequer. </p><p>Upon final closure of the Scheme, in line with the provisions of the Scheme Service Level Agreements, an independent audit was commissioned to provide reasonable assurance as to the implementation, monitoring and control of the Scheme and reasonable assurance as to the appropriate administration, disbursement and reconciliation of the funding provided by the Exchequer for the Scheme. This is expected to be concluded shortly.</p><p>Under the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC), which was open for application in 2021, Mayo County Council received the following monies over two phases. </p><p>(i) It received an initial allocation of &euro;734,210, of which &euro;521,000 was expended and the remaining &euro;213,210 was then brought forward to phase 2.  </p><p>(ii) In phase 2 of the scheme, the council received an additional &euro;532,137, giving it a total funding for that phase of &euro;745,347. Of this, &euro;361,000 was expended and &euro;384,347 was returned unspent to the Exchequer. </p><p>The total spend over the two phases therefore amounted to &euro;882,000 under the scheme. The SBASC scheme was developed specifically for businesses who were not eligible for CRSS because generally they were not open to the general public, such as wholesalers, caterers, etc. Money was allocated to local authorities on the assumption that such businesses numbered about 20% of CRSS-eligible businesses in each local authority area, which proved to be an overestimate nationwide. Furthermore, the significant reopening of the economy which the government permitted following public health advice from 10 May 2021 also greatly reduced demand for the scheme.  For these reasons, only slightly more than one third of the funds originally sanctioned for the scheme were ultimately spent nationwide. 231 applicants in Mayo benefited from grant aid under the scheme. An independent audit of the scheme is currently in progress and an evaluation will be undertaken at a later date.</p><p>Mayo County Council was approved funding of &euro;15,000 in September 2019 by Enterprise Ireland to undertake a feasibility study under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund. The funding was approved for an options analysis on the former Volex building in Castlebar. In 2020 a business approached Mayo County Council about renting the remaining section of the Volex building. Mayo County Council was amenable to this approach and did not proceed with the Feasibility study. No payment was made by Enterprise Ireland to Mayo County Council under this grant offer.</p><p>The table below sets out the funding allocated to Mayo County Council in respect of their Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) for the period from 1st January 2017 to date. All of this funding allocated has been drawn down and spent. There has been no follow up or appraisal on the funding given under the various programmes or headings. None of the allocated funding has been recouped or unspent. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Allocation &euro;</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>883,450</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>927,979</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>1,092,490</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>1,941,888</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>1,696,431</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 </td>       <td>1,148,467</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Once completed, it is intended to bring the General Scheme to Cabinet as soon as possible. </p><p>Work has also commenced on the drafting of the Terms of Reference for the Employment Law Review Group and organising suitable membership. The immediate focus is to get the Group up and running, initially on a non-statutory basis.</p><p>In terms of Company Law:</p><p>The following recommendations were progressed in the Companies (Rescue Process for Small and Micro Companies) Act 2021, which was commenced in December 2021: </p><p>- Amendment to section 627 to clarify the liquidator has power to bring/defend proceedings before the WRC and Labour Court.</p><p>- Section 587 to oblige the liquidator/director to ensure creditors are made aware they have the right to form and participate in a Committee of Inspection.</p><p>- Section 666 to provide that where a Committee of Inspection is appointed, it shall include at least one employee creditor member.</p><p>Further amendments in respect of the consequences of certain corporate liquidations and restructuring practices, including splitting of corporate operations from asset holding entities in group structures, were considered by the Company Law Review Group last year. The CLRG submitted its report on the matter in December 2021. </p><p>The issues considered in the report are complex and required extensive discussion and analysis by the CLRG. The CLRG ultimately concluded that the incidence of abusive practices in corporate restructuring, while attracting significant attention, is in fact low. This conclusion is supported by the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement which notes that its reviews of liquidations indicate that in over 90% of all liquidations, company directors had acted honestly and responsibly.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, the CLRG made eight recommendations for potential amendment to the Companies Act which are intended to further enhance the regulatory framework. The Report has been considered by officials from my Department in the context of the Plan for Action on Collective Redundancies following Insolvency. Minister Troy has considered their analysis and proposals, and intend for proposed amendments reflecting the consequences of certain corporate liquidations and restructuring practices be carried through a Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p></reply>

My Department is considering the Commission's recommendations in relation to mandatory retirement ages in certain contracts of employment.</p>  <p>  There is no statutory retirement age for employees in Irish legislation, apart from for certain public sector employees where statutory retirement ages may apply. A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the parties.</p>  <p>  Employment equality must be a core consideration in reforms to address mandatory retirement clauses, and the needs of both employees and employers will require consideration and further consultation. In this regard, it will be necessary to liaise closely with employer groups as any changes in this area have potential to have a significant impact on workforce planning, particularly for SMEs.</p>  <p>  Other pension related reforms, such as the national auto-enrolment pension scheme, will be an important tool to address the issues involved.  The delivery of an auto-enrolment pension scheme will make it easier for people to access retirement savings options to help them meet their own income expectations for when they retire and is a current Programme for Government commitment.</p></reply>

One of the main issues raised at that meeting was concern over energy security and prices.</p>  <p>  The Government has already implemented several measures to help ease the impact on enterprises of energy price increases including reductions in VAT and excise on some fuels, as well as a temporary grant scheme to hauliers.</p>  <p>  My Department is part of a whole of Government response to the economic and social impacts of rising energy costs and is leading on the Government response to the business impacts of this, in particular. </p>  <p>  Government Departments have been consulting with stakeholders on specific measures that could be considered to ameliorate the short to medium term challenges to energy security. The Energy Supply Emergency Group is an inter-departmental and inter-agency group with responsibility for informing the Government response to the impact of rising energy costs on business, in addition to security of energy supply more generally, and a longer-term reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on imported oil and gas.</p>  <p>Under the aegis of this Group, my Department has established the Business Energy Users Sub-Group to lead on consultations with business and industry to learn about the specific impacts on Irish businesses, and to hear their concerns and perspectives on the appropriate and most effective tools for policy action. The work of this sub-group, as part of the wider Energy Supply Emergency Group has informed the National Energy Security Framework which was launched by the Government on 13th   April 2022 and which sets out how Government can help households and businesses with their energy security needs in the context of the war in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  In terms of business impacts, the Framework notes the European Commission&rsquo;s recently launched State Aid Temporary Crisis Framework for businesses affected by the energy-related aspects of the Ukraine crisis, and the opportunity that this presents to Member States to consider what specific instruments and supports might be needed in the near-term in order to help vulnerable but viable businesses to overcome the acute impacts of the current crisis. </p>  <p>  In terms of short-term temporary supports for businesses, there are already a number of effective schemes in place resulting from Government&rsquo;s response to the Brexit and Covid-19 crises, and the Government will now be considering whether, and to what degree, such schemes might be pivoted to firms impacted by the Ukraine crisis. In the near term, businesses will be also looking for signals and reassurance that underlying capacity and security of supply issues are being improved in a strategic manner and in collaboration with authorities across the EU and the UK; and the Government will provide clear and practical guidance to business users on ways of maximising their energy efficiency and thus helping to manage overall levels of demand across our energy networks. </p>  <p>  Under the Climate Action Plan, Irish businesses and industry have already embarked on an ambitious plan of action to transition away from fossil fuels and make their operations more efficient and sustainable. This has required a strategic, medium and longer-term approach to business positioning and investment, and the pace of such investment will now need to be accelerated as this can also address Ireland&rsquo;s relative dependency on imported energy, and in doing so, secure our energy future.</p>  <p>  I would also encourage firms to take this opportunity to achieve greater energy efficiency and to begin their decarbonisation transition. For example, the Climate Toolkit for Businesses helps firms understand their current carbon footprint and under the EU's National Recovery and Resilience Fund, later this year we will be able to help SMEs through the Climate Enterprise Action Fund. There are also a range of supports available for business from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to improve energy efficiency and to reduce energy costs.</p></reply>

Ireland was the 19th country in the world to publish such a plan in response to the endorsement of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights by the Human Rights Council in 2011.</p>  <p>  The implementation of this whole-of-government plan was overseen by an implementation group comprised of representatives of Government, civil society and business. Both the plan itself and the programme for Government committed to a review of implementation. This review was undertaken by the Department of Foreign Affairs in consultation with stakeholders during 2021. A draft report was considered at the special session of the multi-stakeholder implementation group on 31 May 2021. This forum included participation by a member of the UN working group on business and human rights, a business and human rights expert from the Danish Institute for Human Rights, and officials from three EU member state Ministries.</p>  <p>  The Government noted the finalised review at its meeting on 3 December 2021. It is published on the Department of Foreign Affairs website: www.dfa.ie/media/dfa/ourrolepolicies/humanrights/Review-of-Implementation-of-National-Plan-on-Business-and-Human-Rights-2017-2020---for-website.docx.pdf</p>  <p>  Discussions have commenced about how to bring a new plan forward. Officials in my Department will proactively engage with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs to provide necessary input into a new plan.</p></reply>

The proposal aims to address the adverse environmental and human rights impacts arising from the operations of companies and those of their subsidiaries and value chains. There will be due diligence obligations on such companies and company directors, when fulfilling their duty to act in the best interest of the company, will be required to take into account the consequences of their decisions on sustainability matters, including, where applicable, human rights, climate change and environmental impacts. Larger companies will be required to adopt a plan to ensure that their business model and strategy is compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and the limiting of global warming to 1.5 &deg;C, in line with the Paris Agreement. The proposed Directive also requires companies to establish procedures to handle complaints from those adversely affected by company operations and from other key stakeholders. The proposal also provides for the designation of supervisory authorities at national level and a civil liability regime in relation to companies who fail to meet their obligations.</p>  <p>  Ireland is supportive of the objective of the proposed Directive which should promote responsible business conduct and we will seek to ensure that the proposals strike the right balance by providing effective protections whilst ensuring that the measures to be implemented by companies are clear, proportionate, and enforceable. It is important that measures such as those proposed are on a cross EU basis in recognition of the complex, international nature of many supply chains and to ensure harmonisation, promote policy coherence, and avoid the risk of fragmentation within the EU single market.</p>  <p>  Consideration of the proposals is at an early stage and is ongoing across EU Member States.

My Department remains committed to ensuring that the interests and rights of all stakeholders are appropriately protected under the proposals.</p>  <p>  Given the complexity of the issues being addressed, negotiations at EU level may well continue through the remainder of this year and into 2023.

Examples of key measures include:</p>  <p>  - The establishment of the new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, offering increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump (up from the current level of 30-35%). </p>  <p>  - Establishment of a network of registered One Stop Shops to offer a hassle-free, start-to-finish project management service, including access to financing, for home energy upgrades.</p>  <p>  - A special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation for all households, to urgently reduce energy use as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to current exceptionally high energy prices.</p>  <p>  I recognise that rental properties can present a specific challenge for energy efficiency improvements. This is an issue found in most countries where the incentives to invest in energy upgrades can be misaligned between landlords and tenants. Therefore, homes, built and occupied pre-2011, and owned by non-corporate landlords are eligible for these new measures. This will mean that the national housing stock is upgraded, emissions will reduce and tenants get lower energy bills and a healthier, more comfortable place to live.  </p>  <p>  It is also intended that non-corporate landlords will be able to avail of the planned low-cost loan scheme for retrofit when it is launched later this year. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Housing for All Strategy which is being led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage includes a commitment to introduce minimum energy standards for rental properties from 2025.</p></reply>

However, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity sector is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which is an independent regulator. The CRU was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity sector following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 and subsequent legislation. The CRU is an independent statutory body and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. As Minister, I therefore have no function in this matter.</p><p>In line with long standing policy on deregulating price setting, CRU ended its regulation of retail prices in the electricity market in 2011, and in the gas market in 2014. Given that prices are no longer regulated, they are set by all suppliers as entirely commercial and operational matters by them. Each such company has its own different approach to pricing decisions over time, in accordance with factors such as their overall company strategic direction and developments in their cost base.</p><p>Additionally, the Deputy may wish to note that CRU provide a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them to raise day to day questions on regulatory matters directly to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s target to achieve 5GW by 2030 will be primarily met off our eastern and southern coasts. This reflects the suitability of water depths in these regions for deployment of fixed bottom offshore wind turbines and the availability of electricity grid infrastructure capacity.The Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021 provides the legal underpinning for an entirely new marine planning system, which will balance harnessing our huge offshore wind potential while protecting our rich and unique marine environment. Ahead of the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA) in 2023, the legislation provides, on an interim basis, the legal authority for the Minister of the Environment, Climate and Communications, to assess Maritime Area Consent (MAC) applications from offshore renewable energy developers who meet defined assessment criteria.</p><p>I recently announced the launch of this application window, beginning 25 April for an 8-week period. The first Maritime Area Consents are expected to be issued in the second half of 2022. The process will assess applicants in key areas, including financial and technical competency. This will ensure that only the most viable offshore projects can apply for permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will include full environmental assessment and public participation.</p><p>This approach ensures that immediate progress can be made in progressing offshore wind energy, while Maritime Area Regulatory Authority is being established. Following assessment of the initial batch of Maritime Area Consents, which will be located primarily off our eastern coast, responsibility will be handed over to Maritime Area Regulatory Authority from early 2023.</p><p>In tandem, my Department is designing a pathway, based on consultation feedback, for a second batch of projects to progress through the new consenting system, upon establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority. </p></reply>

Activity under the scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID pandemic, when construction activity was paused for approximately 12 months in total. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2021, the average cycle time from application to completion was approximately 27 months. While this delay was largely driven by COVID related issues, the deeper measures being provided under the scheme, also involve more substantive works.</p><p>This is a top priority for my Department and SEAI and in order to reduce this timeline to completion and target a monthly average of 400 completions this year, the following actions have already been taken:</p><p>- The budget, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund;</p><p>- SEAI has been allocated additional staff for the Warmer Homes Scheme;</p><p>- SEAI is working to Increase contractor output through active contract engagement and management.  </p><p>There are currently just over 6,000 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor or are awaiting the initial survey of their home.  </p><p>The following tables set out the number of completions achieved on a monthly basis in 2021 and 2022 and the yearly numbers from 2017 onwards.</p><p><b>2021 Warmer Homes </b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Jan</th>       <th>Feb</th>       <th>Mar</th>       <th>Apr</th>       <th>May</th>       <th>Jun</th>       <th>Jul</th>       <th>Aug</th>       <th>Sept</th>       <th>Oct</th>       <th>Nov</th>       <th>Dec</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>36</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>46</td>       <td>110</td>       <td>151</td>       <td>246</td>       <td>211</td>       <td>194</td>       <td>302</td>       <td>254</td>       <td>288</td>       <td>320</td>       <td>2,126</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>2022 Warmer Homes</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Jan</th>       <th>Feb</th>       <th>Mar</th>       <th>Apr</th>       <th>May</th>       <th>Jun</th>       <th>Jul</th>       <th>Aug</th>       <th>Sept</th>       <th>Oct</th>       <th>Nov</th>       <th>Dec</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>193</td>       <td>244</td>       <td>320</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>757</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Warmer Homes</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6,554</td>       <td>5,255</td>       <td>3,142</td>       <td>1,524</td>       <td>2,126</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Climate Action Plan 2021 commits Ireland to installing up to 8GW of onshore wind and at least 5GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, in order to support the reduction in Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.     </p>  <p>  The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is the main Government support to deliver these onshore and offshore wind targets. RESS includes a mandated Community Benefit Fund payment, valued at &euro;2 per MWh of electricity generated, which guarantees local community participation and benefit in all projects supported by RESS. The scheme will be supplemented by the new Micro-Generation Support Scheme to facilitate communities further in their energy transition. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made to date in advancing offshore wind. The enactment of the Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021, establishes a well-regulated and inclusive consenting process which includes meaningful community engagement. The Act also balances the harnessing of our huge offshore wind potential with protecting our marine environment. The application process for Maritime Area Consents (MACs), which will be issued to projects on foot of the MAP legislation, opens later this month. In respect of the decommissioning of infrastructure, the MAP Act also sets out obligations on holders of a MAC in relation to the rehabilitation of the maritime area. </p>  <p>  Preparations are also now advanced to launch, later this year, Ireland's first auction specifically for offshore wind projects, ORESS 1. Community Benefit Fund payment obligations for ORESS 1 projects will commence from an early stage of project development, before commercial operation. </p>  <p>  Work is also underway to develop a pathway for offshore development post-2030 and a revised Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP II) is currently in progress. This will identify the most suitable areas for the sustainable development of fixed and floating wind, wave, and tidal technologies in the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), while also considering other maritime activities and marine biodiversity. The Government is pursuing a responsible level of urgency to address our renewable energy commitments, particularly in the light of recent cost pressures and the need to reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels, particularly following the tragic events unfolding in Ukraine.</p></reply>

I am advised by NBI that as of 15 April 2022, over 319,000 premises have now been surveyed and almost 172,000 premises are under construction or complete across 26 counties. I am further advised that almost 64,000 premises are now available to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 22 counties, with over 47,100 premises passed across 19 counties and available for immediate connection. In addition to the premises completed, build is underway on over 124,600 premises, demonstrating the project is reaching scale. NBI has confirmed that over 9,800 premises have been connected, as of 15 April, and this is increasing on a daily basis. To date, the level of connections is in line with projections and some areas are exceeding targets.</p>  <p>  In line with a remedial plan to address Covid-19 related delays which was agreed with my Department in April 2021, following detailed engagement, NBI had expected to have almost 60,000 premises passed by the end of January 2022. Challenges were encountered with the build process and also as a result of Covid-19 impacts. NBI continues to work with its network and build partners to address all issues as they arise. The Department has worked with NBI to agree an Updated Interim Remedial Plan (UIRP) which recalibrates the targets for 2022 to take account of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and other delays to the Programme, with a revised target of 102,000 premises passed by the end of January 2023 (Contract Year 3).</p>  <p>  It remains the ambition of the Government to rollout the National Broadband Plan State led intervention as quickly as possible, and to achieve this NBI will continue its focus on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the build programme gets back on track and is building momentum.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity sector is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which is an independent regulator. The CRU was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity sector following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. The CRU is an independent statutory body and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. As Minister, I therefore have no function in this matter.</p><p>In line with long standing policy on deregulating price setting, CRU ended its regulation of retail prices in the electricity market in 2011, and in the gas market in 2014. Given that prices are no longer regulated, they are set by all suppliers as entirely commercial and operational matters by them.

An Post has statutory responsibility for the State&rsquo;s postal service and the post office network. In addition, Irish post offices are typically independent businesses that are run by postmasters. Decisions relating to the network, including those in relation to the size, distribution and future of the network are operational matters for the Board and management of the company. The Government is committed to a sustainable An Post and post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure throughout Ireland. The company fully understands the Government position and a sustainable, viable and customer-focused post office network is a key strategic priority for the company. </p>  <p>  The transformation programme that was agreed with the Irish Postmasters Union in 2018, was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. An Post introduced the pandemic recovery fund in 2021, which was worth &euro;8.5 million over an 18-month period. This commenced on 1 July 2021 and will continue until the end of this year. The Government recognises the importance of the high value and high quality post office network to our citizens right across the country, as well as the central and trusted role of postmasters in our communities. An Post, including through the post office network provides important services to its customers and it is contracted to provide key Government services to citizens. </p>  <p>  The work of the interdepartmental group, which was established to consider the feasibility of the new Government services, is being considered at present and the report of the Group will be brought to Government when all options have been considered. While decisions relating to the network are matters for the board and the management of the company, they continue to engage with the IPU on operational matters. The Government is committed to ensuring that An Post continues to play a vital role. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have ongoing engagement with the company, with other Departments and with key stakeholders to explore all options, in line with this commitment.</p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 145,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme. In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household had increased to &euro;17,620.Activity under the scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID pandemic, when construction activity was paused for approximately 12 months in total, and access to properties during restricted periods, in line with Government guidelines, was challenging. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2021, the average cycle time from application to completion was approximately 27 months. While this delay was largely driven by COVID related issues, the deeper measures being provided under the scheme since 2018, also involve more substantive works.</p><p>This is a top priority for my Department and SEAI and in order to reduce this timeline to completion and target a monthly average of 400 completions this year, the following actions have already been taken:- The budget, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund;</p><p>- SEAI has been allocated additional staff for the Warmer Homes Scheme;</p><p>- SEAI is working to Increase contractor output through active contract engagement and management.</p><p>Any necessary further measures identified as required by SEAI to increase output under this key Scheme will also be taken.</p></reply>

The review of the National Development Plan (NDP) resulted in an unprecedented financial commitment to support achievement of the Government&rsquo;s retrofit targets. A total of &euro;8 billion of Exchequer funding (including &euro;5 billion in carbon tax revenues) will be available to support residential upgrades to 2030.   This year, total funding of &euro;267 million has been allocated to the SEAI for residential and community retrofit schemes and the Solar PV scheme, of which, &euro;202 million is carbon tax receipts. This funding allocation will be used to support 27,000 home energy upgrades across all schemes including 8,640 homes to a post-works Building Energy Rating (BER) of B2. The individual SEAI schemes will contribute to meeting this B2 target.  </p>  <p>  Achieving B2 status for homeowners is central to the recently launched National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme which introduces a new, highly customer centric, way to undertake home upgrades. SEAI registered One-Stop-Shops will provide an end-to-end service for homeowners. This includes surveying; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors; and quality assurance. The Scheme offers unprecedented grant levels, increased from around 30% to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump.</p></reply>

ComReg advises that the current minimum coverage obligations in those licences are being considerably exceeded by all operators. Capital investment by telecommunications operators over the last 5 years was in the order of &euro;3.3 billion for both fixed and mobile services. This has significantly enhanced the availability of services, both voice and data, throughout Ireland, including in rural areas.ComReg is currently in the process of running another Multi-band Spectrum Award to assign rights of use in four spectrum bands. The award comprises 470 MHz of spectrum and represents a 46% increase in the harmonised spectrum assigned for the provision of wireless broadband services in Ireland. This will significantly enable the market to provide improved services to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data and new services. The proposals include significant coverage obligations for prospective winning bidders.  </p><p>To assist consumers to choose the network provider that best meets their needs, ComReg has developed a national outdoor coverage map (available at this <i>link</i>). This map provides consumers with very clear information on where operators have good 2G, 3G and 4G coverage. </p><p>The Shared Rural Network programme which sees the UK Government working in partnership with the four UK mobile network operators was developed to improve digital infrastructure and increase connectivity. This is similar to the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce ('the Taskforce') which has been in operation since 2016 and has been a driving force for improving access to telecommunications services nationwide. It has completed over 70 targeted actions to alleviate connectivity barriers and continues to tackle issues impeding the rollout of mobile and fixed connectivity. The Taskforce is co-managed by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD). </p><p>Relevant links associated with the work of the Taskforce can be found at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/db7f83-mobile-phone-and-broadband-taskforce/. </p></reply>

This decision did not impose a moratorium on data centres, but rather directed the System Operators to implement a set of assessment criteria by which to process data centre grid connection applications. Given the constraint situation in the greater Dublin Region, and the number of data centres applying for connection to the greater Dublin Region, the CRU considered it necessary to introduce a locational criterion in the Directions to the SOs which requires the SOs to take into consideration the effects of connecting data centres inside constrained areas before further processing data centre applications, in order to mitigate further constraint issues in this area and any other area that may be identified by the SOs as constrained in future. In addition, under the Climate Action Plan 2021, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has also committed to reviewing the 2018 'Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy' to ensure alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets, sectoral emissions ceilings and climate priorities. My Department is working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and relevant state agencies to ensure that there is a plan-led, regionally balanced approach to large developments such as data centres, taking into account congestion, existing grid availability and the opportunity to co-locate significant renewable energy opportunities. As transmission system operator, EirGrid is one of the stakeholders inputting to this review. The statement is due for publication later this year.</p></reply>

They will introduce minimum standards that will apply across all solid fuels, to ensure that the most polluting can no longer be made available on the Irish market and to assist the public in transitioning to less polluting alternatives. The new regulations are necessary as each year, some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning. It is estimated that there are over 16,200 life years lost, while many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution.    I am acutely aware of recent increases in energy costs due to increases internationally and, more recently, due to the crisis in the Ukraine. However, the Domestic Fuel Cost Comparison reports, published quarterly by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, consistently show that low smoke ovoids are more cost-efficient than other types of coal, peat and wood logs, in terms of heat delivered per unit cost. </p>  <p>  I made the announcement one year ahead of the introduction of new regulations to provide industry and retailers with sufficient notice to run down existing stocks, and to make appropriate arrangements regarding supplies for the 2022/23 heating season. My Department are in ongoing communication with industry representatives and retailer groups, to ensure they are prepared for the introduction of the new regulations.</p></reply>

An integrated, structured, and evidence-based approach to identify and plan our response to just climate transition requirements.2. People are equipped with the right skills to be able to participate in and benefit from the future net zero economy.3. The costs are shared so that the impact is equitable and existing inequalities are not exacerbated.4. Social dialogue to ensure impacted citizens and communities are empowered and are core to the transition process.As set out in CAP 2021, this framework should be considered by all relevant Ministers in the process of climate action policy formulation and implementation, including  ensuring that response measures support all aspects of achieving a just transition. This includes creating sustainable employment opportunities, providing reskilling and retraining opportunities, and providing appropriate supports for those most vulnerable as part of Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a climate neutral economy.</p>  <p>  The Government has also committed, in CAP 2021, to establishing a statutory Just Transition Commission, with the general scheme of legislation to establish the Commission to be completed by the end of this year. CAP 2021 sets out that the purpose of the Commission will be to provide strategic advice to Government (integrating its role with existing governance and engagement structures) on how Government policy can further a just transition. I am currently progressing the development of proposals on the mandate of the Commission in advance of preparing the general scheme of legislation. In light of the role that he has performed as Just Transition Commissioner during in the Midlands Region since 2019, I have also asked Kieran Mulvey to continue to act in an advisory role, providing support to me on the development of proposals for the statutory Commission.</p></reply>

In particular, the invasion has triggered a decision by the European Union to phase out its dependency on Russian gas, oil and coal imports as soon as possible. It will also impact where and how we source that energy and will change how we design energy policy to ensure the system&rsquo;s long-term resilience.The National Energy Security Framework, published in April 2022, is a response to the challenges of ensuring the ongoing and long-term security of affordable energy supply. The Framework provides a single overarching and initial response to address Ireland&rsquo;s energy security needs in the context of the war in Ukraine. It coordinates work connected to energy security across the electricity, gas and oil sectors and sets out a &lsquo;Whole-of Government&rsquo; response to the challenges posed to energy security and energy affordability. </p><p>The development of this Framework has taken account of the need to decarbonise our society and economy as set out in recent reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Ireland&rsquo;s targets to reduce emissions by 51% over the decade to 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050 as set out in the Climate Action Plan. The Framework sets out the Government&rsquo;s action in response to these issues across key themes:-managing the impact on consumers and businesses;</p><p>-ensuring security of energy supply in the near-term;</p><p>-reducing our dependency on imported fossil fuels.</p><p>Regarding the exploration of gas offshore, it would not be appropriate for me to engage directly with companies who have submitted applications related to their petroleum authorisations while such applications are under consideration by my Department.</p></reply>

There are no plans at present to introduce such legislation. There is provision, however, under sections 107 or 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 to deal with the issue of nuisance noise from a range of sources, including agricultural sources.My Department has produced an information leaflet, A Guide to the Noise Regulations, on the legal remedies open to a person experiencing nuisance noise. The guide can be downloaded from the following link:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/service/make-a-noise-nuisance-complaint/</p><p>The legislation also provides that a Local Authority can take action against a person causing nuisance noise. A National Protocol for Dealing with Noise Complaints for Local Authorities was developed as a cooperative project between my Department, Local Authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Protocol provides guidance to Local Authorities, given existing legislation, as to what is considered best practice for dealing with noise complaints.

NBI has also confirmed that as of 15 April 2022, almost 64,000 premises are now available to order or pre-order across 22 counties, with over 47,100 premises passed across 19 counties and available for immediate connection. NBI has further advised that 9,800 premises have been connected, as of 15 April, and this is increasing on a daily basis. To date, the level of connections is in line with projections and some areas are exceeding expectations.</p><p>My Department worked with NBI to agree<font color="#FF0000"> </font>an Updated Interim Remedial Plan (UIRP), which recalibrates the targets for 2022 to take account of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and other delays to the Programme, with a revised target of 102,000 premises passed by the end of January 2023 (Contract Year 3), which was agreed earlier this month. The focus for 2022 is to continue to build momentum and catch up on earlier delays. NBI has expressed confidence to my Department that it can achieve this target. My Department will continue to monitor closely the delivery of the NBP Programme and progress on the delivery of the UIRP targets over the course of 2022.</p><p>It remains the ambition of the Government to rollout the National Broadband Plan State led intervention as quickly as possible, and to achieve this NBI will continue its focus on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p></reply>

The most recently published data covers the period to end 2020 and shows that my Department had by then achieved a cumulative 49.3% energy improvement since the 2006-2008 baseline period.  In 2017, the Department launched the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy (PSEES) which was approved by Government to support the additional effort needed to meet the 2020 target to<font color="#FF0000"> </font>reduce energy consumption.  The group headed by the Department comprises 16 bodies and is one of the strongest performing groups, having achieved 45% energy efficiency to end 2020. My Department and the wider group is now focused on the new target to deliver an energy efficiency improvement of 50% by 2030. </p><p>Special measures being taken by my Department at this time include the following: </p><p>- Daily monitoring of the building heating systems to take account of staff attendance  </p><p>- A reduction in the time schedules/thermostat temperature on the building heating controls. </p><p>- Encouraging staff where possible to walk, cycle or use public transport to get to the Department&rsquo;s offices and in conducting official business. </p><p>As well as the above the following measures are ongoing in the Department.</p><p>-  Participation in the OPW Optimising Power @ Work (OP@W) initiative with ongoing engagement by staff with the OPW appointed energy consultant to monitor gas and electricity use. </p><p>-  Continued participation in the SEAI Monitoring and Reporting programme for the period 2021-2030. The 2021 energy returns for the Department are currently being compiled for submission to the SEAI database.  </p><p>-  The Department is currently preparing its 2022 Resource Efficiency Action Plan (REAP) which will report on energy, water and waste usage in the Department for 2021 and identify actions that can be taken to reduce usage for the following years. </p><p>-An established Green Team to drive energy efficiency and staff awareness in our buildings including the hosting of energy awareness days and the displaying of  efficiency notices throughout the buildings.</p><p>-The Department has established a New HQ Consultative Group to facilitate staff input to the new building and to ensure ideas on energy and resource efficiency are considered by the OPW architects and build team. </p><p>-Work on the deep retrofit refurbishment of the Departments new HQ is currently underway which when completed will see the building with a BER of A2 which given the age of the building is very impressive.</p></reply>

Energy efficiency measures are central to addressing the root causes of energy poverty, and may also be an effective preventative intervention to improve cold-related health impacts. Creating healthy indoor living environments with healthy air temperatures, humidity levels, noise levels, and improved air quality can support good physical and mental health.   The Climate Action Plan and National Retrofit Plan set ambitious targets to retrofit the equivalent of 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings by the end of 2030. These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland. The National Development and National Retrofit Plans have ring-fenced &euro;8 billion to support the achievement of this objective. This will be supplemented by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage budget for retrofitting 36,500 local authority homes.</p>  <p>  This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. Grants are also available for those who can afford to contribute to the cost of retrofitting their home. Up to 50% of the typical cost of a whole home retrofit to a B2 Building Energy Rating is available, as well as individual grants covering up to 80% of the typical cost of some measures.  These supports will make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills.</p>  <p>  The Warmth and Wellbeing scheme, funded by my Department, and operated by the SEAI and the HSE aims to objectively measure and validate the health and wellbeing impacts of improving the living conditions of vulnerable people living in energy poverty with chronic respiratory conditions. An independent analysis of the scheme benefits is being carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in collaboration with the HSE.</p></reply>

Lower income households living in inefficient homes are more at risk of energy poverty when energy prices increase, as the proportion of their income needed to meet their energy needs increases.The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place to support households who are at risk of energy poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance, the Household Benefits Package and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. The Government has also put in place a number of additional measures earlier this year to address the increasing cost of energy including:</p><p>&middot;Following on from the Budget 2022 increase in the weekly rate of the Fuel Allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33 a week so that &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter, an additional lump-sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to the 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance in mid-March. </p><p>&middot;All residential electricity customers will see the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;200 (incl. VAT) credited to their accounts. </p><p>&middot;The National Retrofit Scheme includes specific measures to support householders in taking actions to reduce energy bills, including up to 80% grant funding for low-cost, high-impact measures such as attic insulation. </p><p>To further manage the impact of recent price increases the Government, in the recently published National Energy Security Framework, has also announced a number of additional supports for consumers and businesses including:</p><p>-A new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons.</p><p>-A package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt in the electricity and gas sectors.</p><p>-A review of the price-drivers behind electricity and natural gas bills (including network costs) with a view to mitigating cost increases for consumers and businesses in the near term.</p><p>-The continuation of the excise duty reduction on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil until the Budget in October 2022.</p><p>-A reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.</p><p>-An additional payment of &euro;100 for all recipients of the Fuel Allowance.</p><p>-The reduction to zero of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy on electricity bills.</p><p>In addition to the measures outlined above, the electricity and gas markets, which are overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, have a range of protections against disconnections in place for consumers. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly, any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance available.</p><p>A research network on fuel poverty chaired by the Economic and Social Research Institute was established in 2021. The group consists of representatives from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Social Protection, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has commenced examination of the data and metrics needed to improve existing measures for fuel poverty in Ireland. The main goal is to provide insights that enhance policy design to protect vulnerable households. A work programme, proposed outputs and timelines will be agreed and finalised shortly.</p></reply>

These Regulations create an obligation on suppliers to offer the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff to new and existing micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment for excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflective of the market value. I are aware that some suppliers have already advertised their CEG tariffs.The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG which outlines the arrangements for the implementation of the CEG, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. More information is available here: www.cru.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CRU21131-Interim-Clean-Export-Guarantee-Decision-Paper.pdf. Micro-generators who wish to become eligible should register for an export grid connection from ESB Networks (Micro-Generators (esbnetworks.ie)) and have a smart meter where applicable (Smart Meter Upgrade FAQs (esbnetworks.ie)).</p><p>The CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. Once eligible, customers can expect an initial payment or credit from their suppliers from 1 July depending on billing cycle. The CRU has asked suppliers to communicate their decision on when initial Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) payments will be made &ndash; at the earliest opportunity.The CRU encourages customers to contact their supplier to obtain information on their suppliers CEG tariff arrangements.</p><p>In addition,the phased introduction of supports has already begun with the commencement by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) of the MSS domestic solar PV grant on 16 February last.</p></reply>

The supports include a new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme offering increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump (up from the previous level of 30-35%). SEAI registered One-Stop-Shops will provide an end-to-end service for homeowners through this scheme.   When a homeowner is completing a whole home energy upgrade, the overall fabric of the home is assessed through the home energy survey and assessment. The assessment may recommend upgrading certain measures to ensure that home achieves a B2 rating or is suitable for installation of a heat pump. It is in these situations that certain measures, such as floor insulation, which are not available as an individual grant measure, are eligible for support through the One-Stop-Shop service. The provision of these additional measures as part of a whole home energy upgrade, represents a continuation of the approach that was previously in place under schemes like the Community Energy Grants scheme as opposed to any change in policy.</p>  <p>  The Government has made it clear that it is important that households that want or need to carry out the upgrade over time instead of all at once, should also be supported. For that reason, the new enhanced grant rates have also been applied to the individual measure grants allowing homeowners to take a step-by-step approach or self-manage the project. A special grant covering 80% of the cost of attic and cavity wall insulation has also been made available as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to increases in the cost of living.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emissions reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible. The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were selected as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners as well as the best value for money for the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  The impact of the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme will be monitored on an ongoing basis by the SEAI and the Department. A comprehensive evaluation measuring effectiveness and value will also take place in 2023 and will inform future developments.</p></reply>

These Regulations mean the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff is now available for new and existing micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflective of the market value.The Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) domestic solar PV grant scheme commenced on the 16th February. Domestic applicants can apply to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for a grant towards the cost of installing solar PV equipment, up to a maximum of &euro;2,400 in 2022. Changes to the MSS scheme include the removal of the minimum post-works Building Energy Rating (BER) C requirement, homes built pre-2021 are now eligible and there is no need to install a battery to avail of the maximum grant. With the introduction of the CEG tariff, residual electricity not consumed on the premises is now eligible for an export payment which further supports the investment.</p><p>Following a public consultation, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG on 1 December 2021.This decision outlines the interim arrangements for the implementation of the CEG, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. The CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis.</p><p>Furthermore, a tax disregard of &euro;200 was introduced in Budget 2021 in respect of personal income received by households who sell residual renewable electricity, which they generate, back to the grid.</p></reply>

In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have risen and remained high since the second half of 2020. Gas prices are now unprecedently high, with UK wholesale gas prices recently reaching record levels. The increase in international wholesale gas prices have continued to be driven to unprecedentedly high levels by the volatility in the international gas market caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These gas increases feed directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.</p><p>Government&rsquo;s immediate response to address the increase in domestic energy prices has been to utilise the tax and social welfare system to counter rising costs of living. Government actions include an increase to the Fuel Allowance in Budget 2022, the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment where domestic accounts are now seeing &euro;176.22 exclusive of VAT credited to their accounts. This &euro;400 million measure is in addition to the range of measures introduced on 10 February to address increasing costs of living, including the lump sum payment for people on the Fuel Allowance of &euro;125, which was paid to 372,000 households in March.</p><p>On 13 April, in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, government launched the National Energy Security Framework which includes a further &euro;100 Fuel Allowance payment to be made to all recipients of the Fuel Allowance in quarter 2 of this year, a new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons and a reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October.</p><p>The Deputy may find the following document helpful as it details the allocations from the carbon tax for the decade: assets.gov.ie/201264/5c96e5cd-b663-4887-bf2e-e13a393ffc50.pdf</p></reply>

The RESS supports communities in a variety of ways including through a separate category for community projects and a mandatory community benefit fund for every project supported in the scheme.    The Climate Action Plan includes a target for at least 500MW of renewable electricity to be supplied by local community-based projects; to reach this target it is estimated that at least 100 community projects will be needed. In order to ensure such a pipeline of community projects I have allocated &euro;2 million in capital funding in Budget 2022 to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). </p>  <p>  This funding will enable SEAI to deploy a range of capacity-building supports including toolkit guides to assist communities in developing renewable projects. The first four of these, covering grid connection, Solar PV, the planning process and onshore wind, are available on the SEAI website, with more to be developed in the coming months. A trusted intermediary service is also now in place to assist community projects. A trusted advisory service, for expert financial, grid and planning advice, and financial enabling grant supports are to be delivered in quarter two of 2022. This advisory service will also provide feasibility studies for all community projects to assess their planning and grid connection methods. </p>  <p>  A supportive spatial planning framework for onshore renewable electricity generation development, including community energy projects, is critical to meeting the targets set out in Climate Action Plan. 2021. The SEAI is currently undertaking a review and update of the methodology for Local Authority Renewable Electricity Strategies to provide a best practice approach to identifying and assessing renewable energy resources in spatial planning at local authority level.</p></reply>

SEAI registered One-Stop-Shops will provide an end-to-end service for homeowners. This includes surveying; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors; and quality assurance. The Scheme offers unprecedented grant levels, increased from circa 30% to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump.    Homes upgraded under the scheme must reach a post works BER rating of B2 or better and all homes must deliver a minimum primary energy uplift of at least 100 kWh/m2/year. As such it is expected that homeowners will typically complete a deeper whole home energy upgrade of the overall fabric of the property. </p>  <p>  When a homeowner is completing a whole home energy upgrade, the overall fabric of the building is assessed through the home energy survey and assessment. The assessment may recommend a range of upgrade measures to ensure that the home achieves a B2 rating or is suitable for installation of a heat pump.</p>  <p>  For this reason, it is necessary to provide a wider range of grant supports for measures compared to the current offerings under other SEAI Energy Upgrade Schemes. Under the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme, grants are available for Home Energy Assessments; Heat Pumps; Wall and Roof Insulation; Solar PV; Windows and Doors; Ventilation Systems; and Project Management. </p></reply>

They will introduce minimum standards that will apply across all solid fuels, to ensure that the most polluting can no longer be made available on the Irish market and to assist the public in transitioning to less polluting alternatives. New measures are required to improve air quality and protect public health. It is estimated that each year, some 1,300 people die prematurely in Ireland due to air pollution from solid fuel burning and that there are over 16,200 life years lost. In addition, many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution. The regulations are a critical element of addressing this public health and environmental challenge and will serve to improve the quality of the air that we breathe, and the health of the public that we serve.</p><p>I am acutely aware of recent increases in energy costs due to increases internationally and, more recently, due to the crisis in Ukraine. The purpose of new solid fuel regulations is to ensure that better quality, more efficient fuels will be available on the market. Low smoke ovoids are a suitable cost-efficient alternative to other types of high polluting coal, peat and wood logs, in terms of heat delivered per cent cost. </p><p>While there is no detailed information available regarding the number of people who purchase peat, the 2016 census data indicates that approximately 5.4% of households relied upon peat as a main heating fuel, though this varies significantly at a county level. Nationally it is estimated that 128ktoe of peat are used for heating purposes.</p><p>The primary focus of these regulations is on the large-scale commercial sale of turf. I recognise that turf cutting by citizens for use in their own homes is a traditional activity across many peatland areas. Measures are required to reduce the emissions associated with burning peat, but which respect these traditions. No ban on the burning of peat will be introduced for those with rights to harvest sod peat, but measures are required to reduce its availability in more urban areas where the greatest harm can be caused. To that end, provision is proposed to prohibit the commercial sale of sod peat in areas with higher population density while allowing for traditional distribution in rural areas. This approach will facilitate those with turbary rights and traditional rural usage to continue to cut and burn sod peat for their own domestic purposes, while also reducing the use of sod peat in urban areas.</p><p>Final regulations will be agreed by Government in due course that will ensure, that while measures are introduced to enhance the quality of our air, they will not impinge upon traditional local practices associated with sod peat.</p></reply>

Since 2000, over 143,000 free upgrades have been supported by the SEAI administered scheme. A budget allocation of &euro;109 million has been provided for this scheme this year. This will support an increase in the number of free home upgrades, from an average of 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month this year, helping to reduce waiting times. In February, the Government announced its intention to target the worst performing properties under the scheme, by prioritising homes that were built and occupied before 1993 and have a pre-works BER of E, F or G. Existing applications will not be affected by this change. Properties that burn solid fuels are far more likely to be in these worse-performing BER ratings.    The Government also recently launched a package of significantly improved supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills and lower emissions. The supports include a new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme offering increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical B2 home energy upgrade with a heat pump (up from the previous level of 30-35%). A special enhanced grant rate, equivalent to 80% of the typical cost, for attic and cavity wall insulation, has also been introduced to urgently reduce energy use as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to current exceptionally high energy prices.

BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload.  Under State aid rules, my Department is not permitted to displace commercial investment by intervening in areas where commercial investment exists or is planned, as to do so would be an infringement of these State aid rules. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard. </p>  <p>  Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance.

On the 15 February this year I signed the Regulations (Statutory Instrument 76 of 2022) that transpose Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive into Irish law. These Regulations create an obligation on suppliers to offer the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff to new and existing micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment for excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflective of the market value. I are aware that some suppliers have already advertised their CEG tariffs.</p><p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG which outlines the arrangements for the implementation of the CEG, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. More information is available here: www.cru.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CRU21131-Interim-Clean-Export-Guarantee-Decision-Paper.pdf. Micro-generators who wish to become eligible for the CEG should register for an export grid connection from ESB Networks and have a smart meter installed where applicable.</p><p>  The CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. Once eligible, customers can expect an initial payment or credit from their suppliers from 1 July depending on their billing cycle, backdated to their date of eligibility or the 15 February, whichever is the latest. The CRU has asked suppliers to communicate their decision on when initial CEG payments will be made at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>  ESB Networks have confirmed that by the end of March 2022 approximately 21,000 micro-generators are accruing the value of the CEG for the electricity they export to the grid via their smart meter.</p></reply>

This project will improve Ireland&rsquo;s ambient air quality management capabilities, by using an air quality modelling system to gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to poor air quality, and to develop a system that will provide more comprehensive information to the public.

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 15 April 2022, over 319,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with almost 172,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are now connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and almost 64,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 22 counties.  In County Limerick surveying is complete in the Deployment Area of Hospital, main works are underway in the Deployment Area of Adare and network build is complete in the Deployment Area of Limerick, with over 7,000 premises under construction or complete, and over 2,500 premises available to order or pre order a high speed broadband connection.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Limerick through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 15 April 2022, 553 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Limerick 13 BCPs have been installed to date including Cappamore Community Centre, which is approximately 6.7km from the premises referred to. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.  </p>  <p>  In County Limerick 13 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access.

An Post has statutory responsibility for the State&rsquo;s postal service and the post office network. In addition, Irish post offices are typically independent businesses that are run by postmasters. Decisions relating to the network, including those in relation to the size, distribution and future of the network are operational matters for the Board and management of the company. The Government is committed to a sustainable An Post and post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure throughout Ireland. The company fully understands the Government position and a sustainable, viable and customer-focused post office network is a key strategic priority for the company.    The transformation programme that was agreed with the Irish Postmasters Union in 2018, was impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. An Post introduced the pandemic recovery fund in 2021, which was worth &euro;8.5 million over an 18-month period. This commenced on 1 July 2021 and will continue until the end of this year. The Government recognises the importance of the high value and high quality post office network to our citizens right across the country, as well as the central and trusted role of postmasters in our communities. An Post, including through the post office network provides important services to its customers and it is contracted to provide key Government services to citizens. </p>  <p>  The work of the interdepartmental group, which was established to consider the feasibility of the new Government services, is being considered at present and the report of the Group will be brought to Government when all options have been considered. While decisions relating to the network are matters for the board and the management of the company, they continue to engage with the IPU on operational matters. The Government is committed to ensuring that An Post continues to play a vital role. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have ongoing engagement with the company, with other Departments and with key stakeholders to explore all options, in line with this commitment.</p></reply>

Any additional use of the site would need to have regard to that important priority in addition to the relevant operational and safety considerations. </p>  <p>  A review of the design of the site for use for additional parking of HGVs is complete. This  then had to be reviewed in the light of the recent decision by Revenue Commissioners to move its mobile scanner to the Kilrane site to facilitate the establishment within the port of a Reception centre for persons arriving from Ukraine. My Department has engaged with the relevant agencies to assess the feasibility of providing the additional parking on a designated area within the Kilrane site. A Health and Safety assessment is to be carried out shortly by Transport Infrastructure Ireland on the proposed designated area.

This is in line with the target of 5GW of offshore wind by 2030 and the potential of at least 30GW of floating offshore wind power thereafter, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan 2021.</p>  <p>  Following consideration of that assessment, my colleague Minister Ryan announced last December the publication of a Policy Statement setting out the strategy for commercial ports to facilitate offshore renewable energy activity in the seas around Ireland. A number of ports, both large ones for construction and deployment and smaller ports for operations and maintenance activities, will be required to provide facilities for the different activities at several locations around the country and for the various phases of the fixed and floating ORE developments.</p>  <p>  This will ultimately allow investments that are commercially viable in the long-term progress without undermining the ability of any port to meet its primary obligations in relation to the facilitation of international trade.</p>  <p>  This will also maximise the economic benefits at both regional and national level in terms of job creation and new SME enterprises in areas such as engineering, fabrication, transport and logistics, and other technologies. The Policy Statement also makes it clear to the offshore industry that the Government is committed to the provision of port facilities in Ireland for ORE developments. </p>  <p>  The Policy Statement also set out that a Ports Co-ordination Group would be established, the overall objective of which is to ensure that ports develop infrastructure to facilitate the ORE sector in line with Government Policy and foster the growth of the related supply chain. The Group will provide a forum for port related ORE facilitation issues to be raised and to promote the sharing of information and best practices in relation to ORE facilitation issues. The first meeting of the Port Coordination group was held on 31 March 2021 where it was agreed that the group would meet on a quarterly basis.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from Councils' own resources supplemented by State road grants, where applicable. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  The major cuts to funding for regional and local roads during the post 2008 recession resulted in the build-up of a substantial backlog of works across the country.  The estimated cost of the backlog is in excess of &euro;5 billion. </p>  <p>  Because of the pressures on the regional and local road network, approximately 90% of available Exchequer grant assistance to local authorities for regional and local roads is being directed to maintenance and renewal works rather than for new roads or for road realignments.</p>  <p>  While funding is not at a level that would allow the backlog of roadworks across the country to be addressed, there has been significant increases in Exchequer grants for regional and local roads particularly in the recent years. The 2022 allocation for regional and local roads is &euro;597 million approximately - &euro;46m Current and &euro;551m Capital. This represents an increase of about 46% compared to 2017.</p>  <p>  As regards the basis for allocating grants, within the available budget, the Department's grant funding for the maintenance of regional and local roads is allocated on as fair and equitable a basis as possible to eligible local authorities. In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of the road network within a local authority's area of responsibility with some account taken of traffic. It is envisaged that grants will continue to be made available on that basis.</p>  <p>  Basing regional and local roads grant allocations on road conditions could result in an uneven distribution of Exchequer funding. For example, local authorities that allocate higher levels of own resources funding to regional and local roads will have a larger proportion of roads with a higher condition rating than those with lower levels of own resources funding. Basing allocations on road condition could therefore disincentivise local authorities from allocating own resources funding to roads maintenance.</p>  <p>  My Department and I appreciate that, within the overall parameters set for the grant programme, local authorities might need to target funding at particular problem areas and there is sufficient flexibility in the structure of the grant programme to allow for this. It is also open to each local authority to allocate its own resources to priority areas.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that Exchequer funding for regional and local roads is intended to supplement realistic contributions from local authorities&rsquo; own resources. As the statutory road authorities for their areas, it is open to local authorities to reprioritise investment towards regional and local roads.</p></reply>

These are far from normal circumstances. </p>  <p>  Ukrainians arriving here under the Temporary Protection Directive have temporary residence status and cannot, as residents in Ireland, drive using their national licences. As Ireland has no licence exchange agreement with Ukraine and no mechanism to recognise Ukrainian licences, Ukrainians who wish to drive here would have to obtain an Irish licence through the normal process.</p>  <p>  To address this, on 22 April my colleague Minister Ryan signed an order to allow Ukrainians temporarily resident here, because of the conflict in Ukraine, to exchange their Ukrainian licences for Irish licences. Such licences are valid for 12 months and will only apply to cars. </p>  <p>  My officials are also engaged, at EU level, in discussions to develop a Europe-wide response to this issue. In addition, they are examining national options to allow an immediate response for situations involving the Temporary Protection Directive.</p>  <p>  The insurance sector has indicated that it is taking a pragmatic approach and my officials have been advised that Ukrainian car insurance, accompanied by a valid green card, will be recognised. However, the issue of whether a company will insure a particular driver is a matter between those parties, in which I have no function. Ukrainian drivers should engage directly with insurance companies or brokers when they are seeking motor insurance. </p></reply>

I have established a daily crisis management meeting between the Department and daa to monitor the situation.</p>  <p>  The company has undertaken significant work to address and mitigate the security queue times at Dublin Airport. It has put in place a number of measures including stepping up recruitment efforts; redeployment of staff where possible; establishing a senior management taskforce; opening security lanes on a 24/7 basis and enhancing communications with passengers. These measures are having a positive impact on passenger queue times at the airport. This positive impact was seen over the Easter weekend, even as passenger numbers reached around 200,000 departing passengers between Good Friday and Easter Monday. The vast majority of passengers went through security in under 40 minutes, and no passenger missed their flight as a result of security delays.</p>  <p>  On 19 April daa published revised advice for passengers following consistently improved queuing times over the last few weeks, including over Easter weekend. Passengers are now advised to arrive at the airport up to 2.5 hours before the departure of short-haul flights to Europe and the UK. The recommendation for long-haul passengers remains up to 3.5 hours.</p>  <p>  While recruitment remains ongoing, over 100 new security staff have been recruited recently and this should assist in the alleviation of the excessive queue times over the coming period.  These security staff are being deployed following the necessary training.</p>  <p>  Dublin Airport is planning for a significant increase in passenger volumes over the coming months.   It does note that this increase will present a considerable challenge. Management is reviewing the experience of the last number of weeks to further develop and refine measures to cater for the increased passenger numbers. I will continue to monitor the situation over the coming days and weeks and continue to engage with daa to ensure the positive impacts seen recently are maintained for passengers using Dublin Airport.</p></reply>

A number of ports, both large ones for construction and deployment and smaller ports for operations and maintenance activities, will be required to provide facilities for the different activities at several locations around the country and for the various phases of the fixed and floating ORE developments. </p>  <p>  This will also maximise the economic benefits at both regional and national level in terms of job creation and new SME enterprises in areas such as engineering, fabrication, transport and logistics, and other technologies.</p>  <p>  As part of endeavours to maximise EU funding, following extensive engagement with other Member States and the Commission, the Department successfully obtained changes to the Ten-T CEF criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE in the next 2021-2023 funding stream. Successful applicants can obtain significant funding of up to 50% of eligible costs for studies and up 30% of infrastructure works costs.</p>  <p>  The most recent call which closed on 19th January makes &euro;4bn funding available EU wide for transport infrastructure projects. Similar calls are expected in 2022 and 2023.  These are competitive processes, and typically oversubscribed.  Bearing in mind the confidential nature of the process, individual applications cannot be commented on. However, four ports/private entities that are eligible under TEN-T applied this year for funding for studies which will effectively allow them to prepare for lodgement of planning applications from 2022 onwards for ORE port developments. It is expected that a decision on the applications will be made in July this year.</p>  <p>  The Department assisted, as appropriate, eligible applicants with the application process. It is important for the State that preparatory work is advanced and planning applications submitted so that the entities will be ready to go to construction, once they have more certainty from developers that have come through the ORESS auction.</p>  <p>  In line with the ORE Ports Policy Statement, in March 2022, the department established a Ports Co-ordination Group to ensure alignment of policy and to monitor its implementation.  The overall objective of the Group is to ensure that ports develop infrastructure to facilitate the ORE sector in line with Government Policy and foster the growth of the related supply chain. The Group will provide a forum for port related ORE facilitation issues to be raised and to promote the sharing of information and best practices in relation to ORE facilitation issues.</p>  <p>  Members of the group include representatives of the ports and terminal operators, officials from the Departments of Transport, Environment, Climate and Communications, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and the IMDO.  The terms of reference also provide that the Group, where appropriate, can invite other agencies, Departments or stakeholders (industry developers, turbine manufacturers, other ports) to attend meetings and present to the Group.  </p>  <p>  The first meeting of the Port Coordination group was held on 31 March 2021.  Officials from the three participating Departments provided updates in relation to their respective policy matters. Ports and terminal operators identified issues which were relevant to them and there was discussion on the preparation of a Roadmap which will set out the ports&rsquo; role in supporting the development of the ORE sector in Ireland.  The next meeting will take place in Q2, the date of which has yet to be arranged and further meetings will take place quarterly. </p>  <p>  The Department continues to encourage engagement between the ports and developers so they are best placed to exploit the opportunities that will arise from the development of the ORE industry.</p></reply>

Excise duty was reduced by 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent per litre of diesel. These reductions are in place until 31 August 2022 and should help to reduce the operating costs of non-electric SPSVs.</p>  <p>  The maximum fares that may be charged by the driver of a taxi in respect of a journey undertaken in the State are established by the National Transport Authority by way of Maximum Fare Orders made under section 24 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2013. There is no role for the Minister in this process. </p>  <p>  The current applicable order is the Taxi Regulation (Maximum Fares) Order 2017, which took effect on 1 February 2018, and I can confirm to the Deputy that the NTA&rsquo;s work on reviewing the maximum fares established under this order is well underway.  The objective of the Maximum Fare Review is to determine whether changes need to be made to the current level of maximum fares in response to market changes facing the taxi industry, as well as changes in annual taxi operating costs.  Fuel costs are a major contributor in considering any such fare increases. </p>  <p>  The NTA has confirmed that it is endeavouring to conclude the review process as quickly as possible in 2022, whilst still ensuring that all steps, including a consultation process, are appropriately completed.</p></reply>

Despite significant price increases in the wholesale market over the last 12 months, ESB has not increased its prices since it introduced pay for use on the public charging network in October 2019. Up until then the public charging network was free to use for the previous 10 years.  </p>  <p>  From 5th May there will be an increase on transactions across all their payment plans when you charge your electric vehicle (EV) using the ESB public charging network in Ireland. Charging in Northern Ireland will continue to be free to use in the short term while ESB eCars continue their comprehensive network upgrade programme.</p>  <p>  80% of all EV charging is done at home. For a sample return journey from Galway to Dublin (400km) most EV owners, if charging at home, would only require a small top up charge of 60km from ESB eCars fast chargers. Even with 100% charging from a fast charger,  ESB eCars estimated that using a PAYG plan the cost would be &euro;26.67. This compares to a diesel car cost of &euro;37.34 for the same trip. </p>  <p>  As can be seen from the example above, the overall fuel cost of travelling with an EV remains much lower when compared with an ICE equivalent, and even more so when home charging is the main charging source. As such, while an increase in price, this is not expected to impact unduly on the transition to electric vehicles.</p></reply>

It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the YAC will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in this area, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the possible  timeframe for the inclusion of commercial bus operators in the scheme, to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years, to facilitate the expansion of EVs in the Irish car fleet. A draft National Charging Infrastructure Strategy has been published for public consultation which sets out a pathway for the provision of charging infrastructure to stay ahead of demand.</p>  <p>  The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include multi-unit dwellings. This scheme will be launched shortly.</p>  <p>  The Infrastructure Strategy proposes that for those who cannot charge at home, provision of residential charging solutions that give the same benefits and mirror the home charging option should be the first objective.</p>  <p>  There is an onus on national and local government to facilitate the provision of these charging solutions for citizens who do not have access to a home charge point.</p>  <p>  The Strategy proposes a new Residential charging scheme that will replace the existing Public Points scheme. It is envisaged that this new scheme will provide significant co-funding of 75% to Local Authorities to support the design of local area charging networks, as well as the delivery and installation of these networks which are intended to comprise both on-street charging in areas where residents do not have access to home charging solutions, and destination charge points. </p>  <p>  To coordinate the provision of EV supports and grants and the delivery of charging infrastructure, the Government will establish an office of Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI) within the Department of Transport in Summer 2022. ZEVI will coordinate and support the development and roll-out of publicly accessible charging infrastructure. ZEVI will therefore provide co-funding to support Local Authorities in developing local area network plans for EV infrastructure. I anticipate that the Residential Charging Scheme will be open to applications for funding  later this year.</p></reply>

The research noted that all of the safest European countries, except the UK,  require motorists to carry a warning triangle, and only Norway require them to carry a high-visibility vest. None of these countries require any further safety equipment.</p>  <p>  A number of legal issues were identified as part of the feasibility study, including the creation of an offence for either not carrying the equipment, or not using it when needed, and difficulties in enforcing the carrying of safety equipment.   There were also issues around whether the owner or the driver (or both) of a vehicle would be committing an offence if a vehicle did not carry the required safety equipment.  Further concerns were raised around the standard of equipment which motorists would purchase if minimum standards were not laid down in legislation, which in turn could lead to further enforcement difficulties.</p>  <p>  For these reasons it was agreed that while it is a good idea for vehicles to carry basic safety equipment, it was not feasible to set it down in legislation. However, notwithstanding this, the RSA&rsquo;s Car Safety Checks leaflet available at www.rsa.ie/docs/default-source/road-safety/r1.4-car-drivers/rsa-12-car-safety-checks.pdf?sfvrsn=83c94cea_3, strongly recommends that motorists carry an emergency kit consisting of a high viz vest, torch, red triangle, de-icing equipment and first aid kit.</p></reply>

Through bye-laws, these local authorities set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations. It is under Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001 that local authorities are provided with power in respect of making bye-laws.  Local Government legislation comes within the ambit of my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>  <p>  In most counties, there seems to have been little demand and bye-laws are not in place. In other areas, the matter is more relevant.  For example, in Kerry, where there is a long tradition of jarvey operation, bye-laws have been adopted to regulate the operation of these horse-drawn hackney carriages. </p>  <p>  Unlike other local authorities in the country, Dublin City Council lacks the power to regulate and set standards for horse-drawn carriages.  My Department is working with relevant stakeholders in developing an appropriate regulatory framework for this area. This work includes the consideration of how best to safely repeal the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55, which currently vests the power to regulate horse-drawn carriages in Dublin with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, to whom An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the successor.  Work on this issue, unfortunately, did not progress as planned in the last two years due to the need to prioritise work in other areas as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Work is once again progressing, however, and it is expected that, once consultations with relevant stakeholders have been completed, approval of Government will be sought to commence detailed drafting of the necessary legislation.</p></reply>

The format of licences, categories of vehicles and the standards to be met in driving tests to qualify for a licence are all set at EU level.</p>  <p>  Ireland may make bilateral licence exchange agreements with non-EU countries. These agreements can be made when the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction have studied and compared the two licensing regimes and each side is satisfied that they are compatible. For Ireland, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).</p>  <p>  The RSA has previously explored exchange agreements with the USA.

This would require the development of 50 separate agreements.</p>  <p>  When people come to Ireland with a non-exchangeable licence, they may obtain an Irish licence through the normal process.

The 2022 regional and local road grants were notified to local authorities on the 15<sup>th</sup>February and Monaghan County Council has been allocated a total of &euro;15,868,600 million which compares to an allocation of &euro;7,684,950 million in 2017.</p><p>The Department's grant funding for the maintenance of regional and local roads is allocated to local authorities on a pro-rata basis, determined mainly by the length of the regional and local road network in the county. Basing regional and local roads grant allocations on road condition could result in an uneven distribution of Exchequer funding. For example, local authorities that allocate higher levels of own resources funding to regional and local roads will have a larger proportion of roads with a higher condition rating than those with lower levels of own resources funding. </p><p>The Department appreciates that, within the overall parameters set for the grant programme, local authorities might need to target funding at particular problem areas and there is sufficient flexibility in the structure of the grant programme to allow for this. It is also open to each local authority to allocate its own resources to priority areas.</p></reply>

To accord with EU State Aid rules, grant levels under the Scheme are calculated as a percentage of the difference in price between a conventionally-fueled diesel HDV and its alternatively-fueled equivalent. Maximum grant levels for eligible vehicles depend on the size of the enterprise applying for the grant.</p>  <p>  &euro;3m was allocated to this scheme in 2021 and given the excellent response to the initiative, my Department has allocated an additional &euro;3m in funds this year to assist the heavy-duty vehicle sector in its transition to zero-mobility.

Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years. </p>  <p>  An Implementation Group has been established to progress the recommendations and consider further potential measures and barriers to the adoption of the EVs. It will also examine the creation of a second hand market. This Group will report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year.  </p>  <p>  In addition, work is underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland as a matter of priority. This office will co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure.  Our objective is to develop and refine cost-effective, targeted policy supports over the coming years.</p></reply>

This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p><p>Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p><p>There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as neighbourhood or residential charging, destination charging, and motorway charging. </p><p>The Department is working closely with a number of key stakeholders, including Local Government, to ensure electric vehicle charging infrastructure stays ahead of demand. This includes developing appropriate guidance for local authorities in line with the Programme for Government which will ensure we can continue to expand our national charging network through the supports for on street chargers.</p><p>Information about the development of the EV charging strategy in the Dublin local authority areas is available here councilmeetings.dublincity.ie/mgConvert2PDF.aspx?ID=33248</p><p>I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at www.lgma.ie/en/publications/general-publications/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf </p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles -  Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades. </p><p>The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and has announced through the strategy a number of additional actions to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the de-carbonisation effort.</p><p>My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.  <b></b></p><p>While the public consultation regarding the charging infrastructure strategy is ongoing, my Department continues to engage directly with stakeholders to ensure that a sufficient number of chargers, as well as a sufficient spread of charger types, will be in place to meet demand as we move towards our 2030 target of circa 1 million EVs on the road. </p></reply>

This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 55,000 now.</p>  <p>  My Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. The EVPP Working Group comprised senior officials and considered regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to help drive a significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales. </p>  <p>  Scrappage schemes were discussed as part of these considerations. The Working Group considered the potential of this incentive but concluded that a general  scrappage scheme would entail significant additional costs. That said, the Group concluded that niche markets scrappage schemes could potentially play an important role, such as in the SPSV sector. A scrappage scheme was introduced for the SPSV sector in 2021. </p>  <p>  A cross-departmental Implementation Committee has been established to progress the recommendations contained in the EVPP report and is due to report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year.</p></reply>

This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well assists in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home. This means that the majority of EV users will never need to access the public network except for longer journeys.</p>  <p>  A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p>  <p>  There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as non-residential neighbourhood charging, destination charging, and motorway charging. </p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles -  Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project including the rollout of charge points in each county can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades. While the ESB network information is available, there are a number of private charge point operators with sites already live in Ireland. One of the expected tasks of ZEVI will be to collate information about the various networks available to the public and offer a central source of information to EV owners.</p>  <p>  The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. My Department has reviewed the Scheme and has announced through the draft Infrastructure Strategy a number of additional actions to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the de-carbonisation effort.</p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

The decision was informed by a detailed appraisal and business case prepared by KPMG for the Department of Transport. The business case presented to Government set out the strategic case for a new service. It considered the range of options for how such a service could be delivered, including the potential for the Air Corps to provide an element of the service as a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; option alongside another civil operator. It also set out an implementation plan to achieve the desired service. The detailed appraisal included a financial and economic appraisal of short-listed options, with an assessment of costs, benefits, affordability, deliverability, risks and sensitivities associated with the options. The approval of the business case was one of the key steps required in the Public Spending Code (PSC).</p>  <p>  Provision has been made in the procurement documentation to allow the Air Corps to undertake the fixed wing element of the new service at some point during the contract term. Discussions with Department of Defence are ongoing in relation to this aspect.</p>  <p>  The procurement process is being conducted in accordance with &lsquo;Competitive Procedure with Negotiation&rsquo; (CPN) under the European Union (Award of Public Authority Contracts) Regulation 2016 (S.I. 284 of 2016). The first stage of the process &ndash; Prequalification - is reaching a conclusion and Candidates will be notified of the outcome in the coming weeks.  Shortly thereafter, Stage 2 of the procurement process will commence, when a Request for Tenders (RFT) will issue to those Candidates, which, at Prequalification Stage of the Competition, were determined to have the technical capability, and economic and financial standing to perform the contract. </p>  <p>  I would envisage publication of the business case will occur at the appropriate juncture in line with the Public Spending Code. However, at this stage the business case is an integral part of the procurement process and cannot be published at this time as it contains information which is commercially sensitive or could prejudice the outcome of the procurement process.  This is a requirement to ensure all tender competitions are competitive.  Making the Business Case, or associated financial analysis, available at this time could jeopardise not only the integrity of the process but tie our evaluators&rsquo; hands in striking the best deal possible for the Coast Guard and the taxpayer. There is a risk that even at a private hearing of Oireachtas Committees, discussions could breach EU principles on transparency, by virtue of the fact that the Department could be perceived to be influenced in its approach to particular tenderers by public representatives' representations. </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy may wish to be aware that my Department has already published a significant amount of non-financial and/or non-commercially sensitive material which collectively provides a clear and comprehensive outline of the project, including the strategic rationale, options considered and the recommended procurement strategy. This information is available on the project website (www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/ed653-irish-coast-guard-search-and-rescue-sar-aviation-project/ ), including a &ldquo;Information Note on Business Case and Government Decision July 2021&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy has stated, my Department has appointed an independent external Process Auditor and has been working with the Process Auditor since December 2019. I understand he will shortly submit a review of the process to date to the Secretary-General of my Department, which would encapsulate progress on the project since its commencement, up to and including the Prequalification stage referenced above. My Department intends to publish that review letter from the process auditor on the project webpage once it is available next month.</p></reply>

A number of ports, both large ports for deployment and smaller ports for operations and maintenance activities, will be required to provide facilities for different activities at several locations around the country, with various timelines for the phases of fixed and floating ORE developments.</p>  <p>  This will also maximise the economic benefits at both regional and national level in terms of job creation and new SME enterprises in areas such as engineering, fabrication, transport and logistics, and other technologies. </p>  <p>  In addition to their important role in maritime transport,  both Rosslare and Waterford ports see significant opportunities given their geographical location to service a range of windfarms off the south and east coasts, as acknowledged in the ORE Port Policy Statement.</p>  <p>  Rosslare Europort and Irish Rail are progressing plans for the development of largescale facilities at the port for the development of ORE and anticipate that they will lodge a planning application in 2023.  In this context, the port hosted an ORE stakeholder forum last Friday, 22 April 2022, in association with Waterford Port and the South East local and regional entities. The Department of Transport will continue to work with Rosslare Port as it progresses its plans for port infrastructure for serving the ORE sector while it also provides the necessary infrastructure to maintain RoRo freight activity at the port. Waterford Port has expressed support for Rosslare as a deployment base for ORE and is interested in the provision of operations and maintenance services facilities.</p>  <p>  Both Rosslare Europort and Port of Waterford are  &lsquo;comprehensive&rsquo; ports within the TEN-T Regulation at a European level which means that they are eligible to apply for European Connecting Europe Facility funding for relevant/eligible projects and the CEF 2021-2023 funding criteria allows EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE. </p>  <p>The most recent call which closed on 19th   January makes &euro;4bn funding available EU wide for transport infrastructure projects. Similar calls are expected in 2022 and 2023.  Due to the confidential nature of the process, individual applications cannot be commented on. However, I can confirm that four ports or private entities within ports that are eligible under TEN-T applied this year for funding for studies which will effectively allow them to prepare for lodgment of planning applications for their ORE port developments. Successful TEN-T applicants can obtain significant funding of up to 50% of eligible costs for studies and up 30% of infrastructure works costs.  It is expected that a decision on the applications will be made in July this year.</p>  <p>  The Department assisted, as appropriate, eligible applicants with the application process. It is important for the State that preparatory work is advanced and planning applications submitted so that the entities will be ready to go to construction, once they have more certainty from developers that have come through the ORESS auction.</p></reply>

This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, a comprehensive suite of measures is available to EV drivers, including purchase grants for private car owners and taxi drivers, VRT relief, reduced tolls, home charger grants, favourable motor and BIK tax rates, as well as a comprehensive charging network. These measures have collectively contributed to increased take up of EVs in Ireland in recent years, albeit from a low base, to over 55,000 now.</p><p>In addition, the Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. In particular, the group examined the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies. The recommendations of the EVPP Working Group were approved by Government and the full report is available online. In line with the Group&rsquo;s recommendations to support the transition to EVs:</p> <blockquote> 	The generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland has been retained until at least end-2022. Work is ongoing to identify additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles. Overall, cost-effective, targeted policy supports will continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years; and<br /><br />Work is underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland, as a matter of priority, to co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure.   </blockquote>  <p>A cross-departmental Implementation Committee has now been established to progress the recommendations contained in the EVPP report and is due to report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year. </p><p>One of the possible actions recommended for consideration by the EVPP working group was whether interest-free loans might be introduced to as part of a wider suite of incentives to promote the uptake of EV ownership, the newly established implementation committee will therefore give further consideration to this action.</p><p>Overall, the Department is acutely aware that the cost of electric vehicles remains an issue for many consumers. To this end, electric vehicle policy is kept under continuous review to endeavour to make low emission vehicles affordable.</p></reply>

Indeed, many commercial bus services similarly offered this assistance in getting people to a safe location.  </p>  <p>  I was also delighted to announce the provision of emergency public transport services to those refugees housed in rural or isolated locations to ensure better access to our local communities. This will be achieved through an acceleration of network improvements identified through the Connecting Ireland public consultation, including additional stops, route modifications, and more services with the aim to increase connectivity. Areas such as the Ring of Kerry will avail of such improvements, in practice catering for both existing demands as well as responding to the increased pressures on services where the local population has grown in response to the humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  Additional bus services will also be deployed to cater for those housed away from the existing public transport network. For instance, the NTA is looking at options to provide transport from the Earl of Desmond - where many refugees have been accommodated - to Tralee town. Such measures will provide better access to a range of amenities, employment opportunities and to onward public transport connections to larger centres.</p>  <p>  A Community Transport Fund is also being established to support occasional social travel requests. This will be operated by the TFI Local Link offices and will enable our Ukrainian guests to join in the many activities that are available in our towns, in particular, activities focused on youth, integration, culture, and education.</p>  <p>  Collectively, these endeavours aim to provide a means of greater integration between local and Ukrainian communities.</p></reply>

Anticipated demographic growth will lead to increases in these areas. As a result, transport is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise. Nonetheless, immediate action is necessary and I am confident that we will achieve our targeted reduction by 2030.</p>  <p>  In recent months, my Department has advanced a variety important policy initiatives which will make a significant impact - notably a new Sustainable Mobility Policy, a new Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Strategy, the National Transport Investment Framework, a Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement and a 5 Cities Demand Management Study and associated toolkit. Later this year, we will be publishing a 10 year Haulage Strategy which will inter alia, consider the long term decarbonisation options for this sector</p>  <p>  In terms of investment, through the NTA, we are advancing work on rural public transport (Connecting Ireland), Bus Connects and Active Travel programmes which will seek to promote modal shift to more sustainable transport, along the continued electrification of the public transport fleet and expansion of DART services. My Department is also considering how we can refine current commitments in order to deliver additional emissions reductions in a fair and equitable manner over the next 8 years.</p>  <p>  Reducing car dependency and implementing a radical shift towards sustainable mobility is the ultimate goal. As investments and projects in transport often materialise over the medium-term, my Department is taking action now that will pay dividends in future years.</p></reply>

The plan heavily invests in public transport and active travel to support Ireland&rsquo;s climate change obligations to achieve a 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Some of the major projects include: </p>  <p>  -  500,000 extra daily walking, cycling and public transport journeys will be delivered by 2030, making it easier for people to travel in a sustainable way. &euro;360 million a year will support up to circa 1,000 km of new and improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025, as well as additional investment in greenways &ndash; the largest ever investment in active travel infrastructure. </p>  <p>  -  BusConnects will be substantially delivered in all five cities across the country, massively expanding access to public transport and radically improving cycling infrastructure. On rural and regional bus services, around &euro;350m will be invested in renewing and expanding fleets across the country. </p>  <p>  -  Increased investment in the inter-urban and regional rail network will improve journey times, enhance reliability and maintain safety across the system. MetroLink and Dart+ in Dublin will be progressed to construction. </p>  <p>  -  Complementing public transport infrastructure investment, Connecting Ireland will deliver a dynamic approach to public transport in rural and regional areas, expanding local bus services and connecting rural communities with their key towns and regional growth centres. </p>  <p>  -  The NDP commits to a renewal of the road network (100,000 km), major urban and regional roads projects will be progressed to delivery including the M50 Traffic Control Project and bypasses of Moycullen and Listowel. Other important projects will be progressed including the N20/M20 corridor. It is targeted that almost 1 million electric cars, supported by additional infrastructure, will be travelling on our roads by 2030.</p>  <p>  These capital investments in our transport infrastructure will have a transformative effect on how we travel, supporting increased usability for the public and making substantial gains in our mission to combat climate change over the course of this decade.</p>  <p>  Further details on the NDP's transport commitments can be found at www.gov.ie/en/publication/774e2-national-development-plan-2021-2030/.</p></reply>

It has been estimated that approximately &euro;360 million was received between 2020 and 2021 under a number of these supports by Irish airlines and airports. The ISIF Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund has also been utilised by a number of our aviation stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The Government allocated &euro;161 million in aviation specific supports in 2021 to Irish airports. This included &euro;116 million allocated under an EU State Aid approved COVID-19 Supplementary Support Scheme. This funding has compensated our regional airports at Donegal, Ireland West and Kerry for the damage caused to them by COVID-19 as well as having provided our State Airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork with the flexibility to roll out route and other incentives, in consultation with airlines, supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.</p>  <p>  Both the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025 and COVID-19 Regional State Airports Programme 2021 provided &euro;45 million in 2021, benefiting Ireland West, Kerry, Donegal, Cork, and Shannon Airports.</p>  <p>  Ireland West, Kerry, and Donegal Airports were eligible under the Regional Airports Programme in 2021 and have remained eligible in 2022. By virtue of their size and passenger numbers, Shannon and Cork Airports have never, before now, been eligible for funding under this Programme. However, due to suppressed passenger numbers in 2020 and 2021, as a direct result of COVID-19, both airports have become eligible for funding under the Programme in 2022.</p>  <p>  On 19 April, &euro;16.4 million in Exchequer funding was announced under the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025. Almost &euro;6.6 million has been allocated to our regional airports at Ireland West, Kerry, and Donegal and over &euro;9.8 million has been allocated to our regional State airports at Shannon and Cork. Airports eligible for funding under this Programme will also be eligible to apply for operational grant-aid, from a budget of &euro;22 million, later this year.</p>  <p>  Government has maintained a strong commitment to the aviation sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, and through the provision of cross-economy and bespoke supports, it is well-positioned for recovery.</p></reply>

The Climate Action Plan 2021 sets out the concrete actions to deliver on the overall objective of reducing transport emissions by 2030 in line with both our national and these international obligations. </p><p>The actions focus on four key areas:</p><p>-  Sustainable Mobility &ndash; helping people choose sustainable options and delivering500,000 additional daily public transport andactive travel journeys - a 14% increase.</p><p>-  Electrification &ndash; accelerating the pace of Electric Vehicle (EV) take-up, almost 1 million EVs in the privatetransport fleet by 2030.  Increasing public transport, including railand bus electrification, to reduce reliance on fossil fuelled transport.</p><p>-  Demand management &ndash; introducing measures at national, regional and local level tomanage travel demand more efficiently and reducing the remaining fossilfuelled car kms by approximately 10%.</p><p>-  Increased biofuels mix - increasing the proportion of biofuels to a 20% blend fordiesel and 10% for petrol, to reduce emissions from the existing fleet.</p><p>-  The revised National Development Plan (NDP) also aligns transport investment plans with climate objectives and has dedicated &euro;1bn towards decarbonisation of transport in the period out to 2030.  This funding will assist the transport sector to reduce its carbon emissions and to transform our communities into healthier places to live.  Funding is being prioritised to encourage a shift from private cars to active and public transport options and to encourage greater take-up of EVs over the next ten years.</p><p>-  In December 2021, my department published the National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland (NIFTI) which sets out four strategic priorities for investment in land transport, one of which is decarbonisation. Future transport investment projects will have to demonstrate their fit with NIFTI, the National Planning Framework and National Strategic Outcomes.</p><p>-  In addition, the National Sustainable Mobility Policy was published in March 2022. It sets out a strategic framework to 2030 for active travel and public transport to support Ireland&rsquo;s overall requirement to achieve a 51% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of this decade.  </p><p>-  In support of EV adoption, a draft National EV Charging Infrastructure Strategy was published on March 31, 2022, which seeks to prioritise the delivery of fast and rapid charge point infrastructure over the next three years. The Strategy makes several recommendations in relation to the actions, funding streams and supports that will be put in place by Government to deliver a seamless publicly accessible charging network.</p><p>-  International Aviation Emissions are not included in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement and measures to mitigate emissions in that sector are taken at EU and ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) level. ICAO&rsquo;s &lsquo;basket of measures&rsquo; aims to reduce emissions through Market-based Measures, Operational Improvements, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Improved Aircraft Technology. Several of the EU&rsquo;s Fit for 55 proposals aim to reduce aviation emissions. These include, inter alia, the ReFuelEU Initiative which will mandate fuel suppliers to blend increasing amounts of SAF with kerosene between 2025 and 2050 and the Revision of the ETS for Aviation which aims to abolish the free allowances currently granted to airlines and integrate, as appropriate, CORSIA, ICAO&rsquo;s global aviation emission offsetting scheme with the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).</p><p>-  When taken together, these plans, along with a wide range of Government supports, will enable the transport sector to meet its international obligations on climate change.</p></reply>

Since 2010, increasing volumes of biofuels have been introduced to the Irish conventional fuel mix through a biofuel blending obligation on fuel suppliers. </p><p>The obligation ensures that a certain percentage of the motor fuel placed on the market comes from renewable sources, for example bioethanol and biodiesel. In 2020 alone, 239 million litres of biofuels replaced about 209 million litres of fossil fuels, avoiding approximately 520 KtCO2eq. GHG emissions.</p><p>Biofuels will remain a core transitional measure for medium-term reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in road transport. This is particularly so for hard to abate sectors such as heavy-duty vehicles, where alternative transport energy and technology are at early and varying stages of development. </p><p>I published the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement in November 2021. The Statement sets out a roadmap for the supply and use of renewable energy in transport to address Ireland&rsquo;s national commitments under the Climate Action Plan 2021 and European obligations under the Renewable Energy Directive.</p><p>The Policy Statement addresses a number of objectives. The Policy sets out an indicative trajectory for the annual increase in biofuel blending in transport fuel supply in Ireland to meet the climate action plan 2021 targets for 2030. It also provides measures to incentivise greater supply and use of advanced and development fuels in transport. The Policy also aims to ensure the highest standards of sustainability with regard to biofuels supply. To support the future development of the Policy, my Department is this year carrying out a study concerning the sustainability and availability of bio- and renewable fuels supply and demand in transport.</p><p>The Renewable Fuel for Transport Policy is currently subject to public consultation. The consultation follows a stakeholder engagement earlier this year comprising of a series of targeted themed stakeholder workshops and webinar. The written phase of the consultation commenced on 8 April and will run for a period of 6 weeks until 20 May 2022. A written report on the outcome of the consultation is expected by the end of June.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-26a.1068.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600078#WRU03500"><p>The European and Global oil markets are currently volatile, due to the conflict in Ukraine exacerbating pre-existing market shortages, primarily of diesel. This has caused a spike in the price of crude and in the price of refined products on the retail market.</p>  <p>  On 15 March 2022, Minister Ryan and I proposed to Government an emergency support measure &ndash; the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme. The Scheme will provide support of &euro;100 per week for eight weeks for each eligible heavy goods vehicle (HGV) authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. I can confirm that the scheme is available only to operators holding a road haulage operator licence.</p>  <p>  In deciding on a targeted scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for some own account operators also, in addition fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead costs for licensed hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Emergency Scheme however, the Government has provided for an excise duty reduction on mineral oil taxes with effect from 10 March. This saw a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction on auto diesel,  proposed to last until 31 August 2022. On 11 April the Government extended the period of the reduced excise rates out to Budget Day. This measure is a benefit to all citizens and business to mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases.</p>  <p>  In general, however, it should be noted that the causes of these fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. Unfortunately, we must accept that it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases. </p>  <p>  In addition, we must continue the progress we have made to date on the implementation of climate policies which are critical to ensuring we reduce emissions and mitigate climate change.</p>  <p>  In light of these last two factors, it is important that haulage and other businesses now engage with their customers on the need for the prices for their products and services to reflect the increasing costs.</p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measures, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases.</p></reply>

However, in its recommendations, the Commission concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer of the child only. A feature of the One-Parent Family Tax Credit was that it could be claimed by multiple individuals in respect of the same child, resulting in an unsustainable position.</p><p>The One-Parent Family Tax Credit was replaced with the Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit (SPCCC) from 1 January 2014. The current value of the credit is &euro;1,650 per annum. In addition to the credit, a qualifying claimant is entitled to an additional &euro;4,000 on the standard rate income tax band. </p><p>However, the credit is more strategically targeted, in that it will in the first instance only be available to the principal carer of the child, who has a qualifying child resident with him or her for the whole or greater part of the tax year and who satisfies the other conditions of the relief. To qualify as a single person for the purposes of the SPCCC, the claimant must not be jointly assessed for income tax as a married person or civil partner, or be living with his or her spouse or civil partner. An individual can only receive one SPCCC irrespective of the number of qualifying children residing with him or her. </p><p>If both parents have equal custody (by court order) and the child resides with each parent for an equal part of the tax year, the primary claimant is the parent who is in receipt of Child Benefit from the Department of Social Protection. However, it should be noted that this &lsquo;tie-breaker&rsquo; test is only relevant for the purposes of determining a primary claimant for this credit in the unusual situation where the child resides with each parent for an equal amount of time. </p><p>A primary claimant can relinquish entitlement to the SPCCC to a secondary claimant. The secondary claimant can then claim the credit if he or she qualifies as a single person and the qualifying child resides with him or her for at least 100 days throughout the tax year. Detailed information on the SPCCC can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website at link: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-41.pdf which may be of interest to the Deputy.</p><p>I am satisfied that the SPCCC in its current form is targeting limited State resources to where they are most needed. As such, I have no plans to reinstate a system such as the One Parent Family Tax Credit. </p><p>To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, the number of taxpayers claiming the SPCCC for the years 2014 &ndash; 2018 (the latest year for which data are currently available) is set out below: <table>    <tr>       <th>2014</th>       <th>2015</th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>71,100</td>       <td>66,800</td>       <td>65,700</td>       <td>67,400</td>       <td>70,500</td>    </tr> </table> This data be found by consulting Revenue's 'Costs of tax expenditures' publication available at www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/tax-expenditures/costs-expenditures.aspx</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that there are no data on its records to indicate the number of taxpayers sharing custody of a child or children and therefore it is not possible to quantify the potential cost of making the SPCCC available to both parents in these circumstances.  </p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that the cost to the Exchequer of increasing the standard rate band for SPCCC claimants to &euro;45,800, to be in line with that of a one earner married/civil partnership taxpayer unit, is estimated at &euro;16m.</p></reply>

I am advised by Revenue that the provisional amounts raised through the Carbon Tax in 2021 and to the end of March 2022 are &euro;652 million and &euro;197 million respectively.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 forecast that the increase in the Carbon Tax rate from &euro;33.50 to &euro;41.00 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted (from Budget night for auto fuels and from 1 May 2022 for all other fuels) would yield &euro;109 million in the first year and &euro;148 million in a full year. The rate change effective from 12 October 2021 has contributed around &euro;19 million of the &euro;197 million collected to end March 2022.</p>  <p>Given the high uncertainty surrounding the price of motor fuels and the impact this may have on consumption, it is not possible to determine, with a high level of certainty the revenue that the carbon tax increase in October may yield in 2022.  Based on the most recent available data from October 2021 to December 2021 the &euro;7.50 increase in carbon tax applied on the 13th   October accounted for an additional &euro;17.7m in carbon tax and an estimated &euro;1.7m in VAT . Of which &euro;12m was collected in 2021 with the remaining been collected in January 2022.</p>  <p>  A decision was taken in Budget 2020 to ring-fence any additional revenues raised by the increase in carbon tax to be used to protect those most vulnerable to higher fuel and energy costs, to support a just transition for displaced workers and to invest in new climate action.</p>  <p>  Following this, the Programme for Government committed to hypothecating all the additional carbon tax receipts over the 2021-2030 period (estimated at &euro;9.5bn), with &euro;3bn to be allocated to targeted social welfare and other initiatives to ensure a Just Transition, &euro;5 billion to be allocated to energy efficiency, and the remaining &euro;1.5bn to be allocated to green agricultural measures.</p>  <p>  In 2022, the revenue available for investment is &euro;412m. This is comprised of the revenue made available in 2021 (&euro;148m) and 2020 (&euro;90m) and the allocation of an additional &euro;174m to meet the Programme for Government commitment to spend &euro;9.5bn by 2030.</p>  <p>  Out of the &euro;740m of additional carbon tax receipts that has been allocated since the hypothecation process began in Budget 2020, approximately 47% (&euro;348m) has been allocated to energy efficiency measures, which includes Energy Poverty Efficiency Upgrades and the 2020 Aggregated Housing Upgrade Scheme. Approximately 36% (&euro;264m) has been allocated to targeted social welfare supports, including the fuel allowance.</p>  <p>  Allocations of &euro;15m (2%) were made to peatlands rehabilitation and &euro;18m (2%) was allocated to a Just Transition Fund to support impacted communities. A further &euro;27m (4%) has been allocated to Greenway and Urban Cycling programmes over the 3 years, while &euro;24m (3%) and &euro;9m (1%) have been allocated for grants for Electric Vehicle purchase and Electric Charging infrastructure respectively.</p>  <p>  In addition, &euro;29m (4%) has been allocated to green agricultural pilot schemes and &euro;6m (1%) was allocated to an Overseas Development Aid Green Climate Fund, which provides financial support to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries and to help vulnerable societies adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government contains commitments to: </p><p>- Review the policy framework within which credit unions operate;  </p><p>- Enable and support the credit union movement to grow;  </p><p>- Support credit unions in the expansion of services, to encourage community development; </p><p>- Enable the credit union movement to grow as a key provider of community banking in the country.</p><p><b>Review of the Policy Framework</b></p><p>With regard to fulfilling the commitments in the Programme for Government for credit unions, the Review of the Policy Framework has been completed following a recent engagement session with all the credit union representative bodies. The proposals arising from the Review received broad support from the representative bodies and will go to Cabinet shortly for approval to draft legislation.  The proposals being considered aim to better position credit unions to grow as a key provider of community banking.</p><p>In developing these proposals Minister of State Sean Fleming TD has met the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers Association, the National Supervisors Forum, the Registrar of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, the CEO Forum, collaborative ventures and many individual credit unions. In total, Minister of State Fleming has held over 40 stakeholder meetings with the credit union sector and well over 100 proposals were considered.  </p><p>I will refer specifically to the creation of a regulatory and legislative credit union policy committee. Both the Department of Finance and the Central Bank already have a very substantial programme of engagement with the representative bodies. One example of this is the Credit Union stakeholder roundtable chaired by the Department, which facilitates dialogue between all the representative bodies, the Central Bank and the Department.  The proposals will seek to support engagement between credit unions, the Department and the Central Bank, whilst respecting the Central Bank&rsquo;s independence.  </p><p>The proposal to establish a business model taskforce is not being progressed as there is no legislative barrier for credit unions to create such a taskforce at present. It would also not be appropriate for Government to have a role in setting the business model for credit unions, which are owned by their members.  </p><p>In terms of supporting the sector to provide essential financial services to local communities, the following are some recent developments which highlight the potential of the sector to grow and fulfil a role in relation to community banking.  </p><p><b>Lending and Investment</b></p><p>The Central Bank has in recent years reviewed both the lending and investment frameworks for credit unions. New lending regulations were introduced on 1 January 2020.</p><p>Credit unions can provide 7.5% of their assets to mortgage and SME lending - approximately &euro;1.5 billion.  Credit unions have the capacity to lend an additional &euro;1.1 billion in mortgage and SME loans. Further additional lending capacity is available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank.</p><p>As of December 2021, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;408 million, an increase of 19% year-on-year.  </p><p>Credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). Three credit union backed funds have received approval from the Central Bank. Credit unions will be able to invest up to &euro;900 million in these regulated funds, which will subsequently lend to AHBs. </p><p><b>SME Lending </b></p><p>Nineteen credit unions were approved in early 2021 for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Further, in November 2021 five credit unions were announced as participants in the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme (BILS). </p><p>In total, SME lending has grown 9.5% year on year to end December 2021.  Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book. </p><p><b>Other Services</b></p><p>Other than member savings and lending, in order to provide &ldquo;additional services&rdquo;, a credit union must receive approval from the Central Bank.  </p><p>69 credit unions are approved to provide current accounts.  </p><p>The Central Bank has prescribed a list of exempt services which may be provided without requiring approval. The Central Bank is undertaking a review of the Exempt Services Schedule to ensure that the services listed reflect the current financial services landscape. The Central Bank has commenced a public consultation seeking views from stakeholders on the proposed changes arising from this review.</p></reply>

There is no discretion under the Directive for Ireland to reduce the rate of VAT on these goods.</p>  <p>  Farmers may elect to register for VAT or be treated as flat-rate farmers for VAT purposes. Farmers that are registered for VAT have an entitlement to reclaim VAT charged on costs incurred in relation to the farm business, including VAT borne on the purchase of agricultural equipment such as slurry equipment.</p>  <p>  Farmers who are not registered for VAT are entitled to avail of the Flat-Rate Farmers Scheme which compensates them for the VAT incurred on goods and services used in the course of their farming business by allowing them to charge a flat rate addition for their supplies of agricultural produce and services. This long-standing arrangement is provided for under Ireland&rsquo;s VAT legislation and is permitted under the Directive.</p></reply>

No. 60/1993 does not give any specific weighting to the presence of an individual in the State on any specific days of the month or year. I am informed that while Revenue does not &lsquo;deem&rsquo; a presence in the State over a specific period in this context, a person wishing to avail of the exemption under SI. No. 60/1993 has the onus of proof. To fulfil this, the person must provide satisfactory evidence that they are eligible for an exemption from Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT), and as such would be required to demonstrate they are normally resident outside the State.</p>  <p>  In a circumstance where a person was in the State on certain dates and is not able to demonstrate that they departed the State between these times, Revenue is required to conclude that those days have been spent in the State. This is because the person concerned has not fulfilled the requirement to demonstrate their presence outside the State, a necessity for the exemption to be applied.</p>  <p>  Revenue states in its guidance on VRT that an exemption should be refused where there is insufficient, satisfactory documentary evidence to support an application. As such, in the absence of proof that the qualifying criteria have been fulfilled, such an application would not qualify for an exemption.</p></reply>

This was initially planned for 14 months, from 1 November 2020 to 31 December 2021. This was then extended to 31 August 2022 in recognition of the difficulties facing these sectors.</p><p>This extension provides support for a further 8 months to the end of the 2022 summer season, allowing for a longer period of recovery for tourism and hospitality. This measure is only one of the supports the Government has provided for businesses over the course of the pandemic and was always designed to be temporary, with a sunset clause included in the enacting legislation.</p><p>A review was undertaken of the 9% VAT rate in advance of Budget 2019. This review found that tourism expenditure is more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than price changes, which reduces the relevance of the VAT rate applying to the sector.</p><p>Should the economic position or tourism demand alter, the VAT rate applicable to tourism will be reviewed as part of the budgetary cycle.</p></reply>

MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is proportionate to the carbon dioxide emissions of the fuel concerned and is commonly referred to as carbon tax. The non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. </p><p>The Deputies will be aware that the 2020 Programme for Government committed to increasing the amount that is charged per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions from fuels to &euro;100 by 2030. I followed through on this commitment by introducing legislation in Finance Act 2020 to provide for a 10-year trajectory for carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of carbon dioxide by 2030. This measure is a key pillar underpinning the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. Carbon tax increases are scheduled to apply to petrol and diesel on Budget night and on all other mineral oils on 1 May each year to 2030.</p><p>Diesel used for certain purposes, for example in agricultural machinery, may qualify for a reduced rate of MOT. Such diesel must be marked with prescribed fiscal markers and is referred to as Marked Gas Oil (MGO), green diesel or farm/agricultural diesel. The current reduced rate of MOT that applies to MGO is &euro;120.55 per 1,000 litres. This is considerably less than the standard rate of MOT on diesel used as a propellant which is currently &euro;405.38 per 1,000 litres.</p><p>In March this year, in response to the global fuel crisis, I introduced cuts to MOT rates on petrol, diesel and MGO. I intend to introduce a further cut to the MOT rate on MGO from 1 May to run until 11 October this year.  This rate cut will be applied to the non-carbon component of MOT to fully compensate for a scheduled increase in the carbon component. The rate of MOT on MGO will be almost 30% lower from 1 May than the rate that would have applied had I not provided for relevant cuts. As a result of the measures I introduced, all MGO users will benefit from a cut of more than 5 cents per litre inclusive of VAT from 1 May until 11 October. The table below provides the current MOT rate, broken into its carbon and non-carbon components, along with the pre-cut rate and the rate to apply when the temporary reduction period ends.  <table>    <tr>       <th>MOT   rate on MGO from</th>       <th>MOT   non-carbon</th>       <th>MOT   carbon</th>       <th>Total   MOT</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01-May-21</td>       <td>&euro;47.36</td>       <td>&euro;90.81</td>       <td>&euro;138.17</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>10-Mar-22</td>       <td>&euro;29.74</td>       <td>&euro;90.81</td>       <td>&euro;120.55</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01-May-22</td>       <td>&euro;0.00</td>       <td>&euro;111.14</td>       <td>&euro;111.14</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12-Oct-22</td>       <td>&euro;47.36</td>       <td>&euro;111.14</td>       <td>&euro;158.50</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition to benefiting from the enhanced, reduced MOT rate on MGO (farm/green diesel), farmers and agricultural/forestry contractors may also claim a tax deduction for expenditure incurred on MGO (including any MOT charged) in computing their taxable profits. In computing their taxable farming profits, farmers may also benefit from a relief provided under Section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This relief allows a farmer to claim an additional deduction for MGO which amounts to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline). </p><p>The relief under section 664A is available to any person carrying on a trade of farming in the State. Agricultural/forestry contractors are not entitled to this relief as they are not carrying on a trade of farming which, as defined in section 654 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, requires the occupation of farmland. However, as outlined above, such contractors may claim tax deduction for expenditure incurred on fuel costs when calculating their taxable profits.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning that MOT law provides for a relief from the carbon component of MOT for biofuels that are made of biomass of animal or vegetal origin. This means that a fuel that is entirely made from biomass would be liable for the non-carbon component of MOT only. In the case of such a biofuel used in place of MGO, the MOT carbon component would be fully relieved. For blended fuels containing biomass, the relief applies to the portion of fuel that meets the biofuel criteria set out in MOT legislation. The biofuel relief is intended to promote a higher level of biofuel in fuel sales and supports Government&rsquo;s commitment to incentivising the use of greener alternatives to fossil fuels. </p><p>Finally, if the Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors wish to meet me or my officials they should submit a request to my private office.</p></reply>

The programme is usually undertaken by students in their second or penultimate year of study, and for most an internship is a requirement in order to complete their course. Placements are typically between 6-12 months in duration, commencing in September or January of any given year, depending on the course. The students participating in the Bank&rsquo;s Internship Programme are paid &euro;20,902 per annum, or a pro-rata sum thereof. </p>  <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council runs an annual Summer Internship Programme. The internships are temporary posts, each lasting up to 12 weeks over the Summer months and are open to those currently engaged in an undergraduate or postgraduate degree programme in Economics. The Programme accepts two interns annually, both of whom receive remuneration.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has, in previous years, facilitated paid placements for college students. In 2021, the NTMA accepted one intern for a period of six weeks. It is anticipated that further placements will be advertised on an annual basis. The NTMA assigns staff to Home Building Finance Ireland, the National Asset Management Agency and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, and can assign interns to these bodies as required. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General accepts fourteen students annually on temporary work placement as part of a co-operative education programme with the University of Limerick. These 8-month placements are a formal, integral, compulsory and academically accredited element of the students&rsquo; degree programmes. The interns are remunerated at Point 1 of the Clerical Officer Temporary PPC salary scale.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has operated an Internship Programme with a variety of colleges nationwide for a number of years. As of 2019, all interns assigned to Revenue have been placed on Point 1 of the Executive Officer salary scale for the duration of their internship. Revenue onboards interns to work across specialist fields such as Economic Research, Information and Communications Technology, and Audit and Compliance. Of the 18 interns due to take up their positions in 2022, 8 have already commenced their internship in Revenue, with the remaining 10 expected to commence throughout the year. Since 2019, the number of interns accepted annually by Revenue are: </p>  <p>  2019=12; </p>  <p>  2020=11; </p>  <p>  2021=7; and </p>  <p>  2022=18</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-26a.1164.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600080#WRW01400"><p>Ireland&rsquo;s taxation of fuel is governed by European Union law as set out in Directive 2003/96/EC, commonly known as the Energy Tax Directive (ETD). The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended) and this Act provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel, and kerosene, that are used as motor or heating fuels. </p><p>The Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS) was introduced in 2013 with the aim of providing support to road haulage and bus transport operators when the retail price of diesel is relatively high. The DRS operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby a partial rebate of MOT is available when the retail price of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 per litre excluding VAT. The repayment rate increases gradually as the retail price increases, up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre. </p><p>The DRS operates as a State Aid under Commission Regulation (EU) No 651/2014, commonly referred to as the General Block Exemption Regulation. The DRS allows qualifying operators to benefit from an effective lower rate of MOT than other diesel users. While this application of a differentiated MOT rate on diesel for certain commercial uses is allowed under Articles 7.2 and 7.3 of the ETD, the ETD minimum rate, currently &euro;330 per 1,000 litres, must still be complied with. This means that the effective MOT rate is what is considered in terms of compliance with ETD minimum. The effective MOT rate is determined by reducing the actual MOT rate by the maximum DRS repayment rate. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that a repayment under the DRS may only be made to licensed road haulage and bus transport operators who purchase diesel in the State for use in qualifying motor vehicles. Operators established in the State must hold either an international operator&rsquo;s licence or a national operator&rsquo;s licence issued under the Road Traffic and Transport Act 2006. In addition operators must provide proof of tax compliance; either a valid Tax Clearance Certificate issued by Revenue or written proof of tax compliance in the form of a letter from the tax authority of another Member State where the operator&rsquo;s road licence was issued. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in March this year, in response to the current fuel crisis, I introduced a significant reduction of 15 cents inclusive of VAT on MOT for diesel. I will shortly bring forward legislation to extend this rate cut until 11 October.  A further reduction of 1 cent per litre inclusive of VAT was applied from 1 April and this will also run until 11 October. </p><p>This means that the current rate of MOT, &euro;405.38 per 1,000 litres, is &euro;75.38 over the ETD minimum rate of &euro;330 per 1,000 litres. However, when the DRS is taken into account the effective MOT rate is only &euro;0.38 per 1,000 litres above the ETD minimum. It is for this reason that I have no scope under EU law to make any further material cuts to the MOT rate on diesel. Recent MOT rate changes are summarised in the table below, along with comparisons between actual and effective MOT rates and the ETD minimum rate. </p><p>The Government has also provided an &euro;18m package of emergency support measures for licenced hauliers to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices. This targeted and temporary grant scheme will provide a payment of &euro;100 per week for every heavy goods vehicle (over 3.5 tonnes) as listed on a road haulage operator&rsquo;s licence. The scheme will operate for a period of 8 weeks and will be reviewed thereafter. </p></reply>

The analysis conducted using the I3E model examines the effects of policy changes on a number of variables, against a &lsquo;Business as Usual' (BaU) scenario, where no such policy changes are introduced. As regards the price of carbon, it is important to bear in mind that the estimates within the model&rsquo;s projections are a function of the underlying assumptions for international energy prices, as well as the impact of any policy changes. The relevant papers examining the potential impact of increases in the carbon tax are available on the JRP website: www.esri.ie/current-research/joint-research-programme-on-the-macroeconomy-taxation-and-banking.</p>  <p>  The most recent analysis using the I3E model is a working paper entitled the &lsquo;Impacts of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Retrofitting on the Irish economy&rsquo; published by the ESRI in December 2021. In addition to modelling Government commitments in regard to uptake of electric vehicles and heat pumps, this working paper analysed the economic and environmental impacts of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to raise the carbon tax to &euro;100 per tonne by 2030 through graduated annual increases. The paper is available at</p>  <p>www.esri.ie/publications/the-impacts-of-electric-vehicles-uptake-and-heat-pump-installation-on-the-irish. </p>  <p>  Some of the findings of the most recent working paper were that, at the macroeconomic level, the effects of the carbon tax on activity would mean that GDP would be around 1.36 per cent lower by 2030, compared to the BaU scenario for 2030. However, with heat pump and electric vehicle adoption, this reduction is significantly abated to just a 0.2 per cent decline compared to the BaU scenario.</p>  <p>  Overall, the work published by the ESRI finds that the combined policies contribute to a fall in economy-wide emissions of 21.6 per cent, when compared to the BaU scenario.  Specifically, the carbon tax is responsible for a 15.9 per cent reduction in emissions, or 8.3 million tonnes of CO2, when compared to the BaU scenario. </p>  <p>  In addition to the analysis undertaken by the ESRI, through the JRP, my Department has currently published updated estimates of the impact of inflation on energy prices over the medium term as part of the recently published Stability Programme Update 2022. </p></reply>

NAMA has at all times operated within the statutory obligations set out in the NAMA Act, primarily to obtain the best achievable financial return from its acquired assets and to protect or otherwise enhance the value of those assets.</p>  <p>  Noting its obligations regarding debtor confidentiality, NAMA can respond only in general terms to the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding the criteria used for managing a debtor&rsquo;s debt. Any debt management by NAMA is a carefully considered process and is generally undertaken only when all secured assets have been sold with proceeds remitted towards debt repayment and all potential further avenues for recourse to the debtor have been exhausted.  Otherwise, holding residual debt indefinitely, with no remaining assets to realise, incurs an annual administrative cost to NAMA and ultimately the taxpayer. The Deputy will note that the write-off of outstanding debt does not typically represent a loss to NAMA. This is because potential losses were crystallised to the participating institutions when NAMA acquired the loans.</p></reply>

This concluded that the introduction of such a model into the State would have impacts not only on insurance premiums, but also potentially on taxation and social security, as well as having constitutional, national and European ramifications, such as on EU insurance directives. It is therefore difficult to envisage a no-fault system as it exists in New Zealand being applied in Ireland in view of our current legal and constitutional framework. The Deputy should also note that introducing a no-fault model could have fundamental cost implications in terms of raising revenue in the form of direct and indirect taxation.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles, nor can I direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.</p>  <p>  In order to be as helpful as possible, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland in relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query. Insurance Ireland indicated it is not aware of any specific difficulties for private companies securing insurance cover for company owned electronic vehicles, nor has is received any queries through its Insurance Information Service in relation to this matter. </p>  <p>  Broadly, Insurance Ireland advised that its members do offer cover for these types of vehicles, whether company  or individually owned and that in general the same standard acceptance criteria applies for electric vehicles as for fuel vehicles. However, Insurance Ireland noted that there can be differences between insurers, for example, whether such cover is only available through fleet insurance. I understand that this would be the same for all company cars, whether electrically or conventionally powered. </p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland highlights that different insurers can have different approaches to how this cover is offered for company owned vehicles and recommends that businesses should seek to get more than one quote. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), on its website, also recommends that consumers get quotes from a number of insurance companies, including their current one. I believe that this advice applies to businesses as well as individuals. </p>  <p>  Separately, work is continuing across Government to complete the Action Plan for Insurance Reform in order to improve the affordability and availability of cover for all groups, including motorists. Achievements to date include the creation of an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market. The aims of the Office include working to further competition in the Irish market in order to increase the availability of cover, both by encouraging existing insurers to expand their risk appetite, and exploring opportunities for new entrants. </p>  <p>  Finally, it may interest the Deputy to know that the free Insurance Information Service operated by Insurance Ireland is for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, and can be accessed at: feedback@insuranceireland.eu. In addition, Brokers Ireland can be contacted at insurancequeries@brokersireland.ie.</p></reply>

The timeframe for delivery on this commitment is the second quarter of 2022.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enabled Revenue to collect certain information in relation to the occupancy status of  residential properties including, where unoccupied, the duration and reason for this, in the Local Property Tax (LPT) return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-2025. This information, together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax.  </p>  <p>  Revenue have completed a preliminary analysis of the LPT returns received to date which has been shared with my Department. The results of the preliminary analysis suggest that levels of vacancy are low across all counties. I anticipate that further detail in relation to this analysis will be available in the coming weeks. I understand Revenue intends to publish a profile of the occupancy data from the LPT returns in due course.</p></reply>

Health care is defined as the &ldquo;prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability&rdquo;. Expenses incurred in relation to the maintenance or treatment of an individual in a nursing home will qualify for income tax relief. This is subject to the requirement that the nursing home is one which provides 24-hour on-site care.</p>  <p>  Income tax relief available under section 469 TCA 1997 is due to the individual(s) who incur the relevant expense and is granted by way of a deduction, equal to the expense defrayed, from the individual&rsquo;s total income. The amount of income on which that individual is subject to income tax is therefore reduced and the relief is provided at his or her &lsquo;marginal rate&rsquo; of tax, being either 40% or 20%. </p>  <p>  Where an individual receives financial support under the Fair Deal Scheme, such amounts are not eligible for relief. Financial support includes both the payment made by the Health Service Executive (HSE) following an application for support to assist a person in meeting the cost of care services, and money advanced by the HSE by way of loan. Any excess contributions made by the individual towards nursing home fees will however qualify for income tax relief in the usual manner.</p>  <p>  Further details in relation to income tax relief for nursing home fees are set out on the Revenue website and in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-12, both of which may be found at the links below:</p>  <p>  - Revenue website: www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/health-expenses/index.aspx</p>  <p>  - Tax and Duty Manual: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-12.pdf.</p>  <p>  Tax relief under section 469 TCA 1997 applies in respect of income tax only.  Therefore, it does not extend to Universal Social Charge, Local Property Tax (LPT) or any other taxes. </p>  <p>  The proposals raised in the details supplied by the Deputy to create a fund from which fair deal expenses up to the taxpayers marginal rate of tax might be reimbursed in circumstances where income tax relief cannot be fully absorbed, would amount to a form of a refundable tax credit.  Such proposals would raise broader policy and cost issues in respect of the income tax system which are significantly beyond the question of tax relief for health expenses. </p>  <p>  Overall, I am satisfied that income tax relief in respect of health expenses it in its current form is appropriately calibrated and there are no immediate plans to review or amend the relief.   </p>  <p>  However, in relation to LPT it is worth pointing out that properties vacated by their owners due to illness can be exempt from the charge. This exemption applies to a property which was occupied by a person as his or her sole or main residence and has been vacated by the person for 12 months or more due to long term mental or physical infirmity. An exemption may be available in situations where the property has been empty for less than 12 months, if a doctor is satisfied that the person is unlikely to return to the property. In both cases the LPT legislation currently stipulates that the exemption applies only where the property is not occupied by another person. However, the recently enacted Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021, modifies the above exemption so that from 2022 another person can occupy the property without the exemption being lost.</p></reply>

Under the Act lenders are obliged to submit specified personal and credit information in respect of qualifying credit applications and agreements to the CCR.  In the case of credit agreements this includes factual information such as, where applicable, details of payment performance, credit status, restructure events etc.</p>  <p>  The CCR assists lenders in their lending and credit management operations.  For example, it supports lenders when they carry out their creditworthiness assessments and provides factual information about the indebtedness profile of a borrower and their repayment performance on their individual loans.  However, the CCR does not produce credit scores or ratings and neither does it provide guidance or a recommendation to lenders on the decision they should make on an application for credit.  The decision on an application for credit, or in relation to the restructure of an existing loan, is a commercial matter for the relevant lender.  Neither I nor the Central Bank can become involved in the credit related decision making process of lenders.</p>  <p>  Borrowers may access their credit report free of charge (subject to fair usage) from the CCR.  If a person believes that the information on their credit report is inaccurate, incomplete or not up to-date, they have a right to have the information corrected.  Also, if so desired, a borrower is entitled to provide an explanatory statement about information on his/her credit report which can explain an event or circumstances about a person's loan or loans.  Further information about these matters can be obtained from the Central Credit Register website.</p></reply>

The VAT Directive obliges each Member State to have a standard rate of VAT and also allows that a Member State may choose to have no more than two reduced rates of VAT, which may be no less than 5%, and which may be applied to certain goods and services:  any of those listed in Annex III of the Directive. Within this framework, Ireland currently applies a standard rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%.</p>  <p>  The EU Directive permits derogations from the general rules to allow an individual Member State to continue certain historic tax treatments, such as the application of one of their reduced rates to particular goods and services which are not included in Annex III.  Ireland, in line with the VAT Directive and by way of special derogation from the general rule, maintains several &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; provisions and derogations that allow us to maintain reduced rates to certain supplies for historical reasons. It is on this basis that Ireland applied its 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to the supply of fuel, gas, oil, and electricity services for both domestic and commercial use. The current 13.5% VAT rate applied to energy products is a &lsquo;parked rate&rsquo;, and cannot be reduced below 12%.</p>  <p>  Following lengthy negotiations Annex III of the VAT Directive was expanded at the beginning of April to include gas and electricity. This means that Ireland can apply a reduced rate of 9% to these products. However it is not possible to apply a 9% rate of VAT to home heating oil as the reduced rate that applies to it is the result of a historical derogation. It should be noted that other Member States must apply their standard rate of VAT to this product.</p></reply>

This was in addition, to the ongoing and frequent contact between officials in my Department and their colleagues in Brussels and the European Commission across a wide range of issues, including taxation policy and how to respond to the energy crisis. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, following lengthy negotiations, amendments to the VAT Directive were provisionally agreed in December 2021 with final sign off on the amended text at ECOFIN in April 2022. This new agreement came into effect on 5 April 2022. </p>  <p>  Under this new agreement, Annex III of the VAT Directive was expanded to include gas and electricity. This means that Ireland can apply a reduced rate of 9% to these products in line with other goods and services to which a reduced rate applies. The Government has made a decision to avail of this flexibility from 1 May, the start of the next VAT period. </p>  <p>  In relation to VAT on home heating oil, this new agreement on VAT rates also preserved Ireland&rsquo;s historical derogations in relation to fuel and oil despite them not being included in Annex III. It is on this basis that Ireland applies its 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to the supply of fuel and oil for domestic and commercial use while other Member States must apply their standard rate of VAT to this product. The current 13.5% VAT rate applied to energy products is a &lsquo;parked rate&rsquo;, and cannot be reduced below 12%. </p>  <p>  If the Government were to reduce VAT on home heating oil to 12%, the saving would be very small, but there would be a considerable additional cost to the Exchequer (&euro;216m to the end of October). This is because, all other areas currently subject to the 13.5% rate to this level would also have to be reduced to 12% as  we are only allowed have two reduced VAT rates under EU law.  These account for about 25% of economic activity and, as well as fuel used for heat and light, also includes construction, housing, labour intensive services and general repairs and maintenance.  </p>  <p>  I and my officials have sought and will continue to seek the maximum degree of flexibility for Member States with respect to VAT as it applies to domestic energy and fuel use. That engagement will continue as I work with my European counterparts and the EU Commission to respond to the current energy crisis. </p></reply>

This is a key pillar underpinning the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan ambitions to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. The annual breakdown of these receipts was provided in reply to PQ No.78 of 10 November 2021.  Further details were provided to the Deputy in relation to this request in response to PQ No.172 of 18 November 2021 and PQ NO.68 of 24 November 2021 in relation to the methodology behind this calculation. </p>  <p>  As was previously noted, the projections for carbon tax receipts are based on a declining carbon tax base reflecting changing behaviour in response to the tax, amongst other factors. The projections were not based upon a 51 per cent reduction in emissions relative to 2018 levels. These estimates were based upon official projections from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published, in June 2021 which represented an independent assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions trajectory to 2030. Specifically the estimates are based on the EPA&rsquo;s non-ETS (EU Emissions Trading System) &lsquo;WAM&rsquo;, or with additional measures scenario for greenhouse gas emissions, which includes the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a &euro;100 per tonne carbon tax by 2030. Currently, the EPA has not published an alternative emissions scenario that incorporates carbon tax changes in the manner that the Deputy has requested. Therefore it is not possible to estimate the impact on carbon tax receipts in a similar manner to previous calculations. </p>  <p>  In relation to the rate of carbon tax, it is important to acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to the carbon tax 2030 trajectory and to note that revenues raised from the additional ring-fenced carbon tax revenues will be used to fund Just Transition measures. </p>  <p>  For context, it should also be noted that changes to carbon tax rates are having a relatively small impact in terms of the rising energy costs being experienced by households and firms. Indeed, it is clear that the carbon tax is not the cause of current energy price inflation. Nonetheless, the Government recognises the difficulties such rising costs can create and has therefore taken a range of measures, such as the &euro;200 electricity credit and reductions in fuel excise duties, to support household incomes. </p>  <p>  More broadly, over the medium to long term, the best way to protect the livelihood of citizens and our economic interests from the impact of international fossil fuel prices is to reduce our dependence on them. As set out in the CAP 2021, we will achieve this through the progressive decarbonisation of Irish society and through the steps that will be taken to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p></reply>

The first &euro;1,270 of total chargeable gains in respect of an individual in any year of assessment is exempt from CGT.</p>  <p>  It is the amount of the chargeable gain (if any) arising on the disposal of an asset which is subject to CGT.  In these circumstances, the chargeable gain is calculated as the difference between the proceeds received on the disposal of the property by way of CPO and the price paid for the property (or in certain circumstances, the market value at the time of acquisition). A deduction may be claimed for costs incurred in acquiring and disposing of the property such as for example stamp duty, legal fees, auctioneers&rsquo; fees.</p>  <p>  The disposal for CGT purposes will occur by reference to the date on which the compensation proceeds are received and any CGT liability arising will be payable by reference to that date. </p>  <p>  If, however, the property acquired by way of CPO was occupied by the owner as his or her principal private residence, then full or partial relief from CGT will be available where a chargeable gain arises on the disposal of that property.  </p>  <p>  Section 604 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides relief from CGT on the disposal of one&rsquo;s principal private residence. If an individual occupied the property as his or her principal private residence throughout their period of ownership, then full relief is available in respect of any gain which arises on the disposal of the property.  Where the property has been occupied by the individual as his or her principal private residence for part of the period of ownership, only a proportion of the gain on the disposal is exempt. The last 12 months of ownership of the property by the individual is treated as a period of occupation for the purpose of this relief. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the facts and circumstances of each disposal will determine the amount of any CGT due as a result of a property being compulsorily acquired.   </p></reply>

This represents a downward revision of close to -1.5 percentage points in 2022 and close to &frac12; a percentage point in 2023. This downward revision is a result of the squeeze on household real incomes and a softer investment outlook in the face of mounting inflationary pressure and heightened uncertainty. </p>  <p>  Of course, given continued geopolitical instability, the margin of uncertainty around these projections is significant, with the balance of risks firmly tilted to the downside. Any further escalation of the war or a protracted disruption to supply chains arising from it could have significant ramifications for global growth.

ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 which provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol and diesel, that are used as motor or heating fuels. MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component.

The incentive offers a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.</p>  <p>  For a property to qualify for HTB, it must be new or converted for use as a dwelling, having not been previously been used as a dwelling. In the circumstances where the house was previously used as a dwelling but knocked down and rebuilt, then it is considered &ldquo;new&rdquo;. First-time buyers may purchase a site containing a house which is derelict and which they plan to demolish, in whole or in part, with the intention of building a new house. First time buyers intending to undertake such purchases should contact Revenue via MyEnquiries outlining the specific circumstances of their case and Revenue will consider them on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific question about properties previously used as a residential home, the HTB scheme is designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. An increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current housing crisis and so remains a priority aim of Government policy. A move to include properties previously used as a residential home/second-hand properties within the scope of the relief would not improve its effectiveness; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question as to whether similar support is available to those first-time buyers who purchase a second-hand property, there is no a similar tax-based measure.  Such a scheme would be likely to have a significant deadweight element and a high Exchequer cost while providing no incentive effect for encouraging the building of new homes. </p>  <p>  Non tax-based supports are, primarily, a matter for the Minister for Housing , Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  Finally, and as the Deputy may be aware, I announced in my Budget 2022 address that a formal review of HTB will take place in 2022. The review will inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022. My Department is currently managing the tender process and I understand that a contract for the review exercise is likely to be awarded shortly. </p></reply>

This includes those who are working from home or working a pattern of working from home/in the work premises. </p><p>Flexi-time accrual arrangements were re-introduced from August 2020 in circumstances where employees are attending the employer&rsquo;s work premises for the full complement of their normal, pre-COVID work attendance patterns and rostered hours. </p><p>Remote working in the Civil Service, post COVID-19, will be facilitated on a blended basis.  In this context, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in consultation with employers across the Civil Service has developed a Blended Working Policy Framework for the Civil Service. The Framework was published on 31st March 2022 and has been distributed to all Civil Service organisations to allow for the development of their own blended working policies.  When completed, each Department/Office will roll out their blended working policies and implementation plans. </p><p>Flexitime accrual for civil servants availing of a blended working arrangement is to be tested by way of pilots. Officials in my Department have commenced working with Civil Service colleagues to discuss the details and implementation of the pilots, which will be conducted over the coming months. </p></reply>

It provides staff with opportunities to broaden their skills and continue their professional and personal development while retaining the right to return to their substantive or equivalent position in the sending organisation at the end of the secondment. It also provides an opportunity for the receiving organisation to fill a temporary position with both the receiving and sending organisations benefitting from shared learning, good practice, new ideas and experience.</p><p>Secondments between Civil Service organisations require sanction from my Department to fill a position through secondment prior to advertisement through the Public Appointments Service.  However Guidelines and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ&rsquo;s) which support the Secondment Policy - see link above - set out exceptions to this sanction approval requirement.  These typically include specialist skill placements or existing arrangements in place between organisations or within a sector (e.g. AGO, CSO, IGEES, CSSO, C&amp;amp;AG, various EU programmes, diplomatic missions abroad, arrangements between a parent department and a non-civil service body within its sector).</p><p>This Secondment Policy also provides that the same principles and guidance may be applied to secondment arrangements between a parent Department and a non-civil service body within its sector.</p><p>It is not a requirement for Public Service bodies, as distinct from Civil Service organisations, to seek sanction from my Department to fill a position through secondment. This is a matter between the Public Service body and its parent Department. </p></reply>

The first stage involves assessing the flood risk and identifying options, followed by planning, detailed design, construction and maintenance. Public consultation forms part of each stage and project websites, available on floodinfo.ie  provide updates on each scheme&rsquo;s progress.</p><p>The Dundalk/Blackrock South and Ardee projects, that are being progressed simultaneously, were chosen by Louth County Council as the first project to be advanced in Louth. The tender for Engineering and Environmental Consultancy Services was awarded in 2020 to a joint venture between Binnies (formerly Black and Veatch) and Nicholas O &lsquo;Dwyer.  The preliminary project cost estimate for these schemes is &euro;80m and the proposed scheme will protect some 1,880 properties when completed and the scheme option is expected in the first half of 2023.  </p><p>In relation to the Drogheda and Baltray schemes, the tender for Engineering and Environmental Consultancy Services was awarded to RPS Consulting Engineers Ltd in September 2021. The preliminary project cost estimate for these schemes is &euro;35m and the proposed scheme will protect some 450 properties when completed and the scheme option is expected at the end of 2023.  </p><p>The OPW are meeting Louth County Council over the coming weeks to discuss how the Carlingford and Greenore scheme should be progressed and to progress the Engineering and Environmental Consultancy Services tender brief. </p><p>The OPW, to ensure that the Council, as contracting authority has adequate resources to manage the design and construction of this scale of flood relief projects is funding five Council staff including, a Senior Executive Engineer, two Executive Engineers, an Administrative Officer and a Technician Grade 1. </p><p>Funding of just over &euro;1.9 million has been provided to Louth County Council across these major schemes since 2019 (see details below).</p><p><b>Funding to Louth County Council for Major Flood Relief Schemes 2019 to 2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;</td>       <td>&euro;</td>       <td>&euro;</td>       <td>&euro;</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dundalk &amp;amp; Ardee FRS</td>       <td>186,130</td>       <td>279,164</td>       <td>1,169,190</td>       <td>1,634,484</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Drogheda &amp;amp; Baltray FRS</td>       <td></td>       <td>81,808</td>       <td>159,130</td>       <td>240,938</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlingford &amp;amp; Greenore FRS</td>       <td></td>       <td>18,655</td>       <td>25,060</td>       <td>43,715</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td>1,919,137</td>    </tr> </table> As well as funding for major flood relief schemes, additional funding of &euro;1.6m has been approved for Louth County Council under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme since 2009.</p></reply>

Special Leave with Pay was introduced at the outset of the pandemic to assist in the prevention of the possible onward spread of COVID-19 in the work premises. Special Leave with Pay does not identify how or where an individual may have contracted Covid-19. The rehabilitation of employees is a matter for each individual sector. </p><p><b>Appendix A:</b></p><p>The Public Service Sick Leave Scheme provides for the payment of the following to staff during periods of absence from work due to illness or injury:</p><p>- A maximum of 92 days on full pay in a rolling one year period </p><p>- Followed by a maximum of 91 days on half pay in a rolling one year period </p><p>- Subject to a maximum of 183 days paid sick leave in a rolling four year period </p><p>- There is access to additional sick leave in certain circumstances as provided by the Critical Illness Protocol. </p></reply>

The purpose of a Higher Education Staffing Agreement, once finalised, will be to update the existing Employment Control Framework approach which has been in place since 2011 and which is still in place in a number of sectors in the public service. </p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that the Employment Control Framework for the Higher Education sector is updated on an annual basis having regard to the funding decisions made as part of the annual Estimates process and which is then operationalised by the Higher Education Authority across all Higher Education Institutions.  I would highlight that overall staffing in the sector, both core and non-core, has increased by approximately 4,500 or 18 percent since 2016. </p>  <p>  While the operation and management of the existing Employment Control Framework approach is a matter for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the individual Higher Education Institutions, key issues from my Department&rsquo;s perspective are to ensure that it appropriately reflects fiscal, expenditure and public service staffing and pay policies. </p>  <p>  Regarding the overarching principles for a new approach, my Department is seeking to ensure that staffing decisions taken in the higher education sector are affordable and sustainable both from a higher education perspective but also from an Exchequer and wider public service staffing and pensions perspective.  My Department is also mindful of the need to ensure that there is appropriate flexibility built in to any revised approach so that higher education institutions can operate efficiently in making their staffing decisions, having regard to their overall expenditure allocations and other appropriate controls. </p></reply>

It was about how we can enable greater accessibility, equality, diversity and inclusivity in the media; support environmental sustainability, and promote our language, our culture and our creativity.</p>  <p>  Given the wide ranging and far reaching recommendations which the Commission have addressed, it is only right that we give the report very careful and detailed consideration. The Commission's work must also be considered in the context of a range of other complex and inter-related issues in the media and wider digital space.</p>  <p>  Following further consideration by An Taoiseach, myself and other key Ministers, it is intended to bring the report to Government, after which it will be published.</p></reply>

Accordingly, programme material broadcast by UK broadcasters are subject to the rules set by the relevant national regulatory authority of the Member State where they hold their broadcasting licence. Article 9 of the Revised Audiovisual Media Service Directive sets out the minimum standards for commercial communications which must be adhered to by all Member States. Article 4 of the Revised Directive makes provision for a Member State to escalate non-compliance with its broadcasting codes with other regulators, in circumstances where it considers that a broadcaster regulated in one jurisdiction and targeting citizens in another jurisdiction is undermining local regulation.</p>  <p>  In January 2022, I published the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 which will dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and establish a new regulator, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, which will, inter alia, be responsible for overseeing updated regulations for broadcasting and video on-demand services established in the State, including issuing media services codes and rules applying to such services. The Bill will also transpose the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive into Irish law. Article 13(2) of that Directive gives Member States the option to levy the revenues of media service providers under their  jurisdiction or which are not under their jurisdiction, but that are targeting audiences in their territories, to fund the production of European works. Following a Regulatory Impact Assessment provision was made for a content production levy within the General Scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. Section 53 of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 (as published) provides for the imposition of a content production levy (termed the &lsquo;European works levy&rsquo;) on media service providers (i.e. providers of broadcasting and streaming services) to fund a scheme (termed &lsquo;the European works scheme&rsquo;) to support the production of European works, including Irish works.</p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in Our Rural Future, I launched the Transitional LEADER Programme which came into effect from 1 April 2021 and will run to the end of 2022. A total of &euro;70 million is being made available over this programming period. &euro;65 million of this budget is available to LAGs who deliver the programme and approve projects at local level.  This allocation covers both core project expenditure and the administration and animation costs of the LAGs. </p>  <p>  On 9 April last year, my Department released the individual LAG allocations for the transitional period. These enhanced allocations provided certainty to all LAGs and their Implementing Partners for profiling their administration, animation and project expenditure for 2021 and 2022. </p>  <p>  In situations where the LAGs administration and animation allocations are utilised, I approved additional funding in this area, subject to a maximum monthly contribution from the Exchequer, the limits of which were also notified to each LAG at that time.  This notification outlined the specific arrangements with regards to administration and animation Exchequer funding for LAGs. As these amounts notified are the maximum monthly contribution from the Exchequer, LAGs and their Implementing Partners were advised to review their administration and animation expenditure requirements so as to ensure that they are able to operate within their allocated budgets and to take corrective action in advance where required.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, should the Kildare LAG utilise all its administration and animation programme funding, my Department will be providing a maximum monthly contribution of &euro;24,359 from the Exchequer towards the administration and animation costs incurred. This contribution is based on the average monthly administration and animation allocation over the period July 2016 to December 2020 as outlined to the LAGs in April 2021. There is no provision for this level of funding to be increased.</p>  <p>  The process of finalising the arrangements for the new LEADER programme is ongoing in consultation with the EU Commission and stakeholders.  This process will include arrangements for the allocation of funding across LEADER areas under the new LEADER programme.  The draft CAP Strategic Plan includes an allocation of &euro;180m for the new LEADER programme for the period 2023-2027.  This brings the total allocation for the 2021-2027 period to &euro;250m, which maintains the LEADER allocation from the previous 2014-2020 programming period.</p></reply>

The HSF is a competitive grant scheme for conservation works to heritage structures in both private and public ownership. Grants of between &euro;15,000 and &euro;50,000 are available under Stream 1, and of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;200,000 under Stream 2. </p>  <p>  Applications are made in the first instance to the local authorities, who send a shortlist to my Department for assessment by an expert panel which makes its recommendations to me for final approval. Applications are assessed under a series of clearly-defined criteria, the details of which may be found in the HSF circular on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/32ae3-financial-assistance-for-architectural-heritage/</p>  <p>  Under HSF 2022, a total of 129 applications were received by my Department for assessment. While this year&rsquo;s fund of &euro;4m represents an increase of 33% on 2021, HSF2022 was heavily over-subscribed and it was unfortunately not possible to make awards to all applications that met the minimum assessment criteria. This includes the structures in question. </p>  <p>  While further consideration cannot be given to unsuccessful applications, officials in my Department can, at the request of the relevant local authority, provide feedback in respect of an individual application should the applicant wish to re-apply to the scheme again the following year. It is intended to run the HSF again in 2023 and details of the scheme will be made available this November.</p></reply>

The agency is currently recruiting staff to work on this project. The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is also presently scoping out the legislative provisions that will be required to underpin the new registration system with a view to these provisions being enacted in 2022.</p>  <p>  The final details of the operational arrangements in relation to the new registration system - including its linkages to the online short-term letting platforms - are still being worked out. However, an underlying objective of the new system will be to ensure that an adequate level of private rental accommodation can be provided, particularly in urban areas of high housing demand, and that such accommodation is not overly diverted to the short term letting sector at the expense of local people seeking long-term rental accommodation. </p></reply>

Dwellings under the scheme come from a number of different sources including private owners, Part V and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). </p>  <p>  AHBs are important partners for local authorities in the delivery of social housing. AHBs can lease properties from private property owners using a long term lease arrangement for a period from 10 to 25 years. This long term lease arrangement is negotiated between the AHB and the property owner and it is the AHB&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that the lease complies with the general leasing terms. </p>  <p>  There is no current option to purchase the leased property under long term lease arrangements, however, an option to purchase may have been included in some long term leases by local authorities in the early stages of the leasing programme. </p>  <p>  At end 2021, 1,006 AHB leased dwellings were supported under SHCEP with an average annual cost of &euro;10,110 per dwelling. This data refers to AHB long term leases and does not include CALF funded projects.</p>  <p>  Rental Availability Agreements (RAAs) otherwise known as Rental Accommodation Scheme/ RAS type agreements are funded under SHCEP and are agreements between property owners and local authorities to secure medium to long-term availability of accommodation over a period of time (1-10 years). RAAs are not available to AHBs.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) allows tenants of AHBs in receipt of rent supplement and residing in CAS funded properties to transfer to RAS. The local authority enters into a contract with the AHB to make the property available to RAS for an agreed term at an agreed monthly rent. This is a contractual arrangement, rather than a lease agreement.</p></reply>

Local authorities are required to evaluate that any social housing project, including those by AHBs, reflect housing need, that the properties comply with regulatory requirements and that the objectives of creating and maintaining sustainable communities are met.</p>  <p>  In recent years, the main source of funding to AHBs for social housing delivery is through borrowings and support from local authorities through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) and Payment and Availability (P&amp;A) programme. AHBs enter into a P&amp;A agreement with the local authority and make the relevant properties available for social housing.  </p>  <p>  Applications for P&amp;A-CALF funding are made by AHBs directly to my Department, following a consultation with the local authority. The application to my Department normally consists of a completed application form and a financial model for the capital cost, income and operational costs projected over the P&amp;A term.</p>  <p>  As with all Exchequer-supported projects, my Department as sanctioning authority assesses each project proposal for suitability as determined by the local authority, value for money and compliance with the various requirements of the funding programme. On the financial aspects of a CALF application, the Housing Agency undertakes an independent assessment to analyse the capital costs, projected income and projected expenditure against a standard set of assumptions agreed with the Department. The appropriate level of CALF is determined by reference to a projected minimum Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR). Debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) is a measurement of the cash flow available to pay current debt obligations. </p>  <p>  Detailed approval, payment and performance monitoring arrangements are in place across all Departmental funding arrangements, including those supporting AHB activity. Following approval, letters of sanction include detailed terms and conditions relating to payments, and onward payments to AHBs are issued to the local authority and Approved Housing Body. In the case of CALF and P&amp;A supported projects, once approved, the local authority then enters into two agreements with the AHB, as follows: </p>  <p>  - The P&amp;A Agreement that will cover the conditions under which the properties will be made available for the term of the agreement; and </p>  <p>  - A Capital Advance Agreement (CAA) that stipulates the terms and conditions on which the money is being made available from the State and also stipulates the repayment      conditions.</p>  <p>  All payments are made to AHBs by local authorities and my Department recoups these costs to local authorities.</p>  <p>  Accelerated CALF payments may also be approved by the Department for projects including turnkey developments. The accelerated CALF can be applied to facilitate site purchases or stage payments to a developer, deposits for properties under construction or for sale and to facilitate the acquisition of homes requiring works. In such cases, the milestones may vary depending on the requirements of the project and will be set out by my Department in its approval letter. The local authority will seek an acknowledgement of the associated risk along with details on any mitigation measures to be taken by the AHB. </p>  <p>  Social housing construction projects funded by my Department for local authorities under the Social Housing Investment Programme and for AHBs under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), must like all publicly-funded construction projects, comply with the Government&rsquo;s Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF), the objectives of which are to ensure greater cost certainty, better value for money and financial accountability. To ensure alignment with the CWMF, these projects progress through a four stage approval process as part of the broader pre-construction process undertaken by the local authority.  The four stages are:</p>  <p>  Stage 1 &ndash; Capital Appraisal submission to establish the business case;</p>  <p>  Stage 2 &ndash; Pre-planning submission and cost check;</p>  <p>  Stage 3 &ndash; Pre-tender approval and cost check;</p>  <p>  Stage 4 &ndash; Tender approval.</p>  <p>  My Department and local authorities also operate a single-stage approval process for construction projects up to &euro;6m in value, while Design and Build approaches are also used which can save time in relation to design, procurement and construction. The majority of local authority public housing projects are developed using public works contracts.</p>  <p>  Local authorities also acquire social housing through a turnkey arrangement with developers through funding under the Social Housing Investment Programme. The Department&rsquo;s approval procedure for turnkeys is generally a single stage evaluation and approval with submissions being made by way of a Capital Appraisal. Unlike the public works contract for a CWMF construction project, a turnkey contract can be a simple &lsquo;Contract of Sale&rsquo;. However, there are general procurement principles which apply and, in particular, the local authorities must comply with obligations for transparency and equal treatment, as well as clarifying for my Department&lsquo;s assessment and approval, that the turnkey proposal meets housing need, is suitable in terms of typology and sustainable community principles, is compliant with regulatory requirements and represents value for money.</p>  <p>  I have recently published a new Design Manual for Quality Housing and also a Review of Pre-Construction Processes undertaken in cooperation with the local authority and AHB sectors. These recent initiatives are important in the work to improve the quality, cost-effectiveness and pace of delivery of social homes.</p></reply>

Following the completion of the AA/SEA processes, the Draft SCSGs will be placed on display for a focused period of public consultation. It is envisaged that this will happen in mid-2022. Submissions made during the public consultation period will be reviewed and where appropriate and necessary, amendments will be made to the published Draft. Thereafter, the draft guidelines will be submitted to the Minister for approval. The final Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended).  </p>  <p>  The Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS), was jointly launched by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government in 2013. DMURS sets out design measures and standards for urban roads and in order to support and encourage more sustainable travel patterns and to put well designed streets at the heart of sustainable communities. The manual is mandatory for urban roads and streets within the 60 km/h urban speed limit zone (with some limited exceptions). The proposed Sustainable &amp;amp; Compact Settlement Guidelines, will be concerned with the delivery of compact and sustainable forms of urban development more generally.  However, due to the interrelated nature of the guidance the DMURS guidance will be reflected in the updated Sustainable &amp;amp; Compact Settlement Guidelines.</p></reply>

It commits to an examination of defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing&rsquo;s report &quot;Safe as Houses?&quot;. Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates this commitment.</p><p>In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings take place to advance elements of the work.</p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  The full terms of reference of the Working Group are to:</p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>- Identification and description of defect,</p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected,</p><p>- Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>- Location of dwellings affected.</p><p>3. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.</p><p>4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.</p><p>- In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.</p><p>5. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.</p><p>6. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>7. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>8. Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>As part of its deliberations, the working group is consulting with a wide range of relevant stakeholders.  As part of this stakeholder engagement, the Working Group conducted a series of online surveys between 31 January and 14 March 2022 seeking the experiences of homeowners, landlords, Directors of Owners&rsquo; Management Companies and Property Management Agents. These submissions are currently being analysed.</p><p>The insights gained through engagement with stakeholders as well as the outcome of the online consultation are informing the ongoing deliberations of the Working Group and are supporting the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and finalisation of its report.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Working Group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter, and will require sufficient time to complete its work. In that context, I look forward to a report later this year following completion of their consultations and deliberations. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p></reply>

Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 75,000 homes have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;184 million under the scheme.</p>  <p>  In response to the Programme for Government commitment, my Department launched a newly revised ten year Energy Efficiency Programme in 2021 for local authority owned housing. This new programme set a BER performance requirement of &ldquo;B2&rdquo; or cost optimal level. The upscaling of the works included in the programme sees a substantial overall increase in the funding made available for insulation, windows and doors and the installation of a Heat Pump and all associated works. The installation of gas/oil boilers or solid fuel or inset stoves are not financially supported by my Department under the energy efficiency programme. This does not however preclude local authorities from funding the provision of such heating systems from their own resources.</p>  <p>  In 2022, the EERP will see a significant increase in funding to &euro;85 million, allowing approximately 2,400 homes nationally to be upgraded to a B2 or cost optimal equivalent (BER).

Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates these commitments.</p>  <p>  I brought a Memorandum to Government on an enhanced Defective Concrete Blocks Grant Scheme on 30 November 2021. It included an unprecedented suite of improvements to the current scheme. The required primary legislation to give effect to the enhanced scheme will include a provision for the Minister to introduce a scheme of grant assistance for local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to remediate social homes in their ownership which have been impacted by defective concrete blocks.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the statutory framework for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board and for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme. The provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material. AHBs are eligible to apply to the Pyrite Remediation Scheme. Section 3 of the Scheme outlines the eligibility criteria applicable to all applicants. A total of 3 AHBs have participated in the Scheme to date and 60 dwellings owned by AHBs have been included in the Scheme with a further 18 currently at stages 1 and 2 (validation and verification stages).</p>  <p>  Finally, a Working Group to examine defects in housing has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings take place to advance elements of the work. The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.</p>  <p>  As part of its deliberations, the working group is consulting with a wide range of relevant stakeholders, including the AHB sector.  As part of this stakeholder engagement, the Working Group conducted a series of online surveys between 31 January and 14 March 2022 seeking the experiences of homeowners, landlords, Directors of Owners&rsquo; Management Companies and Property Management Agents. These submissions are currently being analysed.</p>  <p>  The insights gained through engagement with stakeholders as well as the outcome of the online consultation are informing the ongoing deliberations of the Working Group and are supporting the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and finalisation of its report.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Working Group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter, and will require sufficient time to complete its work. In that context, I look forward to a report later this year following completion of their consultations and deliberations. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p></reply>

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) recently published its Annual Report for 2021 on Public Sector Energy Efficiency Performance. The report notes that my Department has exceeded the baseline target of a 30% energy reduction. We currently stand at an energy savings of 39.6% and are on the glide path to meet the 50% target by 2030 as set out in the Climate Action Plan. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department renewed its ISO 14001:2015 Standard Accreditation on 02 Sept 2021. This accreditation certifies both the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s Environmental Management Systems and also, that they are in compliance with international best practice. Furthermore, we are the first Government Department to achieve this accreditation on a multi-site basis. Officials in my Department work closely with colleagues in the OPW on an ongoing basis, to reduce energy usage in all Departmental locations. Some specific measures undertaken by my Department to reduce its energy usage include:</p>  <p>  - The installation of new energy efficient heat pumps in the Custom House, Dublin. </p>  <p>  - The retrofitting of lights in the Car Park of our Wexford offices with energy efficient LED bulbs.</p>  <p>  - Working with the OPW on a programme to swap out old internal light fixtures with new energy efficient, motion activated bulbs throughout all main office locations.</p>  <p>  - Significant roof insulation works were carried out in our Ballina offices in 2021. These works have improved the offices Building Energy Rating (BER) from C1 to B2. Light fixtures throughout the building were also replaced with energy efficient bulbs during this project. </p>  <p>  - My Department commissioned feasibility studies regarding the installation of Solar Panels in our main office locations. Based on the recommendations of those studies, we are proceeding with the installation of solar panels in our Ballina Offices. Officials in my Department are working with the OPW regarding tendering for these works. After installation, which is planned for Q3 2022, it is envisaged that the Ballina Office, which is over 30 years old, will upgrade its BER to A2. It is estimated that the Solar Panels will cater for 24.3% of onsite electricity requirements.</p>  <p>  - My Department has implemented a One Device Policy which has moved away from issuing desktops as the standard ICT equipment to now issuing laptops, which has significantly reduced power consumption.</p></reply>

The creation of this Town Centre First (TCF) policy is an objective of the Programme for Government and it was published on 4th February 2022. The policy was jointly developed by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development and it supports established national policy objectives in the National Planning Framework, Housing for All and Our Rural Future. Town Centre First sets out 33 specific actions which provide a co-ordinated framework to address the decline in the health of our towns and sets out actions to regenerate and revitalise them. All these actions have either implicit targets related to delivering better outputs and outcomes for the development of town centres or explicit output unit targets where relevant. </p>  <p>  Addressing vacancy and maximising the use of existing housing stock is a primary objective of the Government and there are number of measures provided for in the Town Centre First policy which support commitments in the Housing for All strategy to address vacancy and dereliction. In particular, the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund under Action 26 will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of both serviced sites for housing, to attract people to build their own homes and also to support the refurbishment of vacant and derelict properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages, in a sustainable way. The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund aims to facilitate the making available of some 2,000 sites for homes by 2025 and a pathfinder programme is currently under consideration and it is expected that a call for proposals will issue to the local authorities shortly. </p></reply>

Most of the funding from Central Government to local authorities must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into 5 broad programme categories: housing, transport, recreational, education and environment. </p>  <p>  My Department has a wide and diverse business agenda, covering a broad range of functions, including local authority housing, voluntary housing, homeless services, estate regeneration, energy efficiency retrofitting, housing grants, rural water schemes, urban renewal/regeneration, and fire services.   In order to achieve its business objectives, my Department allocates significant resources to an extensive range of organisations, including local authorities, dedicated agencies, and other bodies; some allocations, depending on the programmes concerned, are made on a national or other non-county basis in the form of grant funding.  </p>  <p>  Grant funding is provided primarily on the basis of vouched expenditure, as opposed to specific up front annual allocations, once all necessary requirements as detailed in grant assistance schemes are met by the bodies/organisations concerned and that appropriate systems and procedures are in place to ensure the exercise of proper financial controls. Local Property Tax (LPT) allocations are an exception to this, as LPT has replaced exchequer funded general purpose grants, and, for the most part, forms part of local authority expenditure as decided by the elected members in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001.</p>  <p>  All Departments have an individual responsibility in relation to the management and accountability for grants in accordance with Circular 13/2014. Furthermore the Local Government Audit Service has a primary function in providing an independent opinion on the Annual Financial Statements of Local Authorities, and this function provides independent scrutiny of local authorities and other local bodies.</p></reply>

This project is the result of an innovative collaboration between the two AHBs and DLRCC and includes 105 social housing homes at the same location. </p>  <p>  The 50 purpose-built Cost Rental apartments have been allocated and the selected tenants began moving into their new homes from the 14th of March 2022. The cost-covering rent for these two-bedroom apartments is &euro;1,200 per month, which represents a significant discount of approximately 40% on market prices in the area (c. &euro;2,000). </p>  <p>  The Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Cost Rental Designation) Regulations 2021, which came into effect on 19 August 2021, govern the process by which the owners of properties may obtain the designation of these as Cost Rental dwellings. This applies to any private or public body, including a Local Authority, AHBs, or the Land Development Agency. This designation is operated on an opt-in basis, but obtaining a designation is treated as a pre-requisite condition for Cost Rental properties that utilise funding from Departmental schemes, such as the Affordable Housing Fund and the Cost Rental Equity Loan. </p>  <p>  As per the regulations, the applicant must propose an &ldquo;initial maximum rent&rdquo; for the dwelling. This is a year-one starting rent for that specific property, based on a financial cash-flow, which must be modelled over a stated period of at least 40 years (the &ldquo;cost calculation period&rdquo;). The applicant must also propose a minimum length of time over which the designation will apply (the &ldquo;minimum cost rental period&rdquo;), which must be at least as long as the cost calculation period. </p>  <p>  Having regard to these regulations, my Department reviewed the two applications from each AHB for the Cost Rental Designation of their portion (25 homes each) at the development, based on this initial maximum rent of &euro;1,200 per two-bedroom home. The Housing Agency completed a financial assessment for these applications on behalf of my Department, using the information provided by the Respond and Tuath AHBs and found both applications to be in accordance with said regulations, including that the rents proposed were accurate reflections of the costs incurred. Subsequent to this, I formally designated these homes as Cost Rental on 11th March 2022, for a period of 70 years, in line with the legislation and regulations. </p></reply>

This funding programme was introduced in 2014 and has to the end of 2021 returned 18,527 properties to use with funding of almost &euro;261 million from my Department.</p>  <p>  Under the Energy Efficiency Programme, my Department funds the carrying out of retrofitting works to local authority dwellings.

A total of &euro;50m has been made available nationally to support the 2022 regeneration programmes in addressing the causes of disadvantage in these communities through a holistic programme of physical, social and economic regeneration.</p>  <p>  In addition, work is also ongoing with the local authority sector, through the City and County Management Association to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach as referenced in Housing for All, policy objective 20.6. This will require the implementation of a centrally hosted ICT system within the LGMA to support the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes which will be supported by my Department&rsquo;s stock improvement funding programmes. It is envisaged surveys will commence in 2022.</p></reply>

Each Local Authority submitted the first iteration of their plans in December and my officials have now met with each authority. The final Delivery Action Plans are anticipated to be published in Q2 of this year.</p>  <p>  Over the period to 2030, the Government's Housing for All strategy commits to delivering a total of 18,000 Cost Rental homes. Delivery will increase incrementally, to an average of 2,000 Cost Rental homes per year.  This includes a target of c4,000 for the delivery of Cost Rental homes by Approved Housing Bodies utilising the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) over the years 2022-2022</p>  <p>  The CREL scheme has been designed as a method for funding the delivery of Cost Rental housing by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). CREL provides funding for up to 30% of the capital costs of providing Cost Rental homes, with simple interest at 1% for 40 years. Legislative provision was made for the scheme under Section 40 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021, which enables the Housing Agency to issue loans to AHBs for this purpose</p>  <p>  Rent levels for Cost Rental tenancies are based on the cost of the provision of homes, rather than being subject to market driven movement. State subventions therefore help to reduce the starting rents in the Cost Rental properties provided to those in the middle-income cohort. Approval in principle was confirmed for approximately 900 Cost Rental homes to be delivered by AHBs under the CREL scheme over the period 2021-2023.</p></reply>

The table below sets out the average cost to the exchequer in 2021 of social housing delivery across a range of programmes. </p><p>The Social Housing PPP Programme is being delivered through the &lsquo;availability&rsquo;-based PPP model. Under this type of contract, a PPP consortium, as the private partner, designs, builds, finances, maintains and operates the relevant bundle of social housing units in return for a monthly &lsquo;availability&rsquo; and performance-based payment (or unitary charge) made over the operating period. The duration of the contract is the construction period plus a 25-year operating period and no unitary charge payments are made until the homes are constructed and available to house tenants.</p><p>The estimated full value of Bundle 1 (534 units) and Bundle 2 (465 units) of the Social Housing PPP contracts in nominal terms is &euro;301 million and &euro;253 million respectively (both figures are exclusive of VAT and include a forecast of inflation). Over the lifetime of the contract, this equates to an average of approximately &euro;1m per month, (exclusive of VAT and inclusive of an allowance for inflation), or approximately &euro;1,900 per unit per month for bundle 1 and approximately &euro;0.84m per month, (exclusive of VAT and inclusive of an allowance for inflation), or approximately &euro;1,800 per unit per month for bundle 2. This cost includes all construction, maintenance, operating, lifecycle, tenancy management and financing costs. Service provision that is included in the contract includes building and asset management, waste management, security, void management, tenant helpdesk services, and the provision of community development services. At the end of the 25-year operating period, the units are handed over to the relevant local authority in a pre-defined condition. In 2021, the remaining 150 units in Bundle 1 and all units in Bundle 2 were delivered. <table>    <tr>       <th>Funding </th>       <th>2021 Average</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cost Rental Equity   Loan</td>       <td>&euro;109,905 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CALF Construction</td>       <td>&euro;54,695  </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CALF Turnkey</td>       <td>&euro;63,424 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CALF Part V</td>       <td>&euro;32,360  </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CAS Construction</td>       <td>&euro;222,630 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CAS Turnkey</td>       <td>&euro;231,105 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CAS Part V</td>       <td>&euro;77,750 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SHCIP Construction</td>       <td>&euro;249,349 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SHCIP Turnkey</td>       <td>&euro;256,262 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SHCIP Part V</td>       <td>&euro;278,373 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Note 1</b>: The information provided above is based on the financial information available to the Department.

The CALF Capital Outlay represents the average amount of CALF funding provided by the exchequer. (A maximum of 30%) </p><p><b>Note 3:</b>Agreement on Part V arrangements are a matter for the local authorities. In some cases the Part V average is affected by delivery of homes that were subject to agreements prior to the current Part V arrangements. Complete details of PART V arrangements are available from the local authorities. It should be noted that some Part Vs, while recorded as delivered in 2021, costs have not been claimed or recouped as yet and so are excluded from the average costs below. The CAS Part V average is based on the cost of providing one unit in a shared accommodation dwelling.</p><p><b>Note 4:</b>For SHIP Construction projects it should be noted that the averages predominantly relate to new build projects but also include some projects delivering new homes via refurbishment/conversion of existing/derelict properties. These averages represent projects of various designs, types of units (houses, apartments, duplexes) and size (number of bedrooms etc.). The averages reflect current Department approved amounts, which may be subject to final adjustment (pending conclusion of contractor final accounts, etc.). The table reflects all-in delivery costs, which include (as applicable) construction costs, along with site / property purchase costs, fees, utilities, site investigations/surveys, local authority in-house fees, public art etc.</p><p><b>Note 5:</b>In terms of Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL), the figure above represents the average cost for funding 30% of the capital costs of providing the 65 CREL-funded Cost Rental homes delivered in 2021. The Housing Finance Agency funds the remaining 70% of capital costs for these developments.  </p></reply>

However, Cork County has advised that three people died while residing in emergency accommodation in the local authority area  in 2021. Each of these deaths is a tragedy and I extend my sympathies to the families concerned. The deaths of people availing of homeless services are a concern and are being taken very seriously. It is important that the facts are established concerning the circumstances involved, and that the response is based on the best knowledge and evidence available.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at the local level.</p>  <p>  My Department publishes a detailed monthly report on homelessness, based on data provided by housing authorities. The Report outlines details of individuals utilising State-funded emergency accommodation arrangements that are overseen by housing authorities. The Reports are available on my Department's website at the following link:  www.housing.gov.ie/housing/homelessness/other/homelessness-data</p>  <p>  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive also records death notifications from all its funded residential and outreach services, in line with procedure agreed with the HSE.</p>  <p>  A pilot study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally is being undertaken by the Health Research Board (HRB) on behalf of the Department of Health.  It is hoped that the HRB will be in a position to publish the study shortly. The research is applying the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, involves the review of approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts. My Department will engage with the Department of Health on completion of this study.</p>  <p>  It is vital that we continue to deliver the appropriate measures to support all individuals experiencing homelessness. My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities in doing this.</p></reply>

All private landlords, Approved Housing Bodies and providers of Student Specific Accommodation are required to register their tenancies with the RTB. This allows the RTB to collect and provide definitive data on the rental sector and for transparency across the rental sector through the public register of tenancies; thus, enabling a better understanding of the sector.</p><p>Section 136(b) of the RTA requires that when a landlord is registering a tenancy with the RTB, &lsquo;the name, address where the landlord ordinarily resides, any other address for correspondence the landlord may wish to provide and the personal public service number (if any) of the landlord and, where the application is made by his or her authorised agent, the name, address for correspondence and personal public service number (if any) of the agent&rsquo; must be provided as part of the application process.</p><p>For data protection reasons, the names of landlords and tenants are not published on the RTB&rsquo;s public register of tenancies.</p><p>The RTB has registration enforcement powers to pursue landlords who have not complied with their obligation to register their tenancies. Failure to register is an offence which may result in a criminal conviction, a fine of up to &euro;4,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment. The RTB, receives information from different sources regarding whether a tenancy is registered or not, including local authorities, members of the public, RTB checks and follow-ups and the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>The RTB has a dedicated Investigations and Sanctions unit to investigate certain potential breaches of rental law by a landlord referred to as improper conduct under Schedule 2 to the RTA, one of which is a failure to register a tenancy with the RTB within one month of the tenancy commencing. The Investigations and Sanctions Unit can initiate an investigation either as a result of information received from members of the public or as a result of information gathered from records that the RTB has access to under the RTA.  If a landlord is found to have engaged in improper conduct, a sanction may be imposed on them by an independent decision maker which may comprise one or all of the following - a written caution,  a financial penalty of up to &euro;15,000 and a payment of up to &euro;15,000 in respect of related RTB investigation costs.</p><p>In order to ensure that the RTB is fully resourced to deliver on its ever increasing mandate, I secured &euro;11 million current funding for the RTB&rsquo;s operational costs in 2022.</p><p>The RTB received sanction for an additional 41 staff since 2019 to ensure that its enhanced powers and the new legislative provisions are fully implemented and enforced. The authorised staff complement for the RTB is now 106.4 Whole Time Equivalents.</p><p>Under Housing for All, The Government will also facilitate increased enforcement of registration of tenancy requirements. Enforcement will be generally enhanced through measures such as the expansion of data-sharing arrangements between the Revenue Commissioners and the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to assist in enforcement of residential tenancy obligations.</p><p>My Department continues to engage with the RTB to guarantee that it has the funds and staffing that is required to carry out its role as a regulator of the rental sector.</p></reply>

It is not a matter for Irish Water to determine how a public Group Water Scheme chooses to charge its members.</p><p>In this regard, it should be noted that my Department provides funding through an annual subsidy, payable by local authorities, towards the operational and management costs of group water schemes supplying water for domestic use.</p><p>The charging arrangements for Irish Water customers is a matter in the first instance for Irish Water. Any issues, which cannot be resolved by Irish Water to the satisfaction of the customer can be referred under the formal complaints process to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) whose decision on the matter is binding on Irish Water. </p><p>On 10 February 2022, the CRU published a proposed decision paper on updated charging arrangements for public Group Water Schemes and invited responses on the proposed decision. The response period is now closed, and the CRU will finalise its paper in due course.</p><p>It may also be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

Housing for All includes eighteen distinct actions on homelessness. Two of these actions relate specifically to the provision of supports for families and children and in enabling their exit from homelessness. There is a commitment to enhance family support and prevention and early intervention services for children and their families through a multi-agency and coordinated response, and the dissemination of innovative practice. There is also a commitment to identify and provide enhanced tenancy sustainment supports to families experiencing long-term homelessness to help them exit from homelessness and maintain their homes. These actions are being delivered with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p>  <p>  Cooperation through joined-up policy and action are key to addressing all forms of homelessness.  A key initiative that I have put in place is the National Homeless Action Committee (NHAC), which I chair and which meets on a quarterly basis. NHAC is a cross-governmental and inter-agency oversight group with membership drawn from key Departments, State agencies and bodies involved in addressing homelessness. The overarching objective of NHAC is to drive delivery of homeless actions, including those under the Government&rsquo;s Housing for All plan.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at the local level. Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities, with additional supports, including the provision of family supports, provided to families by Tusla.</p>  <p>  Local authorities are independent in the exercise of their functions and, as such, applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. Lone parents are entitled to access all of the housing support delivery mechanisms on an equal basis with all other citizens.</p>  <p>  The increases in family homelessness seen in recent months are a serious concern for my Department and for the Government. We are acting to address this &ndash; in the short term and strategically over the months and years ahead. Over 5,200 adults and their dependant children exited homelessness in 2021. All of these exits were to homes with tenancies.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to prioritise responses for all families, including lone parents, experiencing homelessness and this is being reflected in both strategic policy and in specific actions.</p></reply>

Due to the complex nature of the Foreign Birth Registration process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of Foreign Birth Registration applications at this time. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of Foreign Birth Registration staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period.</p>  <p>  The application of the father in this case was registered on 8 April 2020. Processing of this application has commenced. The applications of the children were received on 29 September 2020, and are being stored in a secure environment.</p>  <p>  The FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt. FBR staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year.</p></reply>

The Passport Service takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport very seriously.  The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.</p></reply>

That report highlighted how Ireland uses diplomatic, development and humanitarian tools, aligned with flexible funding models to deliver results.  It is this combined model which is being used to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s response to those most affected by Russia&rsquo;s war in Ukraine. </p>  <p>  As part of the diplomatic response to the invasion, Ireland has been at the forefront of EU efforts and those across the UN system to respond to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  As an elected member of the UN Security Council, Ireland has called for Russia&rsquo;s immediate withdrawal of troops from the entire territory of Ukraine, and demanded that the Russian Federation uphold its obligations under international law.  </p>  <p>  Minister Coveney visited Kyiv on 14 April, where he met with members of Ukraine&rsquo;s government and visited the town of Bucha where a number of mass graves have been discovered.  Following this visit the Minister addressed the UN Security Council on 19 April, calling for an immediate halt to Russian aggression, highlighting the devastating humanitarian toll on Ukraine&rsquo;s people, and calling for full accountability for the perpetrators of crimes as a result of Russia&rsquo;s invasion. </p>  <p>  The Irish Aid humanitarian response has been most particularly focused on those who remain in Ukraine or in neighbouring countries, such as Moldova.  This has so far been financed from within the 2022 ODA budget allocation, itself substantially increased on the 2021 allocation, and which each year responds to unanticipated humanitarian crises.  Prepositioned Irish Aid funds with key UN agencies, and the ICRC, meant that those organisations were able to respond on the ground in Ukraine immediately.  To this, an additional dedicated &euro;20 million Irish Aid humanitarian package, from within existing ODA but new funding to Ukraine, is responding to the humanitarian response in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  Other Irish Aid assistance is also being explored. Ireland also joined a group of more than 40 States in referring the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court and will provide additional funding of &euro;3 million to the ICC to assist in the investigation of the situation in Ukraine, along with other situations before the court.</p>  <p>  This funding complements the generous contributions made by so many citizens to Irish and other humanitarian organisations who are responding to the needs of those affected by the conflict: many of these organisations receive core funding from Irish Aid.  In addition, I have activated the Rapid Response Register, with experts from the Register deploying to UN partners in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  OECD rules allow that some elements of the first year costs arising from accommodating refugees in Ireland can be counted as ODA, with the statistical base for those coming from Ukraine yet to finalised.  The determination is made in arrears but is likely to exceed Budget Day estimations for this portion of ODA.</p>  <p>  Conscious of wider global humanitarian need, itself being affected by the invasion of Ukraine and its impact, for example, on world food prices, Irish Aid continues to respond generously to those most impacted by other crises, including Syria, Yemen and Somalia.</p></reply>

These sanctions are only effective in so far as they are properly implemented. Ireland, along with EU partners, is working to ensure that EU sanctions are fully implemented and enforced, including through full and effective application of the asset freezes and prohibitions on making funds available to those individuals and entities included on the Ukraine-related sanctions list. </p>  <p>  Financial institutions report funds frozen under EU sanctions to the Central Bank of Ireland, and details are in turn notified to the European Commission. The total value of funds frozen to 22 April is approximately EUR 1.2 billion. It is expected that more notifications will be received as financial institutions complete due diligence procedures, and to reflect ongoing additions to the sanctions list. Given its confidential nature, the Department is not in a position to provide more detailed information on the frozen funds.  </p>  <p>  The three national competent authorities for sanctions in Ireland are the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Central Bank of Ireland. The competent authorities are empowered to issue authorisations to derogate from EU sanctions regimes, where this is provided for in the relevant EU legal acts. </p>  <p>  EU sanctions regimes normally include provisions to allow listed individuals and entities to apply for derogations to sanctions in very specific circumstances, such as to satisfy basic needs such as payments for food, rent or medical treatment, or to pay legal fees or bank fees.</p>  <p>  To date, the Department of Foreign Affairs has received an application from one entity for an authorisation under Council Regulation (EU) No 269/2014 of 17 March 2014 concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, as amended. The Department is not in a position to provide any further details on this authorisation request. The Department understands that the other competent authorities have also received applications for authorisations. </p>  <p>  EU sanctions require that the assets of listed individuals and entities be frozen, so that the sanctioned individual or entity cannot benefit from them economically. This is a fundamental principle of sanctions, which are temporary measures that aim to incentivise changes in behaviour or policy and which are not intended to be punitive. However, some Member States have proposed that assets frozen in the context of the situation in Ukraine could be seized, and used for purposes including the rebuilding of Ukraine. I have expressed openness to this proposal. However, it requires extensive further discussion in order to ensure a robust and clear legal basis, as it would be a departure from current practice. </p>  <p>  In March 2022, the European Commission created the &lsquo;Freeze and Seize&rsquo; Task Force, to ensure coordination among Member States on the implementation of sanctions related to Ukraine. A particular focus of the Task Force is the identification and freezing of assets belonging to Russian and Belarussian oligarchs in the EU. The Task Force is also considering the interplay between sanctions and criminal law measures, with a view to possibly seizing the assets of those included in the sanctions list where their activities may also breach criminal law. As Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Task Force is led by the Department of Justice, that Department would be better placed to provide more information on its work. </p></reply>

This followed an initial reduction in processing time from 40 working days to 35 working days which was made last month, and is a direct result of the staffing and resources the Department has invested in the Passport Service. </p><p>There are currently over 167,000 applications in the Passport Service system. While there is a very high volume of applications, this does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.</p><p>Figures show that of the total number of applications in the system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% of applications in the system are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.</p><p>The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. </p><p>In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. </p><p>In cases of children whose parents are not Irish citizens, the process can sometimes take longer due to the need to ensure that all of the required supporting documentation to prove the child&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship is submitted and correct. Due to the high level of complexity with these particular applications, further documentation is often required, adding to the processing time.</p><p>Of the total number of applications currently in the Passport Service system, 42,600 are first time child applications. 15,000 (35%) of these first time child applications are incomplete. This means that the applicant has either not sent any documentation after they applied online or additional documentation has been requested by the Passport Service. The Passport Service cannot process applications that are not complete.</p><p>The Passport Service is taking a number steps to deal with increased demand on its services:</p><p>- The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports in 2022.</p><p>- A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by over 300 since June 2021. </p><p>- The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021. </p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first time child applications.</p><p>- The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime in this regard.  </p><p>- The Urgent Appointment Service is available for customers who wish to renew their passport at short notice. Customers availing of this service can renew their passport within 1 or 4 days in Dublin, within 4 days in Cork and within 5 days in London.</p><p>- In February, the Passport Service increased the number of appointments at its public offices by 100%, providing an extra 170 Urgent Appointments per week. </p><p>- A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants. </p><p>- A new Passport Service site in Swords, Co. Dublin opened in November 2021 and accommodates 140 staff. Works on expansion of the Passport Service site in Balbriggan began in January 2022 and it is anticipated that this will be completed in the autumn of 2022.  This will accommodate 175 staff.</p><p>- Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue during this busy year. </p><p>- There is an updated Department of Foreign Affairs website, which includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application. </p><p>- The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.</p><p>I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.</p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p></reply>

Due to the complex nature of the FBR process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow approximately 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, and the subsequent reassignment of FBR staff to assist in the provision of essential passport services, the Foreign Birth Registration Service was paused for nearly 15 months across the 2020-2021 period.</p>  <p>  The application referenced was registered on 30 August 2021, and is being stored in a secure environment.</p>  <p>  The FBR service operates a transparent general policy of processing applications in order of receipt. FBR staff continue to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly.</p>  <p>  My Department is fully committed to the continued allocation of additional resources over the coming period to assist with the processing of the Foreign Birth Registration applications currently on hand and the high volume of new applications anticipated this year. </p></reply>

We have also been clear on the need to uphold international law, especially the UN charter. We have also called for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. We have been unwavering in our expression of solidarity to Ukraine, and insisted on its sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.</p>  <p>  On 19 April, I used Ireland&rsquo;s seat at the UN Security Council to brief Council Members about the destruction of civilian infrastructure throughout Ukraine, and the mass grave at Bucha, which I witnessed during my visit to the country on 14 April.

Passport applications from all citizens - whether at home or abroad - are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices, on the basis of the type of application rather than county or country of residence of the applicant. </p>  <p>  The Passport Office in Cork primarily processes domestic paper-based as well as non-domestic online applications.  An Urgent Appointment Service is also available at the Passport Office in Cork for applicants who need to travel within four working days.  It can also facilitate the issuance on the spot of an emergency passport where there is an urgent need to travel for medical reasons or due to a bereavement abroad. </p>  <p>  There are currently 48,000 applications in the system at the Passport Office in Cork. Of these, 25,000 (52%) have been fully completed by the applicant and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 23,000 (48%) are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, it is often the case that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.  The Passport Service cannot process incomplete applications until such time as all documentation has been received.  </p>  <p>  The Passport Service operates three passport printing machines, two of which are located in the main production facility in Balbriggan and the third in the Passport Office in Lower Mount Street, Dublin. All production facilities can print a passport, irrespective of the channel through which the application is processed. The printing system allows for flexibility between printing machines if any one machine has reached capacity. Each passport printer has a printing capacity of 250 passports per hour. I am satisfied that the printing capacity of production equipment currently employed by the Passport Service is sufficient to meet the current and anticipated future demand for passports. </p></reply>

It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks.   </p>  <p>  The White Paper, in addressing Air Corps capability, provided for the replacement of the Cessnas and Casa 235 fleets.  The Cessnas have now been replaced by three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role providing a substantially increased capability with their state of the art surveillance technology.   A further Pilatus PC-12 was also procured arising from the demands of Covid.  A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft to replace the two Casa 235s was signed with Airbus in 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.  These C295s are larger and more capable aircraft than those they replace and will enable the Air Corps to conduct maritime patrols and surveillance across Ireland's area of maritime interest, with enhanced capabilities.</p>  <p>  Equipment projects for the Army include the midlife upgrade of the Army's fleet of 80 Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles which is well underway as well as the completion of the delivery of an additional 30 Armoured Utility Vehicles. The Army's softskin fleet continues to be updated also with over 220 vehicles due for delivery in 2022.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the National Development Plan of &euro;566m over the 2022-2025 timeframe. Within that capital allocation the Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141m. This will enable continued investment in defence equipment, including major platforms, and barracks infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the current events in Ukraine are prompting an open debate and consideration of our defence requirements.  I fully accept there is an ongoing requirement to consider whether the capabilities we maintain are appropriate, having regard to the security environment, the roles that we wish the Defence Forces to undertake, and likely risks.    </p>  <p>  The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces was published on the 9th February 2022.  The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  The Commission's report is being fully considered, in consultation with Ministerial colleagues and other stakeholders.   The intent is to revert to Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess. </p>  <p>  The establishment of an independent Commission on the Defence Forces underpins the Government's commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces are fit for purpose, both in terms of meeting immediate requirements and also in terms of seeking to develop a longer term vision beyond 2030.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will note the strong emphasis by the EU on diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the current situation in Ukraine.  Ireland strongly supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, a position I have repeatedly reaffirmed at UN Security Council meetings on Ukraine and in EU meetings.  </p>  <p>  The Government remains resolute in its solidarity and support for Ukraine, and reiterates the call on Russia to cease all hostilities immediately and to withdraw from Ukraine unconditionally. Ireland is providing &euro;20 million in humanitarian assistance to the UN and the Red Cross to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.</p></reply>

Independent evaluation is a central part of the project and the outcome will inform future policy on extending the SIM.  The project includes a number of elements:</p><p>- Provision of in-school therapies (speech and language, occupational)</p><p>- Allocation of SNAs on a frontloaded basis</p><p>- Additional professional supports for the school including psychology, behavioural and professional development</p><p>- Training of SNAs </p><p>In February 2019, the Government approved the trialing of the Model for the 2019/20 school year. Initially designed as a one year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CHO 7 region, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid related work. It was then extended to the 2020/21 school year which was also interrupted by Covid.  </p><p>Progress has been made on aspects of the Model but much remains to be done in terms of in-school implementation and evaluation.  </p><p>The Pilot has recommenced in November 2021 in CHO7 and planning for an expansion is underway at present. </p><p>My Department is consulting with relevant Departments including Taoiseach, Heath and Children and a Memorandum is expected to be brought to Government shortly.</p></reply>

No pro-rata recoupment will be required if the partial divesting is for land only. Decisions are made on receipt of such requests on a case by case basis taking account of issues relating to each individual school.</p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website, ncse.ie/for-schools</p><p>The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually.

It acts in the interests of the public good while upholding and enhancing standards in the teaching profession. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council registers teachers in line with the requirements set out in the Teaching Council Act 2001-2015 and the Teaching Council (Registration) Regulations 2016.Section 30 of the Act makes it a requirement for teachers to register with the Teaching Council in order to be paid from State funds.</p>  <p>  The Council has a streamlined "fast-track" application process in place for Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) who wish to register with the Council. This process is in place for all newly qualified primary and post primary teachers including PME student teachers who are already registered with the Teaching Council under &lsquo;Route 3 &ndash; Further Education&rsquo;.  PME student teachers that are already registered under Route 3 can apply to register under their qualified route of qualification i.e., Route 1 for primary teachers and Route 2 for post-primary teachers, under the &ldquo;fast -track&rdquo; process and will maintain the same registration number. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, an amendment to the Teaching Council Registration Regulations has been approved and signed which will enable student teachers on undergraduate teacher education programmes to apply for registration with the Council under Route 5 &ndash; Student Teachers. These student teachers must have successfully completed?the first two years of their undergraduate teacher education programme. The Council is currently developing systems and processes to support the registration and vetting of these student teachers. Once these are available, all eligible student teachers will be contacted by the Council and invited to apply for registration as a student teacher. </p>  <p>  Student teachers who register with the Teaching Council under Route 5 will be granted registration with conditions for a period of 1 to 2 years depending on their year of qualification. One of such conditions will be that the student teacher must remain a registered teacher on an accredited undergraduate programme in teacher education. On successful completion of their teacher education programme, there will be a &ldquo;fast-track&rdquo; application process in place for student teachers who wish to apply to continue their registration under their qualified route of qualification i.e., Route 1 for primary teachers and Route 2 for post-primary teachers. </p></reply>

The total funding available to provide the programme was &euro;40 million, which was a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.</p>  <p>  The programme&rsquo;s aims were to support pupils to re-engage with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for some who are at key transition stages, help to ensure they could move on to their planned educational placement for the start of the next school year along with their peers.</p>  <p>  For the first time ever, all schools (primary and-post primary) were encouraged to provide summer programmes and the eligibility criteria was extended to include post-primary children with complex needs and children at risk of educational disadvantage. Prior to this expansion, summer programmes were only available to special schools and pupils in special classes in primary schools and in DEIS schools.   Overall, 37,977 pupils participated in the 2021 summer programme across both home and school-based elements, which represented an increase of 65% on participation in the 2020 programme.</p>  <p>  This year&rsquo;s programme is building upon 2021&rsquo;s increased participation figures and in this regard, there will be extensive engagement with stakeholders and promotional material published to promote this year&rsquo;s programme. </p>  <p>  Summer programmes in post primary schools were provided for the first time in 2020, the number of schools who participated increased by over 37% in 2021 and it is hoped building upon last year&rsquo;s success and with increased awareness of the new programme, will see a further increase in the number of schools who are prepared to offer such programmes this year. </p>  <p>  A key objective of this year is to support schools   in offering the summer programme to their students. The aim is to afford schools as much flexibility as possible.  The availability of teachers and SNAs has been identified previously as a concern. In planning for this, the Department has considered feedback from schools and what worked well in 2021. The Department has held further consultation with education partners and stakeholders in this regard. Measures are being put in place to increase the number of teachers available to work on the programme this year, on both the home and school-based programmes.</p>  <p>  The details of the programme are currently being finalised and will shortly be communicated to all schools and published on www.gov.ie.</p></reply>

The Board of Management is accountable to the school patron. </p><p>Accordingly, whereas my Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, it does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regard to individual complaint cases.  My Department's role is to clarify for parents and students how their grievances and complaints against a school can be progressed. </p><p>Where there is cause for complaint from a parent, matters would normally be addressed to the individual teacher or school Principal as appropriate.If matters cannot be resolved at that level, then a complaint can be addressed to the school&rsquo;s Board of Management.  </p><p>A school may have a formal complaints process in which case this should be followed in pursuing any complaint. </p><p>Where a parent is of the view that the school's managerial authority has failed to investigate or adequately investigate their complaint, it is open to the parent to raise the matter with the patron of the school. </p><p>Parents and students may also raise a concern with the Ombudsman for Children. The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised by my Department, provided the parent/student has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions or non-actions of a school has, or, may have, adversely affected the child. </p><p>Further information is available on the Department&rsquo;s website: www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/complaints-about-schools/.</p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website, ncse.ie/for-schools.</p>  <p>  The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually. Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited in order to observe the current deployment of SNA support in the school setting.</p>  <p>  The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided. </p>  <p>  Where a school is dissatisfied with how their exceptional review has been processed or is dissatisfied with the outcome of their exceptional review they can appeal. Applications for Appeal may be submitted through the NCSE Schools Portal: ncse.ie/school-support. </p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit Data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department&rsquo;s projections of school place requirements. Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, the Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand. </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  The Department's projections of post primary school place requirements in East Cork show an anticipated continued growth in enrolments in the short- to medium-term. </p>  <p>  In response to meeting the demand for projected future demographic demand in the area, a new post-primary school, Carrigtwohill Community College, was established in 2016. A project to deliver a new, modern 1,000 pupil permanent school building for the school is underway. The building project for Carrigtwohill campus will accommodate two primary schools and a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school building for Carrigtwohill Community College and is being delivered under the Department&rsquo;s Design and Build Programme. This delivery programme uses a professional external Project Management team to progress the project through the stages of architectural planning, tendering and construction.  </p>  <p>  The Letter of Intent (LOI) issued on the 15th of February 2022 to the preferred tenderer.  This allows the preferred bidder to put in place the Bond, Insurances and confirmations of all legal arrangements required under the Contract.  Following receipt of all the necessary documentation, the Department will be in a position to issue the Letter of Acceptance (LOA), which will allow the contractor to mobilise on site. My Department will advise the Board of Management when the Letter of Acceptance issues.</p>  <p>  Once the successful contractor is appointed, the Department&rsquo;s project manager will liaise with the contractor to ensure that the Community College is prioritised and delivered as early as possible within the Contractor&rsquo;s Programme of Works for the campus.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, additional accommodation has been approved for Carrigtwohill Community College for September 2022 which includes 6 general classrooms, a home-economics room, SEN Class and ancillary accommodation. This accommodation is being delivered by Cork ETB.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s school building programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. </p>  <p>  An extension at St. Colman's Community College, Midleton has recently been completed to cater for up to 1,000 pupils. A number of other large scale school building projects are also in train to cater for similar pupil numbers. This includes expanded capacity at Christian Brothers Secondary School and St. Mary's High School in Midleton. In addition, St. Aloysius College, Carrigtwohill will expand to cater for 1,000 pupils, Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide in Youghal for 1,200 pupils, and Col&aacute;iste Mhuire and Carrignafoy Community College, both in Cobh, for 600 and over 700 pupils respectively. </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, the Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands. It is expected that the enrolment pressures in East Cork, and other areas, will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak.</p>  <p>  While the Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in East Cork, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  - Duplication  of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area</p>  <p>  - School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in  their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  - Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  - External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  The Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in East Cork areas, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.</p>  <p>  The Department understands that principals of schools in the area have had a number of meetings to establish an overall picture of school place requirements for the next academic year.  The Department will continue to have close engagement with the relevant school patrons and authorities in order to monitor the situation and implement any solutions which may be required.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Department will continue to work to advance the planned and current building projects in East Cork and to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future.</p>  <p>  The Department is working to ensure that sufficient capacity is in place to meet the needs of post-primary schools in the Cork East school area through the delivery of the building projects that are planned or in train as well as through the Department&rsquo;s engagement with patron bodies in identifying specific capacity pressure points priorities for September 2022 which will necessitate specific action.  The Department is satisfied that the current planned projects for the school planning area will cater for future demand without the necessity for a further post-primary school in Midleton but will keep the planning area under review.</p></reply>

It is expected that the enrolment pressures in these, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the area in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) including schools in East Cork can also be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Department is continuing to engage with all patrons of schools in the area referred to in order to identify any additional required interim solutions to meet the need for post primary places. My Department will continue to work to advance these and other projects in East Cork and to ensure sufficient mainstream and SEN school places at both primary and post primary level.</p></reply>

The Policy outlines a comprehensive and whole-school approach in schools to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health, focusing on the entire school community, as well as groups and individual young people with identified need.  This spans the curriculum in schools, culture and environment, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care, guidance counselling and the provision of professional development for teachers.   This approach provides children and young people with opportunities to:</p>  <p>  - build core social and emotional skills and competencies</p>  <p>  - experience supportive relationships within the school setting</p>  <p>  - be part of a school environment and culture that feels  both physically and psychologically safe, in which they feel a sense of  belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported</p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. </p>  <p>  A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience.  The services support schools to provide strong universal support at the level of whole school and classroom, more targeted support for some children and young people who may be at risk, and more individualised support for those with greatest need.  </p>  <p>  At present, as an organization working in the field of mental health promotion, responsibility</p>  <p>  for the funding of Jigsaw rests primarily with the Department of Health, but I am aware of the excellent work that Jigsaw carries out in the community to support the mental health of our young people.  </p></reply>

My Department is fully committed to ensuring that wellbeing is at the core of the ethos of all schools in Ireland, and that this is done through the implementation of the Wellbeing Policy Statement. The approach proposed in the Wellbeing Policy Statement is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to:</p><p>- build core social and emotional skills and competencies</p><p>- experience supportive relationships within the school setting</p><p>- be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe, in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported</p><p>Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. </p><p>Since the wellbeing policy was published, work has taken place to realise the vision set out in the Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy by the Department&rsquo;s support services and agencies.  Following an action research project involving thirty schools, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) has developed Continuing Professional Development (CPD) to support schools as they engage in a wellbeing promotion process. This national rollout of CPD commenced in March 2022 and is available to all schools. </p><p>This CPD will be supplemented with a parallel resource for schools developed by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), offering a series of webinars on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools, including on trauma-informed approaches.The approaches outlined in the webinars are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practising psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs.  </p><p>NEPS provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist. </p><p>The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. Professional learning activities to support children/young people with social/emotional/mental health difficulties and to promote positive wellbeing in school include the FRIENDS<b></b>programmes. These are evidence-based anxiety prevention and resilience building programmes, which foster self-concept and a sense of school belonging using Cognitive Behavioural Therapeutically-informed approaches. Friends programmes help students to develop resilience by teaching them effective strategies to cope with, problem solve and manage all kinds of emotional distress, including worry, stress, change and anxiety. The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme is an evidence-based programme that equips teachers to manage their classrooms effectively to prevent and reduce behavioural problems while promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and emotional and social competence.</p><p>A dedicated wellbeing portal has been developed and is now available, bringing together all the wellbeing supports and resources that have been developed by the Department and the Department&rsquo;s support service together and these are available on the gov.ie website.</p><p>Active School Flag (ASF) is a Department of Education and Skills initiative supported by Healthy Ireland, and part of the National Physical Activity Plan.</p><p>My Department funds the Active School Flag (ASF) and this initiative is also supported by Healthy Ireland. The ASF initiative provides schools with a framework to guide, support and incentivise them to work towards achieving a physically educated and physically active school community.</p></reply>

Through this intensive intervention, we have seen an additional 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year. </p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>The NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>Budget 2022 provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022/2023 school year. These additional classes will provide over 1,700 new places from September next. </p><p>The NCSE is currently engaging in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022/2023 school year and beyond. Both my Department and the NCSE are always grateful to schools who express a willingness to open a special class to meet the educational needs of students in their local communities.  It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>There are Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) located across the country and they have a specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the education necessary for their children, including in identifying suitable school placements.  </p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the type and location of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at ncse.ie/special-classes</p><p>In respect of the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding the individual placement I will arrange to have it referred to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

The total funding available to provide the programme was &euro;40 million, which was a 100% increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.  The range of programmes on offer built on the success of the expanded programmes that ran in 2020 and incorporated feedback from education stakeholders.  For the first time, all primary schools were given the opportunity to run a 2-3 week inclusion programme, an expansion to all post-primary schools that had been previously only been available in DEIS post-primary schools in 2020.  In addition, enhanced supports provided included measures to reduce the administrative burden, provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes, earlier payment to school staff and provision to recruit newly qualified teachers to work on the programme.  </p><p>As primary schools had the option of running multiple programmes the information requested by the Deputy for 2021 is broken down into the different

This assessment component will have a weighting of 40% of the total marks available.</p>  <p>  I know that in moving to externally moderated, teacher based forms of assessment some teachers, parents and students may have concerns. The NCCA and SEC will have extensive engagement with teachers and other stakeholders as the necessary development work progresses. The &ldquo;network schools&rdquo; approach will be used to introduce this aspect of Senior Cycle development, which will allow each element of the revised curriculum and assessment approaches to be carefully worked through. </p>  <p>  There is no doubt that teacher based assessment broadens the range of skills or types of learning that can be assessed. It must be ensured that the additional components are adding that value by ensuring they do test additional skills beyond those already tested by written examination. We must also ensure, in the design of teacher assessment and other additional components that there is equity for all students and that we do not create any disadvantage for any student. </p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area. </p>  <p>  The Department additionally consults with school patron bodies in order to identify areas with pressures on enrolments.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the  capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage as well as language of instruction, i.e. Irish or English, of new schools. Parental preferences, as well as other considerations such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area (including Irish-medium provision), are key to the decision-making process and to whether at post-primary level a school would take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelchol&aacute;iste or whether, if English-medium, the school would include an Irish-medium unit or &ldquo;Aonad&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Most new post-primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of 600 &ndash; 1,000 students.  A lower threshold of 400 students may apply to Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, having regard to the alternative of establishing an Aonad within a school.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a new policy on Irish-medium education outside of Gaeltacht areas.  The aim of this policy is to provide a framework for the provision of high quality Irish-medium education outside of Gaeltacht areas. The new policy will build on the progress which has been made in the development of the Irish-medium education sector as a result of the implementation of the  Policy on Gaeltacht Education.  The key objectives of the policy are in accordance with the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish language 2010-2030 and the Programme for Government 2020 and include considering how opportunities for the establishment of Gaelscoileanna and Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; can be increased; and developing a clear policy on the establishment of Aonaid l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge in existing English-medium post-primary schools to strengthen Irish-medium educational provision.  An interdepartmental working group was established within my Department in 2021 to progress this important work.  A steering group, comprised of relevant stakeholders, has been established to oversee the development of the new policy and to facilitate key stakeholder involvement in its development. The first meeting of the steering group took place recently. I am looking forward to working with the steering group and other relevant interested parties to progress this important work.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.</p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. </p>  <p>  In June 2021, as part of phase 1 of the review, the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, measures were approved which allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time.  This arrangement is in place for the current school year pending completion of the full review of the School Transport Scheme </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway.  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. </p></reply>

Under this scheme, my Department provided funding of &euro;17.2 million in 2021 to all of these schools. Schools participating in my Department&rsquo;s DEIS Programme receive an enhanced rate of book grant. </p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and guardians. In order to support the establishment of book rental schemes,  my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to all primary schools.   </p>  <p>  From the information available to my Department currently, approximately 96% of all primary schools and 69% of all post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school. Schools are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those students most in need. </p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1million was provided under Budget 2020 to provide free books in DEIS primary schools on a pilot basis. This funding was allocated to 102 DEIS primary schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020/21 school year. The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents.</p>  <p>  Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per pupil.  This pilot provided an additional &euro;64 per pupil to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per pupil enrolled in the school. This is in line with the costings as set out in the 2019 Barnardos report on the Real Cost of School which states that &euro;85 is the average cost of school books at primary school. </p>  <p>  Funding continued for the 2021/22 school year and the effectiveness and impact of the pilot will be evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible. </p></reply>

The current policy within my Department is not to endorse any particular product or publication, including textbooks. There are a small number of exceptions where my Department has procured textbooks or resources in order to fill a need &ndash; for example with Leaving certificate Japanese and Italian. However, as with all textbooks there is no obligation for a school to use these in their delivery of the curriculum. Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at post-primary, determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the decisions on which textbooks to use in primary and post-primary schools are taken at school level. </p>  <p>  The majority of textbooks are commissioned and published by educational publishers, and schools select their books from those available from a number of publishers. The Irish Educational Publishers Association (IEPA) meets with the NCCA in order to discuss the curriculum and to be made aware of any requirements in the curriculum. However the content of any individual textbook is determined by the publisher themselves, and therefore any queries regarding specific content in any particular textbook should be directed to the publisher.</p>  <p>  The role of the school is to provide an appropriate education for all its pupils.  A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms.</p></reply>

Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new SET posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022/23.  This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385. </p><p>The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support.</p><p>The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.  In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act.</p><p>When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.</p><p>Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p><p>Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2022/23 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile. </p><p>If your school wishes to make an exceptional needs review appeal they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/for-schools  </p></reply>

Urban settlements are towns with a population of 1,500 or more, while settlements with a population of less than 1,500 are classified as rural.

A ballot was undertaken and the result was 95% agreement in favour of the deal.  I am very pleased to hear of this overwhelmingly positive result on what has been a long running issue, the resolution of which has been a priority for me since my appointment.  </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for these staff under grant schemes, and that where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.  On that basis, there has been extensive engagement between my Department and school management bodies to work towards a resolution. I would also like to acknowledge the willingness of F&oacute;rsa and in particular the school secretary representatives for their constructive engagement in this process, and to recognise the support of Minister McGrath and his officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at all stages of the negotiations.</p>  <p>  The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.  Secretaries may also choose to receive additional pay to ensure they no longer need to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The final element of the package will introduce standardised arrangements in respect of annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.</p>  <p>  The work to implement this agreement will include a complex process of assimilating each individual secretary to the new terms and conditions which will vary depending on individual circumstances. The Department will expedite this process and will communicate further as the work progresses.</p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries at present, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff.  Once the implementation plan for secretaries has been put in place, intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p></reply>

It is supported by an Implementation Group and a number of working groups which are considering specific areas of policy. </p>  <p>  The Teacher Supply Action Plan, published in November 2018, includes a range of actions under four policy headings: data/research to support teacher supply planning; higher education; policies and arrangements impacting on teacher supply; and communications / promotion of the teaching profession.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been put in place to increase the supply of teachers at post-primary level, particularly in subjects where difficulties in recruitment have been reported.</p>  <p>  In the 2019/20 school year, my department introduced the &lsquo;Scheme to Share Teachers between Recognised Post-Primary Schools&rsquo; to facilitate an arrangement whereby two schools can share a teacher to teach subjects in both schools. The objectives of the Scheme are to assist schools in filling vacancies in high priority subjects and to enhance teaching hours for teachers in employment on less than full hours.  Circular 0015/2019 refers. </p>  <p>  Our education partners have also put in place a number of measures which are aimed at matching teachers with teaching vacancies.  Turasabhaile, a service developed by the post-primary school management bodies and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, matches registered teachers, resident abroad with post-primary vacancies in schools in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network is also developing a new central portal for the recruitment of teachers to long-term positions in both primary and post-primary schools. It is anticipated that this portal will be available to schools and teachers in the coming period.</p>  <p>The various measures to support teacher supply are underpinned by the Teaching Transforms campaign, which promotes the teaching profession and encourages students to follow a career in teaching. The campaign uses digital, radio and video media, and is supported by a dedicated webpage, www.gov.ie/teachingtransforms.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue, with the cooperation of the education partners, to develop and implement measures to address challenges faced by schools and to support the supply of teachers to our schools.</p></reply>

At primary level, this situation generally arises to cater for a school&rsquo;s accommodation requirements where an additional teaching post has been sanctioned by Teacher Allocation Section, or the requirement for a new class for pupils with special education needs has been identified by the NCSE, and all available alternative accommodation within the school is already being used for classroom purposes.</p>  <p>  The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics.

Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new SET posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022/23.  This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385. </p>  <p>  The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support.  </p>  <p>  The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.  In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act. </p>  <p>  When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.   </p>  <p>  Schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p>  <p>  Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p>  <p>  A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2022/23 school year.</p>  <p>  Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p>  <p>  It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. </p>  <p>  These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p>  <p>  A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile. </p>  <p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review appeal they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/for-schools  </p></reply>

The Department is liaising with the teams to ensure all necessary supports for the Ukrainian children are provided as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The primary role of the REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures and the initial focus will be on assisting families in securing school places. REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support the Department of Education in developing new capacity where required, and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined area.</p>  <p>  These teams will ensure that clear, accessible information flows are in place between schools, local education support services and national support structures in relation to people arriving from Ukraine.</p>  <p>Contact information for REALT teams can be found at www.gov.ie/en/publication/48639-information-for-schools-ukraine/#regional-education-and-language-teams-realt  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage with stakeholders, provide updated guidance and address any issues or concerns as they emerge.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs including the allocation of SNAs and reviews. The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.  Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools  </p>  <p>  The Special Education Teaching (SET) allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile. This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools based on a diagnosis of disability.</p>  <p>  The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p>  <p>  The allocation gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p>  <p>  The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model. The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it. </p>  <p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  Detailed information on the NCSE review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools  </p>  <p>  In relation to the school as outlined in the details supplied and in regards to their SET allocation, the re-profiling for the 2022/2023 school year has been completed and the school has been advised in writing by the NCSE of a significant increase in their SET allocation from the start of the next school year (September 2022), details of the new allocation is also available on the NCSE website.</p></reply>

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, in consultation with parents, having regard to the ethos of the school.  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary Junior Cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. My Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  In April 2018, the then Minister for Education and Skills asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a major review of RSE in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA in December, 2019.</p>  <p>  The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.</p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools.  </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the work of the NCCA has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE/RSE may be approached in a more holistic way. This work is progressing well and sections of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE JC Short Course and SC SPHE Framework) have now been published.  </p>  <p>  The NCCA online SPHE toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address issues of consent, gender and sexual discrimination and violence, and related topics within the SPHE classroom.  </p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for redeveloping and updating the SPHE curriculum is progressing. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification is due to be agreed at NCCA Council by the summer, with a public consultation to follow when schools return in September. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and rolled out in schools from September 2023. The Senior Cycle updated syllabus will be rolled out in schools in September 2024 followed by the update at Primary level.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, I have recently announced my Department's intention to provide funding for a new postgraduate programme to upskill registered post-primary teachers teaching SPHE/RSE. </p>  <p>  This programme will provide a pathway for progression for post-primary teachers interested in developing their skills in teaching SPHE/RSE and in so doing build capacity and leadership within the teaching profession in relation to the teaching of SPHE/RSE.</p>  <p>   The intention to provide teachers with access to a new postgraduate course to be developed for teachers in post-primary schools teaching SPHE/RSE. Schools and teachers will be supported to access the upskilling programme and course fees will be covered by Department funding.</p>  <p>   This programme will upskill registered post-primary teachers in SPHE/RSE.  In the course of the programme, it is intended that each participant will be provided with high quality pedagogical content knowledge and will be empowered to become an effective and enthusiastic teacher of this subject. The design and delivery of the programmes should recognise recent curricular and other reforms.</p>  <p>  My Department has recently engaged with higher education institutions (HEIs) and it is hoped that a number of HEIs will be interested in designing and developing an upskilling programme.</p></reply>

SNAs are recruited specifically to assist in the care needs of pupils with disabilities in an educational context.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school. The Board of Management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the students in their school and care and safety should be at the centre of all policy and practices. Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions and to provide training for teachers to ensure the safety and welfare of their pupils.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of students for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school.  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. </p>  <p>  The availability and provision of health-related supports, including therapy services, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, and matters in relation to the provision of health-related services should be directed to that body or to the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  Nursing support for children with complex needs in school is provided directly by the HSE or through a HSE funded provider. Where a school has identified children with complex needs who require nursing support, the school should contact the HSE. </p>  <p>  &ldquo;Managing Chronic Health Conditions at School - a resource pack for teachers and parents&rdquo; was produced jointly by the Diabetes Ireland, the Asthma Society of Ireland, Brainwave the Irish Epilepsy Association and Anaphylaxis Ireland to help teachers and parents to work together and provide a safe and enjoyable school environment for students with any one of these conditions.

Irish is also an official language of the European Union.  It is an aim of Government to increase on an incremental basis the use and knowledge of Irish as a community language.</p>  <p>  In recognising the linguistic, social and cultural importance of Irish and English in Ireland, both languages are included as core subjects in the national curricula for recognised primary and secondary level schools and centres for education in Ireland.  This has been the case since the foundation of the State and the importance of the teaching of Irish in this way has been re-affirmed on a number of occasions by the State, including most recently in the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.  All students in Primary and Second Level schools are required to study Irish unless they have been granted a Certificate of Exemption from the study of Irish.  </p>  <p>  The long-standing practice of the Department has been to use circulars as a means for communicating a number of matters including schemes, rules and other conditions associated with the recognition and funding of schools, and setting the terms and conditions of school staff.  Much of that practice evolved in the absence of primary legislation governing the education sector.  Following a national convention in the mid-1990s, a programme of educational reform was initiated. For the first time, this included the enactment of landmark pieces of primary legislation governing the school system. This included the Education Act 1998, the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  While such legislation does permit of the making of regulations in a number of areas, regulations are not required in all situations.  The practice of using administrative circulars which is familiar to schools, teachers and other school staff, and which allows for a necessary degree of flexibility and responsiveness has continued. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Education Act 1998 recognises the particular responsibility of the education system with regard to supporting the Irish language.  Section 6 of the Act provides that every person concerned with the implementation of the Act shall have regard to objects specified therein. These objects include contributing to the realisation of national policy and objectives in relation to the extension of bilingualism in Irish society and in particular the achievement of a greater use of the Irish language at school and in the community (Section 6(i)) and contributing to the maintenance of Irish as the primary community language in Gaeltacht areas (Section 6(j)).  The responsibilities of the Department  in respect of the teaching and promotion of Irish are also apparent from Sections 7(2)(d); 9(f) and (h); 13(3)(f); 31, 41(2)(g); 62(7)(h) and 62(9) thereof.</p>  <p>  Rule 70(3) of the Rules for National Schools (1965) lists Irish as an obligatory subject for pupils in National Schools and Curricula for Irish are prescribed by the minister in accordance with Section 30 of the Education Act 1998. Rule 21(1) of the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools 2004/2005 provides that the approved course for a post-primary school student must include not less than five of the subjects of which one must be Irish.  Students are not required to sit an Irish examination nor is it a requirement to pass an Irish Examination in order to complete the Junior Cycle or the Leaving Certificate.  In that context, the most recent curricular changes at primary and junior cycle level have emphasised not only the importance of learning both languages but also the wider benefits of bilingualism.  The development of these new language curricula reflects my department&rsquo;s reassertion of its commitment to the Irish language and to progressing the language education related actions of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.</p></reply>

Psychologists work within a regional and local office structure serving the needs of schools in their immediate vicinity. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist. NEPS works closely with the HSE and its agencies to ensure those who may require further support are referred on to the appropriate clinical services for intervention and support.</p><p>The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. Professional learning activities to support children/young people with social/emotional/mental health difficulties and to promote positive wellbeing in school include the FRIENDS<b></b>programmes. These are evidence-based anxiety prevention and resilience building programmes, which foster self-concept and a sense of school belonging using Cognitive Behavioural Therapeutically-informed approaches. Friends programmes help students to develop resilience by teaching them effective strategies to cope with, problem solve and manage all kinds of emotional distress, including worry, stress, change and anxiety. The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme is an evidence-based programme that equips teachers to manage their classrooms effectively to prevent and reduce behavioural problems while promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and emotional and social competence.</p><p>NEPS have developed a series of webinars on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools, including on trauma-informed approaches. The approaches outlined in the webinars are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs.</p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in a number of school planning areas including in east Cork.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  - Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area</p>  <p>  - School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  - Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  - External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  My Department is proactive in working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in east Cork to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train. </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands. It is expected that the enrolment pressures in these, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the area in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) including schools in East Cork can also be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p>  <p>  Specifically, in east Cork, there are a number of significant school building projects providing additional capacity at post primary level:</p>  <p>  - Carrigtwohill Community College (76333G) is a co-educational post primary school with an enrolment of 535 for the 2021/2022 school year. A project to provide a  permanent school building for 1,000 pupils is currently at Stage 3.  Interim accommodation has been approved for the 2022/23 school year consisting of 6 general classrooms, 1 home economics room, 1 Class SEN base and 2 social spaces pending delivery of the new build.</p>  <p>  - St  Aloysius College, Carrigtwohill, (62140P) is an all girls post primary school with an enrolment of 792 for the 2021/2022 school year. A project to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils has been devolved to the school authority for delivery.</p>  <p>  - Christian Brothers Secondary School Midleton (62360G) is an all-boys post primary  school with an enrolment of 907 pupils for the 2021/22 school year.  A  project to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils has been devolved to the school authority for delivery.</p>  <p>  - St  Mary&rsquo;s High School, Midleton (62380M) is an all girls&rsquo; post primary school with an enrolment of 758 pupils for the 2021/2022 school year. In respect of the 2022/23 academic year, the Department is working closely with CEIST as patron of St. Mary&rsquo;s High School, Midleton, to deliver interim accommodation at this school and facilitate provision of the required school places. The Department continues to engage with the school patron in respect of a project for a new school building for St. Mary&rsquo;s High school to cater for 1,000 pupils.</p>  <p>  - Pobailscoil na Trion&oacute;ide, Youghal, (91513S) is a co-educational post primary school with an enrolment of 1005 pupils for the 2021/2022 school year. A project to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,200 pupils has been devolved to the school authority for delivery. Interim accommodation was approved for the 2021/22 school year to facilitate school expansion (6 classroom units)</p>  <p>  - Col&aacute;iste Mhuire, Cobh (62180E) is a co-educational school which had an enrolment of 702 pupils for the 2021/2022 school year. A devolved grant has been approved to the school to facilitate its expansion.</p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to engage with all patrons of schools in the area referred to in order to identify any additional required interim solutions to meet the need for post primary places. My Department will continue its focus on advancing these and other projects in East Cork and to ensure sufficient mainstream and SEN school places at both primary and post primary level.</p></reply>

The provision of outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts form part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings. These facilities may also be provided where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school.  </p>  <p>  The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics particularly at post-primary level and for special education needs provision.  The Deputy will appreciate that the immediate priority of my Department is providing new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.</p>  <p>  However, the latter stages of the National Development Plan will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.  This will include a PE Hall build and modernisation programme to ensure that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision. The ancillary accommodation needs of primary schools, such as General Purpose rooms will also be considered.</p>  <p>  The current status of approved projects under the school building programme is listed on a county by county basis on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and is regularly updated to reflect progress through the various project stages. This includes both large-scale projects and projects in receipt of devolved funding under the Additional Accommodation Scheme. </p></reply>

The personal progression plan typically contains a schedule of activities, actions and job-focused targets, taking into account the person&rsquo;s specific employment preferences. </p>  <p>  Jobseekers are asked to sign the personal progression plan as an indication of their agreement to carry out the actions contained in the document.  They are not obliged to sign but their agreement is noted.  </p>  <p>  All jobseekers are required, under legislation, to fully engage with the employment support service in this and all other respects.  The personal progression plan is a crucial element of each jobseeker&rsquo;s engagement with any of the Department&rsquo;s employment services and generally will be a document that will be reviewed throughout the person&rsquo;s engagement period as they develop employment related skills and competencies or job related experience from short periods of employment.</p>  <p>  Personal Advisors work with clients on their barriers to employment to ensure that when a suitable employment opportunity presents itself that they have a potential solution in place.  When a person is considering applying for a particular position, the Personal Advisor where appropriate will discuss the financial implications of returning to work and advice is given on other entitlements that may be available to the client.  The Personal Advisor&rsquo;s role in this process is to provide advice and support to the client helping them to come to a decision on whether the position is suitable and sustainable.  It is the client themselves that make that final decision.</p>  <p>  While the referral of clients to the JobPath service will cease at the end of June 2022, there will be a run-off period to enable existing clients to complete their engagement.</p></reply>

Means tested payments are subject to periodic means reviews.  </p>  <p>  Following a recent review of their entitlement the person concerned was assessed with means of &euro;164.05 per week, which is derived from her spouse&rsquo;s employment income and capital from savings.

The purpose of this payment is to assist qualifying households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The provision of any additional supports such as extending the Fuel Allowance season would have cost implications and could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of supports, energy efficiency awareness initiatives and investment in programmes to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock.</p>  <p>  As part of the measures included in the National Energy Security Framework, Government has decided that a further additional lump sum payment of &euro;100 will be paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance in the last week of the Fuel Allowance season &ndash; a payment equivalent to over 3 weeks additional Fuel Allowance.  This payment will be provided in mid-May, after necessary IT changes have been implemented in my Department to effect the payment.</p>  <p>  This means that low-income households will see an increase of 55% in Fuel Allowance support provided during this fuel allowance season compared to last season.  A recipient household which would have received &euro;735 in fuel season 2020/2021 would see an increase of &euro;404 to &euro;1,139 in fuel allowance payments in fuel season 2021/2022.  When taken in conjunction with the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, due to be paid in April, this household would have received over &euro;600 in additional targeted Government supports over the course of this fuel season.  &euro;600 is the equivalent of over 18 weeks' additional Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides discretionary exceptional needs payments, where appropriate, to people who face difficulties in meeting fuel bills.  These payments are not ring-fenced or budget limited as they would be if they were drawn from an earmarked fund, but rather are demand led.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The funding for the programme amounted to around &euro;16 million and was provided jointly under the European Union&rsquo;s ESF 2014-2020 Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning Operational Programme and the Irish Exchequer. </p>  <p>  Last year, I put a plan in place to allow for the transition of providers and participants to new arrangements and this was agreed with the Ability Providers Subgroup.  This included a two-month extension to the 26 organisations still operating under the programme at that time.  The Ability Programme concluded at the end of August 2021.</p>  <p>  On 30 July last year I announced a new employment support measure for people with disabilities under Dormant Accounts Funding (DAF).  The DAF Measures to Support the Employment of People with Disabilities programme began in September and runs up to the end of 2022.  45 projects have been funded up to an amount of &euro;7.6 million.  All 27 organisations who received funding under the former Ability Programme were successful in securing funding under this measure. </p>  <p>  A new employment programme for people with disabilities will be included in the measures under a new Operational Programme for Ireland under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) 2021-2027.  The new disability focused employment measure will build on the learnings from the former Ability Programme. </p>  <p>  The ESF Managing Authority in Ireland - based in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science - is currently compiling the Operational Programme which will be submitted for Government Approval in the summer, prior to formal submission to the European Commission.  It is expected that Commission approval will be communicated in the latter part of the year.  </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the new disability programme will be open in 2023 to applications from organisations across the country including the 27 former Ability Programme organisations.</p></reply>

It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and the personal rate of payment is not means tested.  Expenditure on Invalidity Pension amounted to approximately &euro;730 million in 2021.</p>  <p>  A qualifying condition for Invalidity Pension is that a claimant must be regarded as being permanently incapable of work.  For this reason, people on this payment are not expected to return to the workplace.</p>  <p>  However, permission may be granted to do rehabilitative or voluntary work while in receipt of Invalidity Pension.  This might apply if the person in question intends to help out at a farm occasionally with no payment in return.  Written permission must be obtained first from the Invalidity Pension section prior to starting such voluntary work.  Permission is granted on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  If the person in question intends take up paid employment or self-employment, they will need to transfer to Partial Capacity Benefit.  The Department will carry out a medical assessment to review their level of incapacity as moderate, severe and profound.  The corresponding levels of payment are &euro;104, &euro;156 and &euro;208 respectively.  People can earn any amount and work as many hours as they wish.  People may not take up work until they have received written approval from the Department.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As at the end of February there were in excess of 155,000 people in receipt of this payment.  </p><p>The personal weekly rate increased in January to &euro;208 per week.  Increases are applied where there is a  qualified adult (&euro;138) or where there are qualified children (&euro;48/&euro;40, depending on the age of the child).  Persons in receipt of Disability Allowance are also entitled to a Free Travel Scheme pass and may be entitled to additional secondary benefits such as the Household Benefits Package.</p><p>Through the Budget process, a number of measures were introduced to support people with disabilities and carers, as follows:</p><p>1. Increases to the weekly rates of payment for working age recipients (under 66 years of age) by &euro;5 per week, with proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates;</p><p>2. Increase to the income disregard for Carer's Allowance from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for a couple;</p><p>3. Increase to the Capital Disregard for Carer's  Allowance from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000; </p><p>4. Extension to period during which Domiciliary Care Allowance can be paid for children in hospital from three months to six months (including payment of carer's allowance for this period);</p><p>5. Increase to the upper earnings disregard limit for Disability Allowance from  &euro;350 to &euro;375 per week;</p><p>6. Increase in the rate of Wage Subsidy Scheme for people with disabilities by &euro;1 per hour (equivalent to 60% of National Minimum Wage);</p><p>7. Three grants, currently available through Intreo centres, o also be available through EmployAbility contractors in 2022;</p><p>8. Increase to the general weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance to &euro;7.60 (Currently &euro;2.50 per week);</p><p>9. Extension to the eligibility for the disregard of PhD scholarship income, in the means test, to recipients of Blind Pension;</p><p>10. Introduction of a grant of up to &euro;500 in any calendar year towards the purchase of wigs/hairpieces/hair replacement system in cases of hair loss due to illness or treatment of an illness;</p><p>11. Increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;5 to &euro;33 per week. The weekly means threshold was also  increased by &euro;20 from &euro;100 to &euro;120; </p><p>12. Increase to the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;3, from &euro;19 to &euro;22 per week. </p><p>My Department also provides the Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) scheme for those whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  This scheme includes Exceptional Needs Payments, Urgent Needs Payments and SWA Supplements (heat, travel and dietary supplements).  These means tested payments may be made to help meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income. </p><p>In addition to the above, my Department commissioned Indecon International Research Economists to carry out research into the cost of disability in Ireland and the Government published their report in December.  Additional costs of disability identified run across a number of areas of expenditure including housing; equipment, aids and appliances; mobility, transport and communications; medicines; care and assistance services and additional living expenses.  The Government has referred the report to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, which is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, Anne Rabbitte, TD.</p><p>My Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives, while any proposed changes have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

Invalidity Pension is paid to people who are &ldquo;permanently incapable of work&rdquo; because of illness or disability.  It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and is not means tested.  Increases are paid where there are adult or child dependants.  People in receipt of Invalidity Pension are also entitled to a Free Travel Scheme pass.  They may also be entitled to additional secondary benefits such as the Household Benefits Package.</p>  <p>  A person who has an insufficient PRSI contribution record to qualify for a social insurance scheme, may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme.  Disability Allowance is a means-tested payment for people with a disability.  Eligibility for the scheme includes the requirement that the disability must be expected to last for at least one year, and substantially restrict a person&rsquo;s ability to work.  Increases are paid where there are adult or child dependants.  People in receipt of Disability Allowance are also entitled to a Free Travel Scheme pass.  They may also be entitled to additional secondary benefits such as the Household Benefits Package.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) was brought in as a short-term measure and is not a long-term income support payment.

Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.  </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance acts as an income support for those who cannot earn adequate income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most. </p>  <p>  While the caring requirements of carees may be different, this does not affect the rates of the allowance, which is intended to provide an income support for the carer and does not depend on individual care requirements.    </p>  <p>  By its nature, the means test takes account of the income a person or couple has in terms of cash and capital.  It does not take account of a person&rsquo;s expenditure.  In line with most social assistance payments, deductions, such as PRSI, are permitted for Carer's Allowance.</p>  <p>  The current income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system.  The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple.  From June the weekly income disregard for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will increase to &euro;350 a week for single carers and to &euro;750 for carers with a spouse/partner.</p>  <p>  If net rather than gross income was assessed for Carer's Allowance, it would mean that changes in tax rates or tax reliefs could change the claimant&rsquo;s rate of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  This proposed change would also have significant budgetary implications and would give rise to inconsistencies in how means tests are applied across schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department has not carried out a budgetary analysis along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  The Home Support Service (formerly called the Home Help Service or Home Care Package Scheme) referred to is administered by the HSE and is  a matter for the Minister of Health.  This scheme aims to support older people to remain in their own homes and provides the older person with support for everyday tasks.  As such the scheme is fundamentally different in its nature and purpose when compared to the Carer's Allowance payment provided by my Department. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am keenly aware of the key role that family carers play in Irish society and the challenges they face.  I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers under review.  However, any improvements or additions to the current supports provided by my Department &ndash; such as introducing further changes to the means testing of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance - would have implications for overall spending and could only be addressed in an overall budgetary and policy context.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist qualifying households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  Taking account of the fact that the fuel allowance is a household based payment and that qualification is not just based on the means test but on a number of other complex qualifying criteria such as household composition, it is not possible for my Department to provide an accurate projection of the potential cost of the measure outlined by the Deputies or the additional number of persons who would qualify for the fuel allowance payment.  </p>  <p>  Qualifying payments for Fuel Allowance are those payments that are considered long term payments and an applicant must also satisfy a means test.  People on long term payments are unlikely to have additional resources of their own and are more vulnerable to poverty, including energy poverty.  It is for this reason that the Department allocates additional payments, supports and resources to help this cohort of claimants.</p>  <p>  In the majority of cases, Illness Benefit is a short-term payment for those who are certified by their GP as needing to take time out from their employment due to illness, and accordingly is not a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  People who are permanently incapable of work may be eligible for the non-means-tested Invalidity Pension, subject to satisfying the relevant social insurance and medical criteria.  Those who are substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment arising from a medical condition may be eligible for the means-tested Disability Allowance, subject to meeting the relevant medical criteria.  Recipients of both of these payments, subject to satisfying all qualifying conditions, may be eligible for Fuel Allowance.</p>  <p>  Any decision to allow those in receipt of a short-term payment such as Illness Benefit to receive the fuel allowance payment would represent a fundamental change to the nature of the scheme and would inevitably lead to pressure for other short-term schemes to be considered as qualifying payments for the Fuel Allowance.  As such, it would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost, which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

0818-800024 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p><p><b>Table 1 - The number by category of ENPs and UNPs paid in October/ November/December 2021, and January/February/March 2022.</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Category </th>       <th>October 2021</th>       <th>November 2021</th>       <th>December 2021</th>       <th>January 2022</th>       <th>February 2022</th>       <th>March 2022</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bills </td>       <td>124 </td>       <td>147 </td>       <td>106 </td>       <td>125 </td>       <td>148 </td>       <td>197 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Child Related</td>       <td>161 </td>       <td>193 </td>       <td>129 </td>       <td>128 </td>       <td>170 </td>       <td>172 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clothing </td>       <td>865 </td>       <td>975 </td>       <td>809 </td>       <td>531 </td>       <td>630 </td>       <td>1,280 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Funeral </td>       <td>202 </td>       <td>222 </td>       <td>137 </td>       <td>193 </td>       <td>252 </td>       <td>238 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General </td>       <td>1,213 </td>       <td>1,298 </td>       <td>1,351 </td>       <td>938 </td>       <td>1,086 </td>       <td>1,510 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Housing </td>       <td>2,009 </td>       <td>2,117 </td>       <td>1,844 </td>       <td>1,557 </td>       <td>1,834 </td>       <td>1,781 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Illness </td>       <td>102 </td>       <td>115 </td>       <td>75 </td>       <td>94 </td>       <td>104 </td>       <td>103 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Urgent needs payment  </td>       <td>24 </td>       <td>36 </td>       <td>38 </td>       <td>26 </td>       <td>25 </td>       <td>45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>4,700 </td>       <td>5,103 </td>       <td>4,489 </td>       <td>3,592 </td>       <td>4,249 </td>       <td>5,326 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2 - The total expenditure by category of ENPs and UNPs paid in October/ November/December 2021, and January/February/March 2022.</b></p><p><b>Note: </b>These figures are taken from the Department's ENP/UNP database and represent a snapshot of ENPs/UNPs as they are approved by an officer rather than when they are paid.  The figures do not capture payments that are cancelled, payments that go out of date or overpayments recouped.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Category </th>       <th>October 2021</th>       <th>November 2021</th>       <th>December 2021</th>       <th>January 2022</th>       <th>February 2022</th>       <th>March 2022</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bills </td>       <td>&euro;77,283 </td>       <td>&euro;112,727 </td>       <td>&euro;64,757 </td>       <td>&euro;79,198 </td>       <td>&euro;79,721 </td>       <td>&euro;99,643 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Child Related</td>       <td>&euro;26,622 </td>       <td>&euro;31,373 </td>       <td>&euro;21,230 </td>       <td>&euro;18,670 </td>       <td>&euro;26,220 </td>       <td>&euro;26,369 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clothing </td>       <td>&euro;104,760 </td>       <td>&euro;117,494 </td>       <td>&euro;103,877 </td>       <td>&euro;62,247 </td>       <td>&euro;74,844 </td>       <td>&euro;164,728 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Funeral </td>       <td>&euro;432,183 </td>       <td>&euro;444,204 </td>       <td>&euro;312,845 </td>       <td>&euro;421,974 </td>       <td>&euro;576,924 </td>       <td>&euro;571,588 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>General </td>       <td>&euro;272,448 </td>       <td>&euro;290,335 </td>       <td>&euro;327,786 </td>       <td>&euro;202,818 </td>       <td>&euro;224,198 </td>       <td>&euro;338,760 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Housing </td>       <td>&euro;2,319,620 </td>       <td>&euro;2,600,017 </td>       <td>&euro;2,387,573 </td>       <td>&euro;2,019,290 </td>       <td>&euro;2,317,537 </td>       <td>&euro;2,386,875 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Illness </td>       <td>&euro;13,560 </td>       <td>&euro;19,440 </td>       <td>&euro;13,883 </td>       <td>&euro;14,431 </td>       <td>&euro;16,325 </td>       <td>&euro;16,759 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Urgent Needs Payment</td>       <td>&euro;11,053 </td>       <td>&euro;21,913 </td>       <td>&euro;36,016 </td>       <td>&euro;9,066 </td>       <td>&euro;26,693 </td>       <td>&euro;38,115 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>&euro;3,257,529</td>       <td>&euro;3,637,503</td>       <td>&euro;3,267,967</td>       <td>&euro;2,827,694</td>       <td>&euro;3,342,462</td>       <td>&euro;3,642,837</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 3 -

In 2021, the Low Pay Commission was requested to examine the Programme for Government commitment to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government and to make recommendations on the best approach.  </p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently received the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations on the progression to a living wage and is currently reviewing the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations.   Therefore, at this stage it is not possible to provide an estimate of the cost of moving any specific group of workers, such as JI participants, to a living wage.  </p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices.  To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government have recently introduced additional expenditure measures to a total of &euro;505 million. </p>  <p>  The Department acknowledges the valuable and dedicated service that JI team leaders and JI participants provide in delivering local based community services. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputies. </p></reply>

Limerick for January to March 2022.</p><p>Table 1 shows the number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients in Co. Limerick at end of January, February, and March 2022.</p><p>Table 2 shows the number and total expenditure for ENPs and UNPs paid in Co. Limerick for</p><p>January, February, and March 2022.</p><p>Table 3 shows the number of review requests received and the outcomes for ENPs in Co. Limerick for January, February, and March 2022. </p><p>I would encourage any person, including persons on low incomes, who consider that they may have an entitlement to a payment under the SWA scheme to contact the Community Welfare Service at their local Intreo Centre.  There is a national Income Support Helpline in place - 0818-800024 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Table 1 - The number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients in Co.

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is the new funding stream to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.</p>  <p>  Core Funding will operate alongside the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme and constitute additional income for providers on top of funding for these schemes, as well as income from parental fees.</p>  <p>  One of the key conditions of Core Funding will be the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels. This will ensure that parents feel the full affordability effects of the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme. Core Funding will also include conditions in relation to quality improvements in services and transparency in relation to operations.</p>  <p>  Extensive information has been communicated to the sector, including detail on the way in which Core Funding will be allocated to individual services. A Ready Reckoner calculator has also been launched to assist providers in estimating the impact of Core Funding for their individual service.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is distributed in a fair and reasonable manner that is related to services&rsquo; costs of delivery. Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly. No service will lose out.</p>  <p>  I have issued a funding guarantee to ensure that no service will receive less in Core Funding that it previously received in higher capitation and programme support payments, if their circumstances remain the same. An estimated 1% of services will be caught by the funding guarantee. All other services will see increases in funding, and most substantial increases in funding.  Those services that are affected by the funding guarantee are those that are in receipt of the highest levels of public funding - between &euro;110 and &euro;120 per hour of provision with two staff required to be employed.</p>  <p>  City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) have received training in order to assist providers in calculating their potential Core Funding allocations. I would encourage providers to contact their local CCC for guidance and support in understanding the impacts and benefits of Core Funding for their service. Contact details for CCCs are available at myccc.ie/where-is-my-nearest-ccc and providers can reach out for support at any time. </p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that Core Funding will intentionally address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022. This sees the funding for the employment of graduates more fairly distributed across the ELC system.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening for longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher. The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed in this way based on a service's capacity. This &euro;183 million includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million). It is important to note that sick pay, and other employer costs, are factored in to the estimated staff costs allocation in Core Funding. In addition, a further &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  The precise implications of the funding for staff pay and conditions depends on the agreement of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) by the Joint Labour Committee (JLC). However, the level of funding provided is significant enough to achieve a substantial improvement in levels of staff pay for the sector as a whole as well as the development of career frameworks. If an ERO is agreed, where services are already paying above the ERO rate there will not be a requirement to increase rates of pay. Improved terms and conditions, opportunities for progression and greater rates of staff retention are important steps to improving quality in the sector.</p>  <p>  In response to queries received by my Department on a number of matters, including many of those highlighted in the correspondence detailed, such as the impact of Core Funding on smaller Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) services, additional information relating to Core Funding is now available at first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/core-funding.  </p>  <p>  The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall. This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.</p></reply>

They are also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for the free preschool programme (ECCE). This subsidy is not means tested and provides 50c per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for a maximum of 45 hours per week.</p><p>- Income Assessed Subsidies are available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. This subsidy is means tested and will be calculated based on your individual circumstances. Your rate will vary depending on your level of family income, your child&rsquo;s age and educational stage, and the number of children in your family.</p><p>Budget 2022 announced a number of changes to the NCS which will be rolled out this year. The first change will remove the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours, benefiting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families. The second change will extend the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefiting up to 40,000 children. Full year estimates of these changes have been factored into the costs below but the impact of these changes will not be fully known until Q.4 2022.</p><p>The estimated costs based on the scenarios presented are derived from current levels of usage and expenditure and informed by SWITCH, the ESRI tax-benefit model. These individual estimates are based on no behavioural change and should be interpreted with caution. It should be noted that changes to subsidies may result in changes to patterns and levels of usage by families. These changes are likely to be more pronounced at higher rates of increase. </p><p>In addition, although the question refers to children under 3 years old, as noted above from September 2022 universal will available for children under 15 and the costs have been assessed on an under-15 basis</p><p>Based on the above, the follow estimated costs have been extrapolated and rounded:</p><p>Cost of increasing the universal subsidy for children  by each of the amounts:</p><p>- 50 cent  - &euro;50 million</p><p>- &euro;1 - &euro;105 million</p><p>- &euro;2 - &euro;210 million</p><p>- &euro;5 - &euro;480 million</p><p>Cost of increasing each of the NCS rates by: </p><p>- &euro;1 - &euro;145 million</p><p>- &euro;2 - &euro;290 million</p><p>- &euro;5 - &euro;730 million</p><p>- &euro;10 - &euro;1.45 billion</p><p>Cost and the estimated number of families who would benefit from increasing the maximum reckonable family income of &euro;60,000 under the national childcare scheme by: </p><p>- &euro;2,500 - &euro;6 million benefiting approximately 4,500 children</p><p>- &euro;5,000 - &euro;12 million benefiting approximately 5,200 children</p><p>- &euro;10,000 - &euro;24 million benefiting approximately 12,500 children.</p></reply>

To achieve this, there is a need for greater State investment and greater public management of provision.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is the new funding stream to start this partnership for the public good between the State and providers. Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.</p>  <p>  Core Funding will operate alongside the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme and constitute additional income for providers on top of funding for these schemes, as well as income from parental fees.</p>  <p>  One of the key conditions of Core Funding will be the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels. This will ensure that parents feel the full affordability effects of the National Childcare Scheme and the ECCE programme. Core Funding will also include conditions in relation to quality improvements in services and transparency in relation to operations.</p>  <p>  Extensive information has been communicated to the sector, including detail on the way in which Core Funding will be allocated to individual services. A Ready Reckoner calculator has also been launched to assist providers in estimating the impact of Core Funding for their individual service.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is distributed in a fair and reasonable manner that is related to services&rsquo; costs of delivery. Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly. No service will lose out.</p>  <p>  I have issued a funding guarantee to ensure that no service will receive less in Core Funding than it previously received in higher capitation and programme support payments, if their circumstances remain the same. An estimated 1% of services will be caught by the funding guarantee. All other services will see increases in funding, and most substantial increases in funding.  The services that are affected by the funding guarantee are those that are currently in receipt of the highest levels of public funding compared to the required staffing complement - between &euro;110 and &euro;120 per hour with two staff required.</p>  <p>  City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) have received training in order to assist providers in calculating their potential Core Funding allocations. I would encourage providers to contact their local CCC for guidance and support in understanding the impacts and benefits of Core Funding for their service. Contact details for CCCs are available at myccc.ie/where-is-my-nearest-ccc and providers can reach out for support at any time. </p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that Core Funding will intentionally address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022. This sees the funding for the employment of graduate staff more fairly distributed across the ELC system.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening for longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher. The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed in this way based on a service's capacity. This &euro;183 million includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million). It is important to note that sick pay, and other employer costs, are factored in to the estimated staff costs allocation in Core Funding. In addition, a further &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  Places do not have to be filled in order for Core Funding to be allocated. However, for capacity to be funded, the necessary levels of staff must be in place. The staffing required depends on the age group and session types of the places available. The capacity of a service is also limited by the regulatory space requirements.</p>  <p>  In response to queries received by my Department on a number of matters, including those highlighted in the correspondence detailed, such as the impact of Core Funding on smaller Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) services, additional information relating to Core Funding is now available at first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/core-funding.  </p>  <p>  The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall. This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding. Core Funding however is optional for providers.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working together in partnership with providers to deliver ELC and SAC services for the public good.</p></reply>

This will allow the Decision Support Service to become fully operational and provide the progressive services and supports of the 2015 Act.</p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (the 2015 Act) is an important piece of legislation that represents significant legal reform. It changes the existing law on capacity from the status approach of the wardship system to a flexible functional approach, whereby capacity is assessed on an issue and time-specific basis.  </p>  <p>  The Act will abolish the wards of court system for adults by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871. Adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements on a phased basis over 3 years from the date of commencement.  </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service (DSS), which is the organisation that will operate the provisions of the 2015 Act, will respond to the complex decision-making needs of people with capacity difficulties.  To date, the Decision Support Service has made considerable progress in putting in place the administrative and IT systems needed to operate the 2015 Act.  </p>  <p>  In preparation of becoming fully operational, a budget of &euro;7.3 million was secured for the Decision Support Service in 2022. This represents an increase of &euro;1.5 million compared to 2021 and a doubling of financial resources since the transfer of functions to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in 2020. </p>  <p>  Amendments are required to the 2015 Act before full commencement can take place.  Work has been ongoing on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, which will be published in the near future and which I look forward to taking through the Houses. The amendments will streamline processes, in the interests of those using its provisions.  They will also strengthen the safeguards included in the 2015 Act. </p></reply>

Contact details for CCCs are available at myccc.ie/where-is-my-nearest-ccc and providers can reach out for support at any time. </p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that Core Funding will intentionally address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision as well as graduate Managers. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022. This sees public funding for the employment of graduates in ELC more fairly distributed across the system .</p>  <p>  Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening for longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher. The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed in this way based on a service's capacity. This &euro;183 million includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million). It is important to note that sick pay, and other employer costs, are factored in to the estimated staff costs allocation in Core Funding. In addition, a further &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  In December 2021, I also launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. </p>  <p>  Nurturing Skills commits to the provision of part-funded places on flexible education programmes at levels 6 to 8 for Early Years Educators working in the sector. Plans for the new funding scheme are currently being developed. This new funding will support upskilling and strengthen career development pathways for those working in the sector, reducing the cost to educators of undertaking further and higher education qualifications. The new funding will also develop and introduce mechanisms for providing financial support to services to help meet the costs of releasing staff to go on student practice placements and study leave.</p>  <p>  In response to queries received by my Department on a number of matters, including many of those highlighted in the correspondence detailed, such as the impact of Core Funding on smaller Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) services, additional information relating to Core Funding is now available at first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/core-funding.  </p>  <p>  The new funding model being implemented aims to transform the sector to one that is increasingly publicly funded and publicly managed, delivering a service for the public good, through a partnership between the State and providers, to the benefit of children, parents, practitioners, and society overall. This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides. Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding. It is my ambition that the maximum number providers choose to participate in this partnership to deliver ELC and SAC for the public good and come into contract for Core Funding.

Recognising the critical role of mobility as a precursor for real independence, I chair a Working Group under Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy. This Action states that: </p>  <p>  "We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a</p>  <p>  coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.". </p>  <p>  The nature of that work is to analyse the range of schemes and programmes across the State and examine whether or not they  function in a coherent manner that properly supports people with disabilities, and to formulate proposals for coordinated improvement. Individual departments and agencies continue to hold primary responsibility for their own statutory schemes and funded programmes in this context.</p>  <p>  The Working Group is comprised of representatives of relevant departments, agencies and stakeholders, including members of the Disability Stakeholders Group, experts by experience, and Disabled Persons Organisations. At its January meeting the Group agreed to conduct a "stock taking" exercise to assess the current state of transport supports. </p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the operation of the Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme is the responsibility of the Minister of Finance, who established that Scheme by Statutory Instrument under the provisions of the Finance Acts. These regulations include the criteria for primary medical certificates, and any alteration to same would ultimately be a matter for the Minister for Finance to pursue via Statutory Instrument.</p></reply>

Last month, I secured Government approval for the draft Heads of Bill for the Payment Scheme and for the referral of these draft Heads of Bill to the Office of Parliamentary Council for drafting. I have sought priority drafting of the Bill to ensure that it can be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible. I have also referred the draft Heads of Bill to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for pre-legislative scrutiny, again requesting their assistance in meeting the urgent need to deliver this Scheme for survivors as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Once the legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas and the administrative infrastructure required to deliver the Scheme has been established, the Scheme will be open for applications for both financial awards and enhanced medical cards. I hope that this will be possible by the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  A person will be eligible for an enhanced medical card if they were resident in a relevant institution for 6 months or more. </p></reply>

Recognising their central importance for the quality of provision, Nurturing Skills aims to support the professional development of the workforce and raise the profile of careers in the sector.</p></reply>

Since the commencement of the war on Ukraine on 25th February, 116 separated children from Ukraine have been referred to Tusla. Of these, 59 were received into care/accommodation. There are currently 44 separated children from Ukraine in Tusla's care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the supports and help available to SCSIP, Tusla has a dedicated social work team.

In the first instance, Tusla makes every attempt to contact relatives of the child and to reunite the child with family members. If children cannot be reunified with family, they are received into the care of Tusla.</p>  <p>  These children are placed by Tusla either in small specialist residential care centres, or with specifically recruited foster families under a F&aacute;ilte Foster care programme. The children are automatically entitled as children in care to a medical card and access to education services. </p>  <p>  In addition, a Social Worker is allocated to them to develop a care plan and monitor the progress of the child / young persons care. The care plan may involve specialist English language tuition, intensive educational supports and therapeutic work in respect of trauma.</p>  <p>  The basis for care of a SCSIP is different from the general child in care population; as they are received into care for protection and welfare reasons due to their separation from their primary carers, which can be as a consequence of war or persecution.  Children who arrive in Ireland outside of a dedicated refugee programme are supported in their application for refugee status. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is seeking information on the a breakdown of SCSIP who live outside the direct provision system by electoral area, as this is an operational matter for Tusla I have referred the matter to Tusla, and asked that a direct response be provided to the Deputy.</p></reply>

This Action states that: </p>  <p>  "We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a</p>  <p>  coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.". </p>  <p>  The nature of that work is to analyse the range of schemes and programmes across the State and examine whether or not they  function in a coherent manner that properly supports people with disabilities, and to formulate proposals for coordinated improvement. Individual departments and agencies continue to hold primary responsibility for their own statutory schemes and funded programmes in this context.</p>  <p>  The Working Group is comprised of representatives of relevant departments, agencies and stakeholders, including members of the Disability Stakeholders Group, experts by experience, and Disabled Persons Organisations. At its January meeting the Group agreed to conduct a "stock taking" exercise to assess the current state of transport supports. </p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the operation of the Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme is the responsibility of the Minister of Finance, who established that Scheme by Statutory Instrument under the provisions of the Finance Acts. These regulations include the criteria for primary medical certificates, and any alteration to same would ultimately be a matter for the Minister for Finance to pursue via Statutory Instrument.</p></reply>

They have informed us that Tusla, the Child &amp;amp; Family Agency is committed to ensuring that all children and young people who can no longer live with their parents or guardian at a particular time, are provided with a safe alternative care placement. </p>  <p>  Tusla advised that the number of children in state care in hotel accommodation, each month varies for a number of reasons, some of which are multi-factorial in nature. Examples include a break-down in placements; lack of suitable placements; complexity of the young person&rsquo;s needs, including psychological or mental health issues; criminality; substance abuse or concerns for their safety. As the operating environment for such placements is dynamic, and numbers fluctuate on a daily basis, on average between 9-11 young people are referred for such emergency placements per month. </p>  <p>  Tusla further stated that such placements are considered short-term, transitional and exceptional. By way of example, in 2021, Tusla received 72,762 referrals. At the end of January 2022 there were 5,850 children in care.  Of the children in care, 90% are in Foster Care, 8% are in residential care and the remaining 2% are in &ldquo;other&rdquo; care placements, including supported lodgings, at home under a care order, other residential centres (e.g., disability) or a detention centre. </p>  <p>  Tusla further advised that it is currently developing an Alternative Care Strategic Plan to ensure that it continues to improve services for children, young people and their families. The Alternative Care Strategy incorporates a specific plan for Residential Care Services, Foster Care and Aftercare. </p>  <p>  The Report on the Residential Care Strategic Plan 2022-25 was approved by the Tusla Board on 25th March.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-26a.2994.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600109#WRDDD03000"><p>The Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) Regulations, 1995 and the Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995, stipulates that the allowance payable to foster carers and relatives shall not be less than an amount specified by the Minister.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance was last increased on January 1st 2009. Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.</p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision. The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently preparing a paper on this matter, which will then be considered by my Department.</p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and the provisions in relation foster care will form part of this review.</p></reply>

The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager. Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.</p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care. This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision. The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently preparing a paper on this matter, which will then be considered by my Department.</p>  <p>  The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate. However, the Department is undertaking an extensive review of the Child Care Act 1991 and the provisions in relation to foster care will form part of this review.</p></reply>

More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p>  <p>  To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme. </p>  <p>  Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain areas, and in certain age groups.</p>  <p>  Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21%. </p>  <p>  As part of ongoing efforts by my Department to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, Pobal, using the data captured as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey in June 2021 and current registration data, recently projected national vacancy rates in February 2022. These projections revealed an estimated fall in national vacancy rates from June 2021 to February 2022 &ndash; with vacancy rates projected to have fallen from 21% to 19%. </p>  <p>  Pobal has commenced the new data collection as of 4 April 2022, as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey. This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established.</p>  <p>  In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, CCC are currently proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to identify unused capacity and explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of unmet early learning and childcare needs of families.</p>  <p>  Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided with accommodation under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.</p>  <p>  Where children are homeless as part of a family experiencing homelessness, Tusla works with other statutory and voluntary agencies to mitigate the challenges faced by these parents and children. Such actions taken by Tusla include the provision of funding for child support workers. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that Tusla only intervenes in family life in exceptional circumstances. Children who are with their families in emergency accommodation remain in the care of their parents or guardians. Where Tusla has concerns regarding the welfare and development of any child they will provide family supports to assist that family and child.</p>  <p>  While the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has ultimate responsibility for managing homelessness, my Department is committed to addressing homelessness as part of a whole-of-Government response including contributing to the development of a Youth Homeless Strategy.  My Department is leading and co-ordinating consultations with representatives of young people experiencing homelessness and most at risk of homelessness so that their voices are heard and their needs properly reflected in the action plan developed as part of the strategy.</p>  <p>  The findings of the  consultation with young people experiencing homelessness will additionally inform the development of the successor framework to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures which is currently being developed by my Department.</p></reply>

In addition, the fee grant income threshold increased from &euro;31,500 to &euro;54,240 from September 2021. </p>  <p>  The changes I made in Budget 2022, will mean that from the next academic year:-</p>  <p>  - All student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, will increase by &euro;200 per year. </p>  <p>  - The income thresholds to  qualify for the standard rate of student grant will increase by &euro;1,000. </p>  <p>  - The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km.</p>  <p>  I have prioritised these changes for the 2022/23 academic year and they will benefit thousands of students, building on the improvements that have already been made for postgraduate students through this year&rsquo;s student grant scheme. </p></reply>

This service compares foreign qualifications to major award types and levels on the Irish National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) which sets these foreign qualifications clearly into an Irish context.  QQI&rsquo;s NARIC database currently lists 18 Ukrainian qualifications, comparable to levels 3-10 on the NFQ, which includes general professional, further and higher education qualifications. NARIC Ireland is working with the NARIC network across Europe to continue building the list of Ukrainian qualifications as a matter of  priority. The service provided by NARIC Ireland helps to inform employers to determine if an applicant holds the academic qualifications necessary for a particular job or employment opportunity. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, a guide to NARIC has recently been translated into Ukrainian and other languages which are spoken by Ukrainians. </p>  <p>  SOLAS operates the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) process for tradespeople, as well as Recognition of Qualifications on relevant construction safety certification. In relation to Ukrainian applicants specifically, Ukrainian interpreters are being used as required, to enable individuals to access services so that they can have their qualifications recognised and engage in courses. Separately, SOLAS has scheduled the first of two Ukrainian Safe Pass programmes. As with the general approach already noted, the services of an approved Ukrainian interpreter are being used to assist with the delivery. Whilst presently, the RPL and RPQ systems are working as designed SOLAS will increase its monitoring of applications and any issues arising. In this approach, SOLAS is operating in line with QQI guidance.</p>  <p>  Where a profession is unregulated, there is no formal barrier to prevent someone from continuing to practice their profession in Ireland. However, where a profession is regulated, an individual wishing to continue to practice their profession in Ireland must engage with the relevant Irish competent authority or professional regulator in order to seek the recognition of their qualifications. I would urge any Ukrainian citizen who wishes to practice a regulated profession in Ireland, to engage with the relevant Competent Authority with responsibility for that profession to seek the recognition of their professional qualifications. A list of all of the regulated professions in Ireland, their corresponding competent authority and the relevant contact information for each authority is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/123679/f3dc868b-f95a-42fe-87b3-531983e3bd1f.pdf#page=null.</p>  <p>  My Department has been providing support to the work of our national Competent Authorities by sharing best practice material supplied by the European Commission in relation to the recognition of Ukrainian professional qualifications. In addition, these Competent Authorities have been advised of further information resources which are available to support their work from NARIC Ireland. My Department will continue its work with the European Commission and other Member States in relation to the recognition of professional qualifications of Ukrainian people to ensure an EU-wide appropriate response.</p></reply>

In this regard the student contribution rate requires consideration in the context of a sustainable model of funding for higher education.  </p>  <p>  As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the issue in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly across society.</p></reply>

This includes over 700 final year apprentices who have been fast-tracked to complete their qualification. The backlog is tackled in order of those apprentices who have been waiting longest. Over 700 apprentices who were in the final stages of their apprenticeship were supported to complete an accelerated final phase of workplace training and are now receiving their qualification.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that all apprentices are treated equitably, apprentices will be called in order of longest waiting for their Phase. Officials in my department continue to engage with SOLAS for updates on progress with these waiting lists on behalf of all apprentices including this individual.</p>  <p>  It is expected that the majority of craft apprentices waiting for off-the-job training for phases 4 and 6 on target to be cleared by mid/end-2022.The majority of phase 2 waiting lists is expected to be on target to be cleared by the end of 2022.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this position the Department has been made aware of reports regarding the specific loan scheme for graduate entry medicine and is seeking further information on this issue.</p>  <p>  The fee payable by a student can vary depending on a variety factors including the type of course and the student's access route including previous education. Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes. Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. One of the recommendations of the Fottrell report (2006) was the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme (GEM). Students pursuing graduate entry medicine (GEM) programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA). In academic year 20/21 the state contribution was &euro;11,524 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p>  <p>  Institutions participating in the graduate medical programme have been requested to provide accompanying services and supports to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged students in the programme.</p>  <p>  Students on graduate entry medicine courses may also be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

As autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding, including the funding of their student services, the employment of counselling staff, and the procurement of counselling and mental health services are a matter for the individual institutions.</p><p>In 2021, &euro;5 million was allocated to the higher education institutions to support student mental health and wellbeing. This funding allocated by the HEA included &euro;2m delivered through the Recurrent Grant Model to HEIs, along with an additional &euro;3m secured as part of the 2021 Covid-19 response package.</p><p>HEIs were requested to allocate funds towards student-facing services such as:</p><p>- Recruitment of additional Student Counsellors;</p><p>- Recruitment of additional Assistant Psychologists;</p><p>- Head of service posts for those HEIs employing more than 2 FTEs;</p><p>- Training of HEI staff to enable them to support and refer students to appropriate services;</p><p>- Raising awareness among students of mental health and wellbeing services available, including through student outreach activities;</p><p>- Implementation of the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework; and</p><p>- Implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs; Safe, Respectful, Supportive and Positive: Ending Sexual Harassment in Irish Higher Education Institutions.</p><p>HEIs were advised that the additional funding allocations were intended to enhance rather than displace existing provision of student supports in the areas of mental health and wellbeing. HEIs were also advised to make provision for the sustainability of any supports funded under this allocation.</p><p>The HEA has advised my Department that the impacts of the funding has led to:</p><p>- increased capacity for students to avail of mental health services, especially in the provision of one-to-one sessions, and also, access to psychologists and in some institutions, to psychiatrists;</p><p>- additional and significant provisions offered, including webinars, group sessions, online forums and the development of regular newsletters and e-zines, as well as increased social media presence;</p><p>- innovative outreach events and workshops in the areas of consent, suicide prevention and addictive behaviours;</p><p>- HEIs developing systems and structures for improving services and other activities. For example, in larger institutions, case management and triaging processes have been implemented; and</p><p>- HEI staff being able to avail of training sessions on mental health, thereby, raising the profile internally within HEIs of what services and supports are available for students.</p><p>A number of National Projects have also been implemented with funding provided for Mental Health and Wellbeing. These have produced dedicated tools, focused research and professional collaboration, which will support staff, augment policy-making and the effective targeting of resources across the sector to achieve the high standards set by the respective student well-being, consent and suicide prevention frameworks.</p><p>One such project is the 'Speak Out reporting tool' which was created as part of the implementation of the Framework for Consent, which I launched on 19 October 2021. The tool allows HEIs to understand staff and student experiences of sexual harassment and violence and assists institutions, the HEA and my department in making evidence-based policy decisions in this area. Most importantly, it raises awareness of the supports available to students and staff and encourages them to seek help if they need it.</p><p>In late 2020, I launched the National Student Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Framework. This Framework is Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national approach to address student mental health and suicide prevention. It recognises the many challenges students face, and sets out ways in which institutions can support them and respond through working proactively. The Framework provides clear guidance to higher education institutions regarding implementation of good practices in responding to student mental health difficulties.</p><p>The HEA has established a cross-sectoral &lsquo;Connecting for Life&rsquo; working group to support the implementation of the Framework. This group meets regularly to consider progress on the national framework and will identify examples of good practice for further sharing across the sector.</p><p>My Department will, in consultation with the HEA, consider the future funding needs of mental health services in higher education as part of the next estimates process.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this position the Department has been made aware of reports regarding the specific loan scheme for graduate entry medicine and is seeking further information on this issue.</p>  <p>  The fee payable by a student can vary depending on a variety factors including the type of course and the student's access route including previous education. Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes. Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. One of the recommendations of the Fottrell report (2006) was the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme (GEM). Students pursuing graduate entry medicine (GEM) programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA). In academic year 20/21 the state contribution was &euro;11,524 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p>  <p>  Institutions participating in the graduate medical programme have been requested to provide accompanying services and supports to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged students in the programme.</p>  <p>  Students on graduate entry medicine courses may also be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

It recognises that Skills policy is an area of enormous importance - informing how people in Ireland live, work, learn and thrive.  The development of skills and human capital is an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s long-term plan for a sustainable and inclusive economy that serves the whole of its society including those with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the skills system continues to evolve and remains responsive and agile to the needs of all citizens, the National Economic Recovery Plan included a commitment to review Ireland&rsquo;s skills strategies, architectures and approaches, including the  NSS. In November 2021, I launched the review of the skills strategy and architecture in the shape of an OECD Skills Strategy Project, which will roll out through 2022. The review is rooted in stakeholder engagement and will examine four priority areas:</p>  <p>  1. Securing balance in skills through a responsive and diversified supply of skills;</p>  <p>  2. Fostering greater participation in lifelong learning in and outside of the workplace;</p>  <p>  3. Strengthening the governance across a joined up skills ecosystem; and</p>  <p>  4. Leveraging skills to drive innovation and strengthen the performance of firms.</p>  <p>  The OECD Skills Strategy Project will support a holistic examination of our Skills Strategy and architecture to ensure that Ireland is best equipped to meet current and future skills needs with the imperative that Irish workforce meets the societal demands of all, inclusive of those with disabilities.</p>  <p>  My Department is strongly committed to supporting the health of the population through the provision of graduates with the key competencies and skills to be effective in the health workforce, and support a range of clinical teams in our health services.</p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging with the Department of Health on the number of places available in areas where the HSE has identified significant skills shortages. The areas identified include, but are not limited it, places in health disciplines such as medicine, nursing, health and social care professionals such as Occupational Therapists, Speech and Language therapists, Psychologists, Physiotherapists, Social Workers, Medical Scientists and Dieticians.</p>  <p>  In the short term, my officials are actively engaging with the Higher Education Authority and representatives from the higher education sector on the provision of additional places for the coming academic year, with a focus on areas such as healthcare where there is a need for more skilled graduates. However, there are real, material limits on the immediate increases that can be accommodated on highly practical courses such as healthcare courses which involve clinical placements.</p>  <p>  In the longer term, the Programme for Government commits the Department of Health to working with the education sectors, regulators, and professional bodies to improve the availability of health professionals and reform their training to support integrated care across the entire health service. I will ensure that there is continued engagement with all stakeholders to ensure that we deliver graduates with the skills necessary to support our healthcare system and support the strategic workforce planning by the health sector.</p></reply>

Several of these buildings are shared an operated by the Department of Education and as such my staff in those buildings adhere to Department of Education initiatives on energy saving.</p>  <p>  The Property Management Services in the Office of Public Works, acquired new office space for my Department&rsquo;s Head Quarters at 52 Stephen&rsquo;s Green, Dublin 2 in September 2021. As my Department has only been in occupancy for a short period of time it is not possible to quantify the energy costs associated with the building and associated actions on usage. However, I can state that during enabling works on the building, carried out on behalf of the Office of Public Works, in December 2021 a new energy efficient gas boiler system was commissioned. This is predicted to provide considerable savings and a reduction in energy wastage. Furthermore, building surveys are being carried out on what other measures may be implemented in what is a historic structure. These surveys include the upgrading of windows and improving insulation to prevent heat loss.</p>  <p>  My officials continue to take measures to reduce energy consumption where possible with equipment upgrades and refurbished lighting helping to reduce the energy demand.</p>  <p>  Energy management and performance data for the further and higher education sector is reported annually to the SEAI in order to track the sector&rsquo;s progress. The SEAI in turn publishes an Annual Report setting out the overall energy efficiency performance results of public sector bodies.</p>  <p>  The 2021 Annual Report was based on data relating to 2020 and the report was, therefore, based on sectoral groups as they existed at the outset of 2020. Higher education institutions and Education &amp;amp; Training Boards formed part of the Education and Skills Group. The Education and Skills group performed well, reporting energy savings since baseline of 46%. These savings have been achieved by a combination of behavioural change as a result of energy conservation campaigns and targeted investment in the area of energy upgrade works. There is a strong commitment in the sector to improved energy efficiency and decarbonisation.</p>  <p>  In 2020 my Department partnered with SEAI to commence a Pathfinder Programme in higher education buildings. The purpose of this programme is to establish a pathway for a large-scale building energy retrofit programme to meet the targets set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021. A total of &euro;18 million has been allocated to date, funded 50/50 by my Department and SEAI, and additional funding is currently under consideration. Building on the success of this Pathfinder Programme it is intended to extend the programme imminently to the Further Education and Training sector.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this position the Department has been made aware of reports regarding the specific loan scheme for graduate entry medicine and is seeking further information on this issue.</p>  <p>   The fee payable by a student can vary depending on a variety factors including the type of course and the student's access route including previous education. Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes. Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. One of the recommendations of the Fottrell report (2006) was the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme (GEM). Students pursuing graduate entry medicine (GEM) programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA). In academic year 20/21 the state contribution was &euro;11,524 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p>  <p>   Institutions participating in the graduate medical programme have been requested to provide accompanying services and supports to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged students in the programme.</p>  <p>   Students on graduate entry medicine courses may also be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p>  <p>  Matters relating to the introduction of a scheme to provide for tuition fee funding to students in return for future clinical years in the HSE is matter for the Department of Health.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this position, and to assist the Deputy, officials in my Department referred the query to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) to estimate possible costs. </p>  <p>  The estimated cost, based on full-time EU (including Great Britain &amp;amp; Northern Ireland) Level 8 (honours) degree Nursing students returns compiled by the HEA for the 2020/21 academic year as part of the Student Record System (SRS), to the Irish Exchequer of waiving the student contribution charge or contributing &euro;3,000 of EU tuition fees for all EU nursing students in the state would be in the region of &euro;20m &ndash; &euro;21m. Based on eligible &lsquo;free fees&rsquo; students only, the estimated cost would be in the region of &euro;19m &ndash; &euro;20m. These estimates exclude any subsequent reduction in the student grant budget for SUSI eligible students.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this position the Department has been made aware of reports regarding the specific loan scheme for graduate entry medicine and is seeking further information on this issue.</p>  <p>   The fee payable by a student can vary depending on a variety factors including the type of course and the student's access route including previous education. Entry to medicine in Irish HEIs is provided through both undergraduate and graduate entry routes. Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one of the pathways to study undergraduate medicine. One of the recommendations of the Fottrell report (2006) was the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme (GEM). Students pursuing graduate entry medicine (GEM) programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA). In academic year 20/21 the state contribution was &euro;11,524 per student with the balance of fees payable by the student.</p>  <p>   Institutions participating in the graduate medical programme have been requested to provide accompanying services and supports to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged students in the programme.</p>  <p>   Students on graduate entry medicine courses may also be eligible to apply to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for financial support. The SAF guidelines provide that students with a previous higher education qualification at the same NFQ level, or who, in the past, attended higher education without ultimately obtaining a qualification, may be considered for support on a case-by-case basis and subject to available funding. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>   In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

The further development and mainstreaming of apprenticeship in Ireland through the creation of a single unified apprenticeship system has a key role to play in meeting Ireland's skill needs in a manner which presents a valued proposition for apprentices and employers alike.</p><p>The <i>Action Plan</i>sets a target of 10,000 annual apprentice registrations by 2025. In 2021 there were a record 8,607 registrations- up from 6,177 for 2019, the last pre-COVID full year, and the highest annual registrations since the 2006 figure of 8,306.</p><p>In 2021, 6,955 registrations were in craft apprenticeships, and largely in the construction sector, which will be vital for realising the ambition set out in <i>Housing for All</i>. There were 1,652 registrations on the newer, post-2016 programmes. At the end of 2021, the overall apprentice population was 24,212.</p><p>Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the COVID-related shutdown of on-site learning activity over the last two years had a significant impact on the ability of apprentices to access off-the-job training. Other apprenticeships have not been delayed in this way but may have had disruption to recruitment in, for instance, hospitality.</p><p>For the electrical apprenticeship in particular, while SOLAS endeavours to process apprentices in as timely a manner as possible, the overall duration of this apprenticeship is a minimum of four years for all phases to be successfully completed.</p><p>The waiting list is tackled in order of those apprentices who have been waiting longest.</p><p>A detailed and comprehensive emergency plan to tackle the apprentice waiting lists has been underway across further and higher education since August 2021 when some training facilities started to reopen. At that point 11,859 apprentices were delayed in their training.</p><p>Capital funding of &euro;20m was provided in 2020 to extend and upgrade craft apprenticeship facilities across further and higher education institutions. Classes that were running at half capacity under COVID 19 measures are now back at their full intake of 14-16 apprentices since last September.</p><p>Additional funding of &euro;17m was provided under Budget 2022 to further facilitate the SOLAS and HEA&rsquo;s response to the backlogs. &euro;6m is being invested in additional instructors, with over 100 additional posts approved.</p><p>Changed delivery structures for Phase 2 off-the-job training, facilitating a third intake of apprentices per annum have been introduced. In December, an opt-in rapid employer assessment at Phase 7 (on-the-job) was completed for apprentices who had finished Phase 6 and spent more than four years in their apprenticeship </p><p>More than 8,400 apprentices, or over 70% of those who were delayed in their training by COVID, have now progressed in their off-the-job phases. This includes over 700 final year apprentices who have been fast-tracked to complete their qualification. There has been an increase of over 50% in the number of training places available, via additional workshops and 100+ additional staff. </p><p>As of end March 2022, 7,875 craft apprentices were waiting for access to phase 2, 4, or 6 off-the-job training.</p><p>My Department, SOLAS, and other apprenticeship partners are continuing to work actively on further measures to ensure that waiting times are resolved as speedily as possible, enabling apprentices to progress through their apprenticeship as quickly as is feasible. </p></reply>

Investigations benefit from the Agency&rsquo;s global network of Liaison Prosecutors and Contact Points, giving prosecutors quick access to more than 50 jurisdictions around the world.</p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, have responsibility for the investigation of core international crimes and represent Ireland on the Network.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Ireland has certain extra-territorial jurisdiction under section 12(2) of the International Criminal Court Act 2006 which is not confined to suspects who are Irish residents/nationals. While Section 12(2) of the Act gives Ireland jurisdictional reach, as signatories to the Geneva Convention, Ireland is obliged to initiate a criminal investigation in circumstances where it can be proven that an ICC offence was committed involving an Irish national.</p>  <p>  I am advised that following his announcement of an investigation into the situation in Ukraine in March, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) wrote to all States Parties to the Rome Statute asking them to provide additional assistance to his Office in order to address the urgent resource needs that it is currently facing, specifically requesting voluntary financial contributions and the secondment of staff with specialist, forensic skills. This request is not explicitly linked to the Ukraine investigation and the requested assistance will be used on programmes that will benefit all of the ICC&rsquo;s investigations across many different countries.   </p>  <p>  Responding to that request, on 14 April, the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced &euro;3m in funding to the ICC, of which &euro;1m will be disbursed immediately to the Office.  The  request of the Prosecutor for secondment of specialist staff has also been brought to my attention and following consultation with the relevant agencies, I am considering how we can best respond. </p>  <p>  As the prosecutor general from Ukraine and the prosecutor of the ICC are anticipating prosecutions, it is clear that they are welcoming the support of Member States and the initiation of criminal investigations at a national level as this ensures the professional gathering of evidence, much of which may be displaced amongst refugees, which may be relevant to their subsequent prosecutions.  In this regard, a strategy to identify and collect relevant information and evidence is currently under consideration by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Chapter 3 of Part 5 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008, as amended, allows for DNA evidence to be provided to a designated state (evidence taken with consent only) or EU Member State in the context of criminal investigations or proceedings in that state, subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  Such evidence might be used in the context of a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings for offences that occurred in a state other than that requesting the evidence, depending on the jurisdiction of the requesting state.  </p></reply>

Operators offer one appointment per call, unless it is for an identifiable family group. To date, the service has offered 15,350 appointments with a further 10,850 appointments offered to 4 July 2022.</p>  <p>  The Registration Office&rsquo;s customer service team is also available to support customers who may have language difficulties or who may need assistance with translation. A number of multi-lingual videos describing the registration process and what to expect are available on my Department's website www.irishimmigration.ie.</p>  <p>  Since the onset of the pandemic, immigration permissions have been extended nine times, which means that people who held a valid permission to be in the State in March 2020 are legally permitted to remain until 31 May 2022.</p>  <p>  Dublin based customers who are seeking to renew their permission can continue to do so online at  inisonline.jahs.ie/user/login.</p></reply>

It is a priority of my Department to ensure that local groups are supported in their essential contributions to their local CCTV schemes, whilst ensuring appropriate, proportionate oversight of statutory data protection safeguards. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, community-based CCTV is currently governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee;</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller; and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.</p>  <p>  I can inform the deputy that, to date, there are currently 61 authorised and operational community based schemes. A breakdown of the approved schemes show that 35 have been approved for funding to a total value of &euro;948,649 and the Department is awaiting completion certificates from 26. A further 5 applications have been refused and one more was returned as not enough information was provided in the application. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Justice Plan 2022 commits to the publication of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill. This important legislation will make provision for Garda powers to use modern digital technology including body worn cameras, ANPR and CCTV, with a view to enactment by the Oireachtas.  The Bill will provide statutory underpinning for Garda overt recording, which will include CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner. The proposed Bill will repeal section 38 of the 2005 Garda Act and replace existing provisions with new CCTV provisions. This legislation can facilitate the role of CCTV in preventing and prosecuting those involved in criminal activity, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill was approved by the Government and published in April last year. Drafting of the Bill is continuing with the intention of publishing the Bill in the second quarter of 2022. The aim is to complete the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas later this year.</p></reply>

My Department is currently working to finalise the mode and terms of reference of the review.</p>  <p>  As part of the review process, it is intended that there will be significant consultation to ensure that the insights of a range of stakeholders regarding the operation of the scheme &ndash; and how best to support those of insufficient means with legal needs &ndash; will inform the work of the Review Group. Capturing the views of those who have unmet legal needs will be an important part of the Group&rsquo;s consultation and engagement.  One of the areas which may be considered in the review is eligibility for civil legal aid.</p>  <p>  Since the Civil Legal Aid Scheme was first established over 40 years ago, Irish society has changed and the demands on the Scheme have grown. In order to provide maximum benefit to those it was established to serve, within the finite resources available to fund legal aid, a robust, comprehensive review of the Scheme is now timely. Ultimately the review should map out a future for the Civil Legal Aid Scheme; one which will provide for a flexible service that has, as far as possible, the capacity and resources to respond to the priority legal assistance needs of those of insufficient means.</p>  <p>  Dependent on finalisation of the approach and confirmation of membership, it is envisaged that the Review Group will commence its work shortly.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that, at present, the Legal Aid Board offers free mediation services where parties cannot agree on the terms for their separation or divorce, parenting and/or maintenance issues. The Board's Family Mediation Service has remained open at every level of Covid-19 restrictions. It offers a blended service of room based, telephone, and online video mediation, depending on the needs of the clients. People are facilitated to resolve their issues and negotiate their own terms of settlement.</p></reply>

Earlier this year I briefed those working in the sector on the progress of the strategy as part of that ongoing consultation and while a draft was shared with them to facilitate their continued input, it was not published. A wider public consultation run by my Department concluded last month.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are currently working to finalise the strategy for submission to Government in light of submissions received in this final consultative phase.</p>  <p>  The strategy and aims will set a high level of ambition. I am also working on finalising an accompanying action plan for the rest of this year and next year which will set out how each of these aims will be achieved, which Departments and agencies are responsible for them, and the timeframe for delivery, so that it is targeted, precise and deliverable.</p>  <p>  I intend to bring both the finalised strategy and the action plan to Government in the coming weeks. They will both be published as soon as possible thereafter.</p>  <p>  I have said on a number of occasions that this new Strategy will be the most ambitious to date, and I intend to deliver on that.</p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.</p>  <p>  It is open to the applicant to contact the citizenship division at citizenshipinfo@justice.ie at any time for an update on their application</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The Government has supported An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing the threat from organised crime gangs through the introduction of a range of legislative measures.</p><p>This includes the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently being drafted and will provide, among other matters, for an increase in the penalty for conspiring to commit murder and soliciting to commit murder from a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p><p>I consider a maximum sentence of life imprisonment to be appropriate given the seriousness of the offences in question. The Deputy will appreciate that, ultimately, the Judiciary is best placed to decide on the appropriate sentence in any given case. The impact of all violent crime spreads far wider than the victims alone and it is vital that the powers available to the Judiciary are such as to provide an appropriate deterrent for conspiring to commit the most heinous crime of taking a person's life.</p><p>Work is continuing on the drafting of this Bill based on the General Scheme and further legal advices. I hope to be in a position to publish these provisions in the second quarter of this year.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has in place the National Drugs and Alcohol Strategy, &quot;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025&quot;. The Strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs, and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports the vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, using advanced analytical and intelligence methods. Garda&iacute; target dangerous criminals and organised criminal groups through the use of focused intelligence-led operations by specialist units and agencies such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.</p><p>The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. Its work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities, while working closely with international law enforcement partners.</p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized &euro;63.689m in illicit drugs, and seized cash of &euro;5.6m and &pound;38,751 (UK). In addition, &euro;8.23m and &pound;142,520 (UK) was forfeited to the State in 2021.</p><p>I can further inform the Deputy that on 2<sup></sup>July 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs. </p><p>Recent successes of Operation Tara include:</p><p>- &euro;1.75 million seizure of cocaine in Clondalkin on Friday, 15 April 2022.</p><p>- Approximately &euro;160,000 of suspected cocaine during the course of a search in County Wexford on the evening of 8 April 2022.</p><p>- &euro;580,000 in suspected cannabis herb and a man arrested following a search operation in the Castleblayney area of Co. Monaghan on 8 April 2022.</p><p>- &euro;140,000 worth of diamorphine and  a man arrested following a search operation in Clondalkin on 30 March 2022. </p><p>- &euro;700,000 of suspected heroin and one man arrested following a search operation in Co. Clare on 25 March 2022.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the compilation and publication of all crime statistics.  The CSO produces these statistics using data recorded on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s PULSE system and makes regular releases under reservation in relation to various crime statistics.  The CSO also continues to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to address quality issues in the underlying sources used to compile the statistics.  </p><p>Figures are published quarterly by the CSO at the following link: www.cso.ie/en/statistics/crimeandjustice/.</p></reply>

This includes funding and support for 20 domestic violence refuges and funding to a range of organisations providing accommodation-based services to victims of domestic violence.</p>  <p>  To date, funding the revenue cost of refuge services has been provided through Tusla and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Housing Authorities have been key stakeholders around capital funding of new refuge developments.</p>  <p>  Refuge services supported by Tusla typically comprise short-term emergency accommodation in a secure, high support setting for women and children at medium to high risk whose needs can&rsquo;t be met in other settings. Only a minority of those experiencing domestic violence and engaging with support services need to access a refuge. In general terms, the need for provision of the current refuge model of service for men or transgender people on an extensive basis has not been a feature of Tusla engagement with stakeholders to date.</p>  <p>  However, Tusla recognises the importance of having available and responsive DSGBV services for people of all genders, with the need to consider access to safe accommodation for men fleeing domestic violence. To begin to address this, Tusla is focusing on developing pathways to safe accommodation for men. Access to designated safe supported domestic violence accommodation for men is being established in 2022 in the Dublin area initially, but it is expected that this type of initiative will be extended once an effective approach can be established.  </p>  <p>  Tusla funds two organisations to provide dedicated supports to men who are dealing with domestic violence, Men&rsquo;s Aid and the Men&rsquo;s Development Network. Increased funding has been provided to both of these organisations since 2020 to extend their services.</p>  <p>  Both of these organisations can provide support, information and signposting for men who may need safe accommodation. Men (and their children, as relevant) who need to access accommodation because of domestic violence can be supported to access accommodation through Housing Authorities, and the Domestic Violence pathway to Rent Supplement introduced by the Department of Social Protection in 2020 is available to all victims, regardless of gender.</p>  <p>  Tusla published a review of accommodation for victims of domestic violence in February 2022. An initial ten priority locations were identified for development of new refuge services. Implementation of findings from this review is being led by my Department and will be taken forward in the context of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The strategy is gender neutral. </p>  <p>  Addressing the range of needs for those who experience domestic violence, particularly for people with complex or additional needs, is identified as a recommendation from the domestic violence accommodation review, and relevant actions are due to be included in the strategy, which I intend to bring to Government in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  Given the current rate of delivery of accommodation I have established a high level Inter-Departmental Group to critically review the existing model of accommodation and develop revised model(s) of delivery.</p>  <p>  Any groups with proposals around new refuge developments have been invited to notify Tusla in the first instance on plans in this regard.</p></reply>

Critically, after Brexit, UK transfers do not fall under the Framework Decision and will continue to take place under the Convention and existing 1995 Act. </p>  <p>  The issues involved are particularly complex given the wide range of possible sentencing structures that may be involved, and that the amended regime must be suitable to deal not only with transfers from the UK, but also from other Convention states. </p>  <p>  The Government approved heads of amendments to the Convention regime in December 2021. An outline of these amendments is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Work is continuing on the formal drafting of these amendments and I expect to introduce them as soon as possible at Report Stage of the Bill.</p></reply>

Ordinarily these internships run throughout the academic year (i.e. September to May).</p><p>I have provided details of internships which were facilitated by my Department in 2021 below for the Deputy&rsquo;s consideration:</p><p>- Legal Internships: My Department has developed partnerships with a number of Third Level Institutions in Ireland to facilitate applications from law students who wish to complete a legal internship with my Department.. The successful candidates are placed on an 8 month paid internship within my Department and the remuneration for this internship placement opportunity is in line with the first point of the Executive Officer PPC Salary Scale. During 2021, my Department facilitated 7 legal internships.</p><p>- Willing Able Mentoring programme: My Department also collaborates with &lsquo;Ahead&rsquo; on their Willing Able Mentoring programme (WAM). This programme aims to promote access to the labour market for graduates with disabilities and to build the capacity of employers to integrate disability into the mainstream workplace. The remuneration for this internship placement opportunity is in line with the first point of the Executive Officer PPC Salary Scale. During 2021, my Department facilitated 2 internships from the Willing and Able Mentoring Programme.</p><p>- ICT Business Internship:<b></b>My Department also works with Third Level Institutions to facilitate ICT business internship placements. The remuneration for this internship placement opportunity is in line with the first point of the Clerical Officer PPC Salary Scale.  During 2021, my Department facilitated 1 person on the ICT business internship placement.</p><p>With regard to internship programmes undertaken by the agencies, bodies and offices under the aegis of my Department, the Deputy may wish to note that, on 30th November 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;nalaunched the first Garda Diversity Internship. The programme is in line with a key recommendation of the Report on the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which specifically identified a need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to strengthen its efforts to recruit a more diverse workforce through the development of an Access Programme, aligned with national inclusive education initiatives. Delivery of this programme fulfils an objective of the current police reform programme &lsquo;A Policing Service for our Future&rsquo;.</p><p>I am informed that 28 interns are now employed on the programme on a full-time, short-term basis; 13 third level graduates and 15 recent school leavers. I understand that graduate interns to this programme are employed on an 11-month contract which concludes at the end of November 2022, and that these interns are remunerated on a pro-rata basis at point 1 of the Executive Officer salary scale.</p><p>I am also informed that school-leaver interns are employed on a 9-month contract which concludes at the end of August 2022 and that these interns are remunerated on a pro rata basis at point 1 of the Clerical Officer salary scale. This internship aims to increase the accessibility and understanding of, and potential for, a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for school-leavers and graduates, particularly those from groups typically underrepresented in the organisation.</p><p>I am informed that the Psychology Service of the Irish Prison Service (IPS) currently has the following students engaged in full-time or part-time internships/higher education courses:</p><p>- Two students are completing PhDs researching the National Violence Reduction Unit which is attached to the Midlands Prison and a review of a new model of engagement by the IPS and Probation Service with Life Sentence Prisoners.</p><p>- Five students are completing Masters in Applied Psychology &ndash; Mental Health, with University College Cork. These students are provided with placement experience two days per week from January to July each year as part of their Masters Programme.  These five students are currently assigned to Arbour Hill Prison, Wheatfield Prison, Mountjoy Prison, Cork Prison and the Midlands Prison.  There is no cost to the IPS. </p><p>Details of the number of interns in the Courts Service<b></b>for the years 2020-2021 are provided in the following table.  I am advised that these interns are paid the first point on the Clerical Officer Salary scale. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Number of interns</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>12 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 </td>       <td>12 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that the Legal Aid Board facilitated 16 Third Level students on internships since 2021. I am advised that no remuneration was received by the interns and that the Board do not have a limit on internships accepted annually. I understand that the internships are both part time and full time and range from 2 weeks to 3 months.</p><p>I am informed that the Policing Authority runs a student internship programme each year and that the Authority usually accepts one student intern annually. Student Interns are remunerated at the first point of the Clerical Officer PPC scale and salary is pro-rated for the duration of the contract, and that in 2021/22 academic year this amounted to &euro;9,773.</p><p>I am advised that the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) had 2 transition years students on work experience in 2019 &ndash; one student for 5 days and one for 10 days. I understand there was no cost to the CAB.</p><p><b></b>Forensic Science Ireland (FSI) supervise research projects in collaboration with National and International Universities and, as part of this work, supervise approximately 1-2 students per year. I am informed that these are usually short term projects but can extend up to 9 months, and that the students do not receive remuneration of any kind.</p><p>Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) currently has two legal interns, both of whom were recruited through my Department&rsquo;s internship programme.</p><p>Finally, I have also included details of the number of interns in the International Protection Appeals Tribunal for the years 2018-2021 in the following table.

This is a fundamental exercise of State sovereignty, which is  necessary to protect the security of the State and to prevent illegal immigration. The exercise of powers in this area is at all times subject to the law and to respect for individual rights.</p>  <p>  The Border Management Unit (BMU) of my Department has responsibility for frontline immigration duties at Dublin Airport only. Other ports of entry are the responsibility of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).</p>  <p>  Under Section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004, an Immigration Officer must determine whether a non-EEA national should be granted leave to land and thus gain entry to the State. In performing their duties, an Immigration Officer is required to consider all of the circumstances of the non-EEA national at the time of entry.</p>  <p>  If a person indicates or is identified as being in need of international protection, they are admitted to the international protection process. However, they will still be recorded as a refusal of leave to land.</p>  <p>  A refusal of leave to land by the Border Management Unit (BMU) is first considered by the Immigration Officer and is always signed off by a more senior officer. There is no appeal process, but it is important to note that a refusal of leave to land, unlike a deportation or a removal order, is specific to the arrival instance and does not preclude the person from seeking to enter the State in the future if they satisfy the conditions for entry. The principle of non-refoulement applies to these decisions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-26a.3421.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600115#WRKKK03600"><p>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Implementing the recommendations of the Review of Protections for Vulnerable Witnesses in the Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual Offences, known as The O'Malley Review, has been a priority for me since I published the review in August of 2020. </p><p>As I know the Deputy is aware, in October 2020 I published and commenced implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey, our ambitious plan to implement all the recommendations of The O'Malley Review, and I am chairing an Implementation Oversight Group comprising all relevant departments and agencies responsible for driving the implementation of the agreed actions.</p><p>The last meeting of the oversight group was held in February and I received an update on how each of the actions are progressing. I am happy with the progress that is being made, thanks to the shared dedication of all participants to reform our criminal justice system and to make sure the needs of the victim are paramount throughout the process.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy's request to have an update on the actions provided in tabular form, I have attached the latest Implementation Group Traffic Light Progress Table from Q1 of this year.</p><p>As part of the implementation of Supporting a Victims Journey, I have set up a number of sub-groups to work on advancing some of the high priority recommendations.</p><p>The first of these were tasked with mapping the journey that faces the victim and reviewing the availability of supports and the funding of civil society organisations providing frontline services. This subgroup commissioned an expert consultant to analyse and categorise the supports provided with grant funding made available by my Department.</p><p>The consultant identified a) geographical areas and b) categories of victims which represent gaps or unmet needs in the current provision of these support services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system. The consultant completed this exercise in July of last year and my Department contacted identified NGOs to distribute additional funding to provide additional services to address the gaps identified.</p><p>Recently I announced funding totaling &euro;4.6m for more than 60 organisations to support victims of crime. This is an increase of over 20% on the previous total fund of &euro;3.8m which was made available in 2021.</p><p>A second subgroup is carrying out work on the introduction of Intermediaries and the establishment of a pilot programme. An academic consultant from the University of Limerick, with the support of the sub-group, has been tasked with developing the framework for the operation and training of intermediaries and will engage with stakeholders in development of such. Development of the course content is currently underway.  Once training of these intermediaries has taken place, a pilot will take place in two locations; one in Dublin and one in a rural area.</p><p>The final subgroup is focused on developing specialist Training (Legal and otherwise) for the full range of frontline staff and professionals, including legal professionals. My Department has engaged a consultant to conduct a mapping exercise to establish what training is already being provided, and in what areas.</p><p>This exercise has commenced and aims to have a relatively short timeframe for completion so that the development work can begin. Building on that, the subgroup will then design a framework for provision of a range of training and awareness raising measures for those engaging with victims of sexual crime and vulnerable witnesses, and the categorisation of headings for specific types of training needed.</p><p>Outside of the work of the sub-groups, a number of key actions have been delivered as part of implementing Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey including:</p><p>- The introduction of preliminary trial hearings;</p><p>- The nationwide rollout of Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSUs);</p><p>- The first cohort of staff at a new sexual offences unit in the Director of Public Prosecutions office formally took up their roles last year;</p><p>- The establishment of a Victims&rsquo; Forum to provide further opportunities to engage closely with frontline organisations who support victims; and</p><p>- Work to promote the rights that victims of crime have and the supports that are available to them is advancing, including through the development of a new Victims Charter website www.victimscharter.ie and the distribution of informative printed material to public locations around the country.</p><p>In relation to the updates on sexual offences legislation that have been recommended in the O&rsquo;Malley Report, work has started on drafting the heads of a General Scheme of a Sexual Offences Bill, which is expected to go to Government later this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-26a.3424.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600115#WRKKK03900"><p>I can confirm that I have received the correspondence referred to and can assure the Deputy that tackling these heinous crimes is a priority for me, my Department and this Government. </p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I am leading on the preparation of a new national strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals set out. In February, I briefed those working in the sector on the progress of the strategy as part of that ongoing consultation, and a wider public consultation run by my Department concluded in March.</p><p>The strategy will set out the government's plan for a zero tolerance approach to domestic, sexual and gender based violence. I am also working on finalising an accompanying action plan for the rest of this year and next year which will set out how each of these aims will be achieved, which Departments and agencies are responsible for them, and the timeframe for delivery, so that our work is targeted, ambitious and deliverable.</p><p>It is intended that both the finalised strategy and the action plan will be brought to Government in the coming weeks. </p><p>I also intend, for the first time, to establish in law a national agency tasked with responsibility for Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence.</p><p>The agency will be responsible for overseeing all of the actions set out in the Third National Strategy and for delivering domestic violence services.</p><p>It will bring together the expertise that already exists within TUSLA and in the Department of Justice and will report to me, as Minister for Justice. </p><p>The agency will work closely with those departments and agencies and with the sector to ensure the services it provides are meeting the needs of victims of DSGBV and of the sector that support them.</p><p>The implementation plan I will bring to Government along with the Third National Strategy in the coming weeks will also set out what the proposals are in relation to the establishment of this newagency. It will also set out the interim relationship between my Department and Tusla until that agency is established.</p><p>It is anticipated that the new Agency will be up-and-running within 18 months.</p><p>In addition to this work, my Department is also continuing to drive forward the implementation of Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey. We are determined to implement this plan in full so that when a victim of a crime comes forward, they will be safe in the knowledge that they will be supported, informed and treated with respect and dignity at every stage of their journey through the criminal justice system.</p><p>As part of delivering the actions in this plan, I recently signed an order to bring into operation the Criminal Procedure Act 2021. This Act provides for the use of preliminary trial hearings which will significantly improve the trial process for victims of sexual offences, including by reducing delay and disruption that might re-traumatise victims.</p><p>In relation to education and awareness raising in our fight against sexual and gender-based violence, I agree this is an important part of our work and that we must ensure we implement the programmes we have that work - not just at primary level but also at secondary level and in higher and further education and college as well. </p><p>We must also ensure that education takes place in our homes and that parents have conversations with children. Partners, work colleagues and friends should have these difficult conversations.</p><p>Over the past number of years, my Department been working to raise awareness generally about how we, as a society, need to stop excusing unacceptable behaviour.</p><p>The No Excuses campaign, for example, highlights this determination to challenge people and the culture, prejudice and values that allow any form of sexual harassment or sexual violence. As a society we all have a role to play in preventing sexual harassment and sexual violence and the No Excuses campaign underpins the message that sexual violence and harassment will not be tolerated and reminds people to take action when it is safe to do so.</p><p>Under the Third National Strategy, the Government will continue to work with our partners on raising awareness of DSGBV and on changing attitudes to it. As part of this we are developing an awareness campaign on the meaning and importance of consent in healthy relationships.</p><p>I am also focused on strengthening legislation to combat all forms of DSGBV and I recently secured Government approval to draft legislation to make stalking and non-fatal strangulation standalone offences.</p><p>While both stalking and non-fatal strangulation are already crimes, I am proposing a number of changes to make the law in this area clearer and stronger.</p><p>These new provisions, which will be included in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, will:</p><p>- Amend section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to introduce a standalone stalking offence, and amend the existing harassment offence</p><p>- Empower the courts to issue orders restraining stalking behaviours without a criminal prosecution</p><p>- Strengthen procedural protections for alleged victims of stalking during the court process</p><p>- Introduce a standalone offence of non-fatal strangulation</p><p>The evidence is that when a specific stalking offence is introduced, it leads to a greater awareness of the crime and an increase in the number of crimes reported and ultimately prosecuted.</p><p>In the summer, I will publish a new Hate Crime Bill which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender. This will mean that certain types of crimes can be prosecuted as hate crimes where they are motivated by misogyny.</p><p>For other crimes, where there isn&rsquo;t a dedicated hate-aggravated offence, the new legislation will require the court to take misogyny into account where there is evidence that this was the motivation, to reflect that fact in the sentence, and to reflect the fact that the crime was aggravated by this form of prejudice in the formal record. </p><p>Before the end of September, I will publish a new Sexual Offences Bill which will introduce important changes including:</p><p>- Extending victim anonymity to further categories of victims</p><p>- Repealing provisions for sentences to be delivered in public</p><p>- Legal representation for victims </p><p>Separately, I will seek to enact the Sex Offenders Bill within months which will strengthen the management and monitoring of sex offenders in the community.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-26a.3427.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600115#WRKKK04200"><p>I can confirm to the Deputy that the review is due to be finalised shortly and the updated scorecards are expected to issue in the coming weeks. The slight delay in introducing the updated scorecards partly reflects my Department's desire to take on board additional stakeholder feedback that has been received in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  The scorecard was introduced to help applicants to complete their applications with greater certainty than before. Since the go-live of the scorecards, my officials inform me that there has not been any reduction in the number of applications being received when compared to previous years, however, a preliminary review of applications received in recent weeks indicates that the quality of the applications has markedly improved. </p>  <p>  This is a welcome development and builds on other innovative measures recently introduced in the citizenship application process, including the deployment of &ldquo;Tara&rdquo; the e-chat bot, e-payments, e-tax clearance and Garda&iacute; e-vetting, and the removal of the requirement to provide the original passport when making an application, all of which have positively enhanced the applicant's experience.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that for some applicants the scorecard may not have adequately addressed their individual circumstances.  In such cases, the Citizenship Division of my Department may accept a sworn affidavit, which could make up the deficit in points to enable the applicant to meet the necessary threshold. The affidavit will not be accepted in lieu of all appropriate proofs, only to make up the shortfall to enable the score of 150 points to be reached.</p>  <p>  A previous examination by my Department of the citizenship application process indicated that incorrectly submitted applications were diverting considerable resources from general processing, resulting in the slowing down of all applications and adversely impacting on customer service. Considerable effort has therefore gone into clarifying the application guidelines published on my Department's immigration website (www.irishimmigration.ie) and and on making the application process itself more customer friendly, including the introduction of the new scorecard structure for proof of identity and residence.</p></reply>

The Policy provides for the resolution of matters through local resolution, mediation, investigation or a combination of all three.</p>  <p>  All Recruit Prison Officers receive training on the Policy which outlines the right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment and the options available in the event that they feel they have been sexually harassed.  This training also forms part of Continuing Professional Development.   </p>  <p>  Information for staff on the Policy, the process and the supports available can be accessed on the Prison Service intranet system and can, of course, be accessed on a strictly confidential basis from the HR Directorate.</p>  <p>  I can further advised the Deputy that in 2019 the Prison Service engaged with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre to assist in appropriately addressing sexual harassment and sexual assault of staff in the workplace, to ensure the proper support systems are in place.</p>  <p>  Workshops were run from late 2019 into March 2020 and all Governors, Directors, Staff Support Officers, Employee Assistance Officers and some HQ staff attended in order to equip them with the tools necessary to support affected staff.</p>  <p>  In 2021, a Guidelines and FAQ document was circulated to all staff which brought together in one publication, the measures to take in the event of a staff member witnessing, or becoming aware of an alleged case of sexual harassment and/or assault.  </p>  <p>  This area of work will continue to be the subject of ongoing attention and development within the IPS.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that, while the question from the Deputy refers to protected disclosures training, the procedures outlined in the Protected Disclosures Policy of the Irish Prison Service, in keeping with the relevant legislation, are not intended to act as a substitute for normal day to day operational reporting or other internal employment procedures.  The Policy further outlines that personal complaints should generally be dealt with under the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Grievance or Dignity at Work Procedures, as referred to above.</p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

I fully appreciate the strong emotional attachment we all have to our pets and that theft not only leads to their loss in our lives, but also a high level of concern for their welfare. It is also a crime which often affects, and is indeed often targeted against, older and particularly vulnerable people, for whom their pet is of huge emotional importance.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that theft offences already apply to this crime, and can carry very heavy penalties. The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment is provided for the offence of possession of stolen property.</p><p>When imposing sentence, judges are not limited to considering the monetary value of a pet &ndash; the emotional distress to the victim caused by the offence is absolutely relevant and can be, and is, taken into account where appropriate. However, I acknowledge that the existing offence considers the offence as being one against property rather than a person or an animal and I am committed to examining the options to address the issue, including, if necessary, making legislative changes.</p><p>From an enforcement perspective, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes this issue very seriously and has conducted several important actions against those responsible. Garda&iacute; have also disseminated information through the national Crime Prevention Officer Network regarding keeping animals secure and preventing these forms of theft. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety, which is in line with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe, can be viewed on the Garda website.</p><p>I would like to also emphasise the importance of microchipping. Every dog must be microchipped by the time it reaches 12 weeks of age, or earlier if it is sold or moved from its place of birth (Microchipping of Dogs Regulation 2015), and the microchip must be registered with an authorised database. Microchipping of all dogs protects the animals&rsquo; welfare, and assists with speedy identification of lost or stolen dogs and their owners. It is an offence to keep a dog over 12 weeks that has not been chipped and it is an offence to sell such a dog. Microchips can be easily checked at vets and by Garda&iacute;. They are by far and away the most effective means of tracking and identifying dogs.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture have also made regulations covering the advertising for sale of animals under the Animal Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pets Regulations) 2019.</p><p>I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na record and investigate any report of the theft of a dog in line with their crime recording and investigation policies. Detection of dog theft is subject to intelligence led operations and the relevant information coming to hand.</p><p>To be of assistance to the Deputy, I have contacted the Garda Authorities and have been advised that the table below shows the number of incidents of reported dog theft in recent years. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year Reported</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2022</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>No. of Stolen Dogs</td>       <td>145</td>       <td>204</td>       <td>228</td>       <td>280</td>       <td>22*</td>    </tr> </table> * Includes incidents reported up to and including 18th April 2022.</p><p>Incident counts are based on reported date and were collated based on operational PULSE data as of 1:30am on the 19th of April 2022. Crime counting rules not applied and figures are provisional based on PULSE object descriptions of 'Dogs' within the 'Animals/Livestock/Poultry&rsquo; category and linked to reported incidents as &lsquo;Stolen&rsquo;. All figures are operational and subject to change. </p></reply>

The Commissioner is also responsible for the recruitment and training of Garda members and staff under the Act and, as Minister, I have no direct role in these independent functions.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs, with an unprecedented allocation provided in Budget 2022 of over &euro;2 billion. This includes funding for the recruitment of up to an additional 800 Garda members and up to 400 Garda staff.   In this regard I welcome the strong interest shown in the latest Garda recruitment competition, with over 10,000 applications received. </p>  <p>  Additionally, over 800 Garda members have also been redeployed in recent years from administrative duties to frontline policing roles where their expertise can be utilised fully. The continual commitment to this policy of redeployment has impacted and will continue to impact positively on local communities across the country, contributing to a more visible police presence.</p>  <p>  I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. The full complement of resources fluctuates on an ongoing basis and where a deficiency in resources is identified, the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p>  <p>  I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to them, having regard to the profile of each area within the division and its specific needs. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that at 31 March 2022, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 802 Garda members and 65 Garda staff assigned to the DMR North Division. This represents respective increases of 8% and 38% respectively since December 2012, when there were 744 Garda&iacute; and 47 Garda staff assigned to the Division. </p>  <p>  In the interests of transparency, detailed information in relation to Garda numbers is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  This information is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and includes the number of Garda&iacute; by station across the whole country.</p>  <p>  The information can be found at the following link: www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/An_Garda_Siochana_facts_and_figures.</p></reply>

These extensions were available to the person referred to by the Deputy and would have allowed them to remain in the State until 31 May 2022, if they had chosen to do so.</p>  <p>  My Department has responsibility for immigration-related matters, including the entry and residence conditions of non-EEA students, who are granted a Stamp 2 immigration permission, and continually consults and engages with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, among other key sectorial stakeholders, in this area.</p>  <p>  Since April 2001, non-EEA students with an immigration Stamp 2 permission, and who are enrolled on courses with education providers listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) including English language courses, have been afforded the opportunity to work. This allows them to take up casual employment to supplement their income while studying in Ireland. During term time, non-EEA students can work up to 20 hours per week and during normal college holiday periods they can work on a full time basis up to 40 hours per week.</p>  <p>  The Stamp 2 permission will typical expire shortly after the conclusion of the course. If a person wishes to remain in the State and to be allowed to work, they will then need to have a prospective employer apply for an employment permit on their behalf and to seek a change of permission to a Stamp 1G, if they met the criteria.  If unsuccessful, the student is required to leave the State.</p>  <p>  A Stamp 1G indicates that a person has permission to look for employment in the State under the Third Level Graduate Programme. When an applicant has completed their studies in Ireland and gained an award at Level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or above, that person may qualify for a Stamp 1G for 12 months. Where an individual receives an award at Level 9 NFQ, they may qualify for a Stamp 1G for up to 24 months subject to the overall limit of 8 years on student conditions that applies. Graduates at level 9 NFQ or above who qualify for a Stamp 1G permission will be granted the permission for 12 months initially, further details are available on my Department's website at www.irishimmigration.ie/my-situation-has-changed-since-i-arrived-in-ireland/third-level-graduate-programme/.</p>  <p>  A person must hold a critical skills employment permit for 2 years or a general employment permit for 5 years before eligibility for a Stamp 4 immigration permission arises.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-26a.3472.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600116#WRLLL01900"><p>The resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation of in excess of &euro;2 billion in Budget 2022. This allocation provides for the recruitment of up to an additional 800 Garda members and 400 Garda staff. I note the strong interest in a career as a Garda member in the recent Garda recruitment campaign, with over 10,000 applications received. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business. Under Section 33 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), the Commissioner determines the deployment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State. As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions and am unable to seek to direct the Commissioner in such matters, as establishing a unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for any purpose. </p>  <p>  I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of Garda members throughout the State under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is optimally positioned to keep our communities safe.</p>  <p>  I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do not propose to establish a dedicated transport policing unit at this time. </p>  <p>  I can however inform the Deputy that Garda management engages extensively with transport operators, including the National Transport Authority, Irish Rail (DART and InterCity rail) and Transdev Ireland (Luas) to provide a high visibility presence through a co-ordinated approach.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a range of regional and local operations have been put in place to prevent and detect criminal activity and anti-social behaviour on public transport. For example, Operation Twin Track was a Community Engagement and Rail Safety Policing Initiative conducted by Garda&iacute; in partnership with other public transportation stakeholders with the purpose of providing high visibility policing of rail and light rail transport within the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) and nationwide, and to deliver crime prevention advice.</p>  <p>  A multi-agency review was conducted to examine the effectiveness of this operation and it was agreed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to proactively engage with public transportation stakeholders and providers to conduct further similar operations.</p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, in January 2022, to further support, enhance and strengthen the strategic and operational objectives of Operation Citizen in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR). Assistant Commissioner, DMR launched Operation Saul to provide a safe environment for commuters utilising public transport services in the DMR together with reassuring the citizens, visitors and the business community in Dublin that it is a safe place in which to visit, socialise, conduct business and enjoy all its amenities. </p>  <p>  Operation Saul currently operates in DMR South Central, North Central &amp;amp; South Divisions, however, plans are ongoing to extend this operation to the entire DMR Region. </p>  <p>  The aim of Operational Saul is to co-ordinate and manage all working resources in each Division to deliver both an overt and covert policing presence around the environs of Luas, DART and Bus services in Dublin, on a regular and, where necessary, daily basis. I am advised that this will be achieved through the following measures;</p>  <p>  - Allocating overt beat personnel to Luas, DART and Bus services to perform high visibility patrols to prevent and detect anti-social behaviour and public order offences.</p>  <p>  - Reducing opportunities for anti-social behaviour while dealing proactively and professionally with any public order issues through a zero tolerance approach.</p>  <p>  - Acting to prevent and detect crime, preserve the peace and minimise disruption to Luas, DART and Bus services.</p>  <p>  - In partnership with partner agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deployed on duties under Operation Saul will achieve a common goal of making this service safe. </p>  <p>  - Improve the quality of day to day life for local stakeholders, businesses and commuters of Luas, DART and Bus services.</p>  <p>  - Issuing Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBO) where appropriate.</p>  <p>  - Issuing Fixed Charge Penalty Notices (FCPNs) in respect of certain offences, where detected and appropriate.</p>  <p>  - Effecting arrests in appropriate circumstances. </p>  <p>  - Record all patrols under Operation Saul with Superintendent, Communications Centre on CAD incident number.</p>  <p>  Each Chief Superintendent in the DMR ensures regular collaboration under Operation Saul with partner agencies in order to ensure the success and sustainability of the initiative. Central to the success of this initiative is maintaining a strong partnership with transport partner agencies. Quarterly, if not more regular, meetings are required to take place between appropriate members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in each Division in the DMR to examine any issues and review existing approaches and to inform partner agencies on upcoming plans, operations and advancements in the area of managing these issues in the public transport sphere.</p></reply>

Work is ongoing as a priority to legislate for hate crime and hate speech, to ensure that Ireland is a safe and secure place for all.</p>  <p>  A hate crime occurs where an offence is committed (for example assault or criminal damage), but where the victim is targeted because of their association, in the mind of the perpetrator, with a particular identity characteristic, e.g. sexual orientation or ethnicity.</p>  <p>  Hate crimes are signal crimes. They tell the victim that they are not safe simply because of who they are. They send the disgusting message to victims that they, and people like them, are somehow lesser than the rest of us which is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  These crimes are motivated by prejudice. They make victims feel afraid for their future, their friends and their families. They lead to a divided society, where whole communities can feel unsafe and angry. It&rsquo;s important that we recognize the true harm of these crimes and ensure that our legislative framework can tackle them.</p>  <p>  On 16 April 2021 I published the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2021. Following its publication, the General Scheme was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny, which took place on 17 November 2021.</p>  <p>  I recently published Justice Plan 2022 and in it I have committed to advancing this work and to publishing the Hate Crime Bill in quarter 2 of this year.</p>  <p>  The Bill will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic. The aggravated offences will generally carry an enhanced penalty, compared to the ordinary offence, and the record of any conviction for such an offence would clearly state that the offence was a hate crime.</p>  <p>  It may also interest the Deputy to know that Ireland&rsquo;s first National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2022 was published on 28 November 2019 and complements the National LGBTI Youth Strategy published in June 2018.</p>  <p>  The Inclusion strategy was developed in partnership with the LGBTI+ Community through a number of consultations and workshops across the country. A Strategy Committee is in place to oversee implementation of the Inclusion Strategy. This Committee is chaired by Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, T.D.</p>  <p>  The strategy contains a number of actions by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deepen the LGBTI+ awareness among frontline officers and increase the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond to the needs of victims of hate crime and to have an improved understanding of the LGBTI+ community in general.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that as part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s ongoing national response to Hate Crime, the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit (GNDIU) provide assurance to members of the public in relation to reports of hate-based occurrences. This includes daily monitoring of all recorded Hate Crimes / Incidents on PULSE and Social Media, advising investigating members, supporting investigations and providing assurance to victims and their communities.</p>  <p>  I am advised that in response to recent alleged homophobic incidents, the Garda National Diversity and Integration Unit have provided direct on the ground support to investigators and to the LGBT+ community</p>  <p>  A new, non-emergency Online Hate Crime reporting mechanism was launched in July 2021 to improve accessibility to the Garda service for victims of all types of Hate Crime. It is available via the garda.ie website and provides a safe and secure environment for victims, who may previously have been reluctant to report in person to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  To increase confidence and provide support and direction to Garda members in identifying, recording, investigating and prosecuting Hate Crime, a Policy Document - Responding to Hate Crime and Non-Crime Hate Incidents was developed and published in 2021. Additional procedures, aide memoire and information sheets have been provided to all Garda personnel and published on internal platforms.</p>  <p>  A number of publicity campaigns have been held in support of the launch of the Online Hate Crime Reporting System, which included publicity and explanatory videos on garda.ie (script in 19 languages); and a Hate Crime information campaign with the publication and distribution of Hate Crime leaflets in 19 languages. </p>  <p>  Internal communication platforms were utilised to run in conjunction with public campaigns. A further Hate Crime publicity campaign is planned for 2022.</p>  <p>  Following a full independent review of the Garda Diversity Training in January 2020, a new organisational approach to training is in the final stages of development and will be delivered throughout 2022. The training programme will increase Garda confidence in dealing with reports of Hate Crime.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that Garda Diversity Officers (GDOs) are Garda&iacute; and Sergeants, trained, developed and supported to actively engage with and attend to the concerns of minority, diverse and hard to reach communities - providing reassurance, building trust and extending the accessibility of the Garda Service.</p>  <p>  There are currently 331 GDOs throughout the country in every Garda division, who are supported by a Divisional Diversity Inspector. An up-to-date list containing the locations and contact details of GDOs is published on the Garda website.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is currently being drafted and will provide, among other matters, for an increase in the penalty for conspiring to commit murder and soliciting to commit murder from a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>  <p>  I consider a maximum sentence of life imprisonment to be appropriate given the seriousness of the offences in question. The Deputy will appreciate that, ultimately, the Judiciary is best placed to decide on the appropriate sentence in any given case. The impact of all violent crime spreads far wider than the victims alone and it is vital that the powers available to the Judiciary are such as to provide an appropriate deterrent for conspiring to commit the most heinous crime of taking a person's life.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing on the drafting of this Bill based on the General Scheme and further legal advices. Justice Plan 2022 commits to the publication of these provisions in the second quarter of this year.</p>  <p>  The Justice Plan also commits to working to break the link between gangs and the children they seek to recruit. In 2022, we will progress draft legislation to outlaw the grooming of children into a life of crime. In parallel, we will continue to roll out a community intervention programme &ldquo;Greentown&rdquo; which seeks to break the link between children who are engaged or at risk of engaging with a criminal gang. </p>  <p>  These new measures will build on legislative measures which have already been taken in recent years, such as:</p>  <p>  - The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016, which provides additional Garda powers for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of;</p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014, providing for the establishment and operation of the DNA database providing Garda&iacute; with links between people and unsolved crimes;</p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, introduced to protect the justice system from being subverted by criminal groups, including potential intimidation of juries.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na strengthened its capacity to tackle organised crime in 2015, through the creation of the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB), which is headed by a Detective Chief Superintendent reporting to Assistant Commissioner, Organised &amp;amp; Serious Crime. The role is to proactively, via intelligence led investigations, target top tier Organised Crime Groups (OCGs) impacting on this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  This is achieved through effective collaboration with all sections of Organised &amp;amp; Serious Crime, and other sections within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through partnerships with other law enforcement agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Naval Service, and partnerships developed with international law enforcement agencies globally.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized &euro;63.689m in illicit drugs, and seized cash of &euro;5.6m and &pound;38,751 (UK). In addition, &euro;8.23m and &pound;142,520 (UK) was forfeited to the State in 2021.</p>  <p>  I can further inform the Deputy that on 2 July 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that recent successes of Operation Tara include the seizure of drugs valued at in excess of  &euro;388,000 following a search operation in Finglas on Wednesday 20th April 2022.</p></reply>

Due to the pandemic, it has not been possible to hold such ceremonies since March 2020.  </p>  <p>  In January 2021, a temporary system was established to enable citizenship applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty to the State. This has temporarily replaced the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies.</p>  <p>  In spite of the restrictions imposed by public health guidelines, last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest level since 2015. </p></reply>

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team. </p>  <p>  It is open to the applicant to contact the citizenship division at citizenshipinfo@justice.ie at any time for an update on their application.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

Following this process Ms. Marie O&rsquo;Shea, B.L. was appointed as the independent Chair and she has commenced her work. The undertaking of this tendering process, as opposed to the direct appointment of a Chair, is consistent with the discussion at the Committee meeting.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, the following link, provided to my Department by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, outlines the number of patients over 75 years of age on Outpatient and Inpatient waiting lists by  specialty by hospital at the end of March 2022.</p><p>">Waiting Lists</p></reply>

Cardiac rehabilitation is considered an essential component of secondary prevention for patients with cardiovascular disease due to the rigorous and extensive evidence base supporting its clinical effectiveness and is of importance for patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure.</p>  <p>  Cardiac Rehabilitation is specifically tailored for those with established CVD, and patient outcomes are highly dependent on the quality of CR service delivered. Cardiac Rehabilitation is delivered through four phases, from the initial cardiac event in hospital to phase four in the community. The number of patients (5,063) accessing CR in 2019 increased by 25% from 2010.  There are also ever-increasing referrals of more complex, older and frail patients with multiple comorbidities to cardiac rehabilitation programmes which, while bringing additional challenges, can result in tremendous individual gains in health and wellbeing for those patients.</p>  <p>  Recent Irish Heart Attack Audit data suggest a 71% referral rate to cardiac rehabilitation programmes.  There are at least 36 centres in Ireland providing cardiac rehabilitation services nationally. Recommendations from &ldquo;Changing Cardiovascular Health National Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010 &ndash; 2019&rdquo; recognised a need to establish or redirect services to address effectively the common rehabilitation goals of all cardiovascular patients. Increasing participation in chronic disease self-management programmes is central to Sl&aacute;intecare.</p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018 under the Chairmanship of Professor Phillip Nolan and a Steering Group formed from nominations of interested stakeholders representing medical, professional/technical staff, nursing and patient representatives.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Cardiac Services Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive, by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. This aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme and includes cardiac rehabilitation services in its work.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group is currently working on the development of the proposed recommendations of the draft Report with the next meeting planned for May 2022 The implementation process for the National Cardiac Services Review is also being developed as part of the process to finalise the Report. Decisions on further service developments will await the final Report and recommendations of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.</p></reply>

Given the wider &ldquo;health in all policies&rdquo; approach of Healthy Ireland, investment across multiple sectors, through Government Departments and their agencies and in wider society, all contributes to broad health and wellbeing in line with the Healthy Ireland Framework.</p><p>The funding for Health and Wellbeing in my Department currently and over the last five years, is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Amount (&euro;mil)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td>5.9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td>5.6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>7.5 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>7.33 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>12.45 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 </td>       <td>15.39 </td>    </tr> </table> *To note the amounts above do not include the spend by the HSE on health and wellbeing services within the community and acute settings.  </p><p>The &euro;15.39 million budget for 2022 covers actions that support local communities, including the Healthy Ireland Fund and the new Sl&aacute;intecare Healthy Communities Programme.  Funding is allocated for National programmes including Age Friendly Ireland, Sport Ireland and the Healthy Ireland at Your Library programme.  The allocation will also be used to empower citizens to adopt healthier behaviours through various citizen engagement campaigns.  The Healthy Ireland Survey and a contribution toward the Health Behaviour in School Aged Children is also funded from this budget.  Several settings-based initiatives are funded, including Healthy Campuses, Workplaces and Clubs.  Finally, the allocation will be utilised to develop various guidelines and policies, including Healthy Eating guidelines and Mental Health Promotion. </p><p>There is overwhelming evidence that investment in prevention is cost-effective in both the short and longer term. In addition, investing in public health generates cost-effective health outcomes and can contribute to wider sustainability, with economic, social and environmental benefits.  Healthy Ireland is a core framework for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and provides the central platform to address the social determinants of health that impact how well people live their lives.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-26a.3718.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022042600119#WROOO04300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1386 to 1388, inclusive, 1434, 1449, 1503, 1530, 1547 and 1694 together.</p><p>Secondments within and across the civil and public service are a long-standing, valuable and useful practice.  They encourage the sharing of experience and learning across the public sector and provide excellent development opportunities for civil and public servants to better serve the public interest.</p><p>My Department does not comment on specific contractual matters for individual employees but as of 25th April 2022, 14 of the Department&rsquo;s employees in various grades from Clerical Officer through to Principal Officer are seconded to other organisations. The duration of these secondments varies between six months and five years, with some having provision for renewal if agreed between the Department, the host organisation and the secondee.  These arrangements include the National Economic &amp;amp; Social Council, Department of Defence, Department of the Taoiseach, Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Education, Central Statistics Office, Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  There are a variety of ways in which secondments out of the Department arise.  Some arise from advertisements by host organisations, some (e.g. the secondment of Department of Health staff to the Permanent Representation in Brussels) are a matter for the Department to determine through its own internal processes.  In some situations, arrangements will be made for individual employees with particular skills and experience to second to another Department by agreement between the two Departments concerned.  </p><p>  Where an individual is seconded to another civil service organisation, in line with the secondment policy for the civil service they would normally transfer to the payroll of the host organisation for administrative efficiency reasons.  Some specific schemes such as NEPT placements with the EU institutions and coordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs, would involve the Department covering the payroll and associated costs of an employee working temporarily with the EU.</p><p>  Secondees retain the term and conditions of their employment including pension rights.  No person currently seconded out from the Department has formally relinquished their employment within the Department and would therefore be expected to return to a role in the Department when their secondment is complete.  It is not unusual, however, for secondees to secure a promotion or move to new employment while seconded out which means they do not ultimately return.</p><p>  There are a large variety of arrangements, some long-standing, for those seconded into my Department.  At the present time there are 53 people seconded into the Department of Health from other organisations. These can be on the basis of an advertisement of the available secondment to the civil or public service, in particular the health service, as appropriate.  In some cases they arise from long-standing arrangements (e.g. with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Central Statistics Office) for the placement of staff with the Department based on specific required expertise, or where specific health service employees are seconded in to work with the Department on particular projects. </p><p>  Secondees into the Department are from a range of organisations including the Departments of Finance, Justice, Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment and Transport; other civil service organisations including the Central Statistics Office, Office of the Attorney General, the Revenue Commissioners, Office of the Information Commissioner, the Courts Service, the National Shared Services Office and the Office of Government Procurement; various bodies under the aegis of the Department including the HSE, various section 38 bodies funded by the HSE, a number of health sector regulatory bodies and other public sector bodies such as Tusla.  </p><p>  For those seconded in, payment arrangements generally involve a recoupment by the Department of the pay and pension costs involved to the parent organisation or in respect of the civil service, by the transfer of the individual to the Department&rsquo;s payroll.  In some cases, where a specific project requires the individual to work closely with the Department&rsquo;s staff to advance a particular policy on a partnership basis, no recoupment to the parent organisation is being made.  </p><p>I have asked the HSE to collate the information and respond directly to the Deputy in relation to its own employees.</p></reply>

This included the capital costs for the main hospital at St James's Hospital campus, the two satellite centres, equipment for the three sites, and the construction of the carpark and retail spaces. The capital budget has not yet been depleted and to date, &euro;964.1m of the &euro;1.433bn budget has been drawn down for works on the project across the three sites.</p>  <p>   There are a number of items not included in this investment figure as there was no price certainly for them and nor can there be, for some, for the duration of the project. These include construction inflation, the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes, any change in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes, and the Employment Order.</p>  <p>   Additional costs in relation to the integration and transfer of the services of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals to the new sites brings the total programme cost to &euro;1.73bn. This includes investment in ICT, a new Electronic Health Record system, and the Children's Hospital Integration Programme (the merging of three paediatric hospitals) including commissioning.</p>  <p>   Brexit, the pandemic and recent geopolitical developments have severely impacted supply chains and the NCH project is not immune to these external challenges. Every effort is being taken to mitigate the risks but these externalities beyond the control of the contractor and the NPHDB make speculation and more definitive forecasting unwise.</p>  <p>   The construction contract between the NPHDB and the main contractor permits the contractor to recover the cost of national construction inflation in excess of 4% and this came into effect from August 2019. Inflation above 4%, as defined by the average of three defined tender price indices, can be claimed for annually, on a compound basis, based upon the revised contract amount.</p>  <p>   The NPHDB has statutory responsibility for planning, designing, building, and equipping the new children's hospital. This includes assessment and defence of claims/disputes submitted by the contractor under the construction contract and certification of contractual payments to date.  I have therefore referred these elements of your question to the NPHDB for direct reply.</p></reply>

These priorities strengthen the health-led approach, reflect commitments in the Programme for Government and align with the EU drugs strategy and action plan 2021-2025.</p>  <p>  The strategic implementation groups are responsible for driving the implementation of the strategic priorities - developing an action plan, strengthening the links with local services, improving performance and promoting good practice. The groups have an independent chair, who is also a member of the national oversight committee, and a membership comprised of representatives from Government departments and agencies, drug and alcohol taskforces and civil society. They have between 10 and 12 members who reflect the partnership model underlying the national drugs strategy. The groups will operate for four years, until 2025. </p>  <p>  The new structures will reflect the partnership approach and broaden and deepen the involvement of community and voluntary groups in the implementation of the strategy.</p>  <p>  The Department is finalising the membership of each group, including representatives of civil society, following a call for expressions of interest. It is expected that the chairs of each group will convene a meeting of their group before the end of May. </p>  <p>  I am committed to implementing the strategic priorities for the national drugs strategy in partnership with statutory bodies, civil society organisations and independent expertise.</p></reply>

In accordance with the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The HSE assesses each application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax; PRSI and the Universal Social Charge (USC) have been deducted. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which helps to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  Regarding persons aged 70 or older, the medical card assessment is based on gross income. This assessment process was introduced for this cohort only, by way of the Health Act 2008, as a means to replace the automatic entitlement to a medical card for people aged 70 years and over.  The new gross income arrangements were therefore introduced on that basis and provided for the vast majority of people aged 70 years and over to continue to hold medical cards under the new income thresholds. The weekly gross income thresholds for eligibility to a medical card for those aged 70 and over were increased in November 2020 and are currently &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1050 for a couple.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that persons aged 70 or older may also have their eligibility assessed under the general means tested medical card scheme in the event that they face particularly high expenses, e.g. nursing home or medication costs.</p></reply>

The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>Waiting list reductions and maximum waiting time targets apply to all acute hospital scheduled care active waiting lists. The HSE is engaged with hospital groups in a process to focus on specialties and procedures towards which the waiting list fund needs to be specifically directed to ensure the targets are achieved by year end.</p><p>">Waiting Lists</p></reply>

Eligibility guidelines for this payment, as applies in HSE and Section 38 organisations, were published by the HSE on 19th April and are available at www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p><p>Separately, the Department of Health shall shortly publish information for those other certain healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>- Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>- Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>- Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>- Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>- Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in the HSE;</p><p>- Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage</p><p>I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day. </p><p>Outside of the above recognition measures, the Government also notes that some private sector healthcare employers have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic. The Government would encourage private sector healthcare employers that have not already done so to consider appropriate measures to recognise their own frontline workers for their work during this most trying period.</p></reply>

This will set out ways to advance a commitment to have 750 annual public service-wide apprentice registrations by 2025.  The Department of Health is represented on this group. </p>  <p>  As part of this work, over 100 civil and public service organisations have recently been surveyed for their views on apprenticeship and their skills needs. Following on from this, the Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan is currently under development, in partnership with a comprehensive range of civil and public service stakeholders, including this department. It is anticipated to be finalised before September 2022. </p>  <p>  From a health perspective, there has already been keen interest expressed in developing an apprenticeship for Healthcare Assistants. My officials are liaising with relevant counterparts in the HSE, in collaboration with DFHERIS, with this concept in mind for further exploration for development, along with several other apprenticeship projects under consideration.</p></reply>

The two centres at Connolly and Tallaght are now operational,  the centre at Tallaght having opened in November last year. </p>  <p>  Work on the St James&rsquo;s site is progressing well and the hospital is now clearly visible on the Dublin skyline. Major milestones were reached in 2021, which included the completion of the concrete frame with over 150,000 cubic metres of concrete poured, the topping out of the building (where the highest point on the building was completed- a significant milestone in any construction project), the infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame, the closing in of the concourse and approximately 17,000 square metres of glazing and 5,800 square metres of external fa&ccedil;ade installed.</p>  <p>  To date, 86,000 square metres of internal partitions have been installed, with the equivalent of over 26 kilometres installed in 2021. The fit out of most internal areas is now underway, including the south fingers comprising Outpatients, Cardiology Wards, and Therapies spaces and the &lsquo;Hot Block&rsquo; comprising Emergency Department, Critical Care and Theatres. Work in 2022 will be focused on the progression of the internal fit-out of the over 6,000 internal spaces. Internal fit out ranges from first fix in some areas, whereas others are much further progressed, with ceilings and joinery being fitted.</p>  <p>  The NCH was connected to a permanent supply of power from the ESB network recently, which is another important milestone in the project.</p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) has advised that the main contractor&rsquo;s current schedule outlines completion can be achieved by December 2023 which would mean the NCH at St James&rsquo;s could open in the second half of 2024, after the necessary commissioning period. The NPHDB is working to ensure that contractor will meet its own schedule.</p>  <p>  In relation to the number of beds in the new children's hospital, the Definitive Business Case for the new hospital plans for 380 inpatient beds and 93 day-care beds.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query on eating disorders, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists. Gynaecology waiting lists are a priority area of focus of this plan.</p>  <p>  The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p>  <p>  This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan. </p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p>  <p>  Waiting list reductions and maximum waiting time targets apply to all acute hospital scheduled care active waiting lists. The HSE is engaged with hospital groups in a process to focus on specialties and procedures towards which the waiting list fund needs to be specifically directed to ensure the targets are achieved by year end.</p></reply>

The issues which arise from Irish people engaging in cross-border surrogacy primarily relate to parentage, guardianship, citizenship and, potentially, adoption. International surrogacy raises complex ethical questions concerning areas of law that intersect across the remits of several Government Departments and require detailed examination. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, my colleagues Minister McEntee, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman and I submitted a joint Memorandum to Government in relation to the establishment of a time-limited Special Joint Oireachtas Committee on International Surrogacy. I have committed to having regard to the work of this Committee as the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction Bill) 2022 progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas. I will do all I can to include recommendations on international surrogacy if it is decided that it is the appropriate vehicle and if specific legislative recommendations are concluded consistent with the timeframe for the AHR Bill which deals with the regulation of domestic surrogacy.</p>  <p>  Subject to the Committee&rsquo;s findings and recommendations, it is not clear, at this juncture, whether the AHR Bill will be the appropriate vehicle for accommodating legislative proposals, or whether the amendment of other relevant legislation on the Statute Book is more appropriate. The Deputy will also appreciate that, at this time, it is also not clear if the output of the Committee&rsquo;s work will focus on legislative recommendations or other types of intervention, if any. This will only become clearer as the Committee&rsquo;s work progresses. </p>  <p>The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 passed Second Stage on March 23rd   2022 and has been referred to the Select Committee on Health for Third Stage. I am particularly determined to progress this much-needed and long-awaited piece of historic legislation as quickly as possible and avoid any further delays to a robust regulatory framework for AHR being put in place. Crucially, this would also adversely impact upon the Government&rsquo;s plans to introduce the provision of IVF and other advanced AHR treatments through the public health system. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I am fully committed to supporting the work of the Committee and having regard to its work in the context of the AHR Bill where possible and appropriate, and my officials will continue to work collaboratively with it and other relevant Departments in respect of examining the issues concerned, as it has done so to date.</p></reply>

The HSE is also looking at other options which these doctors can avail of while registration is pending, such as medical translation and access to CPD resources. </p>  <p>  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI) will ensure that as many Ukrainian applicants as possible can be fully supported to achieve recognition and registration, while at all times consistent to the organisation&rsquo;s primary functions which are to protect the public and protect the integrity of the professions.  The NMBI has engaged with the RCSI, my Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (DFHERIS) and other key stakeholders to develop an interim-orientation course to address any gaps identified during the recognition of nurses and midwives coming from Ukraine e.g. incomplete or missing transcripts of education. </p>  <p>  This orientation course would be a once-off course for approximately 3 months, including some supernumerary clinical placement time, providing orientation to nursing in Ireland.  However, it should be noted that not every Ukrainian applicant would be suitable for the programme, for example, those that do not have sufficient levels of occupational English to safely undertake the supernumerary placements.  Guidance documents are also being translated into Ukrainian to support applicants in the process. </p>  <p>  CORU, the body responsible for the regulation of certain Health and Social Care Professionals, is providing information for Ukrainian applicants on its website including a dedicated email address for queries.  </p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) that any application from an individual holding a qualification as a pharmacist obtained in the Ukraine would have the application considered under the third country recognition route via the PSI.  This would involve assessment for recognition through the third country process.</p>  <p>  The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC), the independent statutory body who sets the standards for education and training for pre-hospital emergency care in Ireland, have also recently been involved in a number of meetings with DFHERIS and the Professional Regulators Forum and the Health Care Regulators Forum.  PHECC also plans to include registration information in Ukrainian on its website.</p>  <p>  Several of the regulators have established direct contact with the Ukrainian Embassy and the Ambassador has kindly offered the support of the Embassy in acting as a liaison with Ukrainian authorities.  It is expected that some practitioners arriving from Ukraine will face difficulties in providing all the necessary documentation associated with their undergraduate education and post qualification experience as a practitioner. However, the Ukrainian Embassy in Dublin can verify or re-issue expired identification documents of Ukrainian nationals. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department will continue to liaise with the various relevant bodies to ensure that as many Ukrainian applicants as possible can be fully supported to achieve recognition and registration where possible, mindful at all times of the importance of maintaining and promoting patient safety.</p></reply>

These works comprise of relocating some SVUH departments currently on the site of the new NMH, such as the pharmacy, and diverting utilities to other locations on the SVUH campus. The pharmacy and multi-storey car park extension were completed in 2021 and both are fully operational.</p>  <p>  The requirement to replace the outdated pharmacy had been recognised for some time as part of the wider SVUH Campus Development Plan and was a necessary campus project in its own right, as well as being necessary to allow the NMH development to proceed. The original SVUH pharmacy was located on the proposed site for the new NMH and needed to be relocated, commissioned, and operationalised prior to commencement of construction of the new NMH.</p>  <p>  The new pharmacy is designed to meet current regulatory standards and includes a Pharmacy Automated Dispensing System (PADS) and  supports the implementation of the Falsified Medicines Directive, as well as bringing efficiencies to the delivery of pharmacy services for SVUH and the delivery of certain campus-wide pharmaceutical services, including the new NMH. The Pharmacy is located at roof level of the existing Main Ward Block, at the heart of the SVUH. This new central location will bring greater efficiencies in the delivery of pharmacy services within the hospital. In turn, the relocation of the pharmacy releases the existing site for of the development of the new NMH.</p>  <p>  The early programme delivery of the additional car-parking spaces and junction upgrades is a specific requirement of the Strategic Infrastructure Development (SID) planning permission, required to reduce the impact of the NMH construction works both on the operation of the campus and on the surrounding residential area. These works also unlock key elements of the campus for the Main Development works.</p>  <p>  The additional spaces arising from these works support the relocation of the NMH to the SVUH campus. In addition, the car park works help to deliver the optimum approach to efficient car parking on the campus. The car park works also provided enhanced facilities for disabled users, additional accommodation for cyclists, and general improvements to the surrounding public realm. As such it will serve the entire SVUH campus, including the new NMH.</p>  <p>  The Pharmacy and extension to existing multi storey carpark works were procured in accordance with Capital Works Management Framework guidance for public works contracts and all relevant Irish and EU procurement rules and guidelines.  The tender was advertised both on e-tenders and OJEU. It was a 2-stage tender process, and the Pharmacy/Car-park works was advertised and awarded as single tender/contract.</p></reply>

Co-location of maternity services with adult services provides mothers with access to a full range of medical and support services should the need arise, in line with international best practice. In order to be successful in terms of enabling immediate access in an emergency, co-location requires physical adjacencies and specific corridor-linkages from one hospital to the other. The availability of these services helps ensure the delivery of an optimum, safe service, particularly for high-risk mothers and babies.</p>  <p>  The 2008 KPMG report recommended that the NMH should be co-located with St Vincent&rsquo;s, the Coombe with Tallaght and the Rotunda with the Mater, tri-located with the new children&rsquo;s hospital then planned for that site. This configuration was designed to optimise access and the locations were therefore interdependent.</p>  <p>  Following the Government decision in 2012 that the new children&rsquo;s hospital would be co-located with St James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin 8, there was a need to provide for tri-location of maternity services on that site. In the context that the project to relocate the NMH to St Vincent's had commenced and a design team was in place, a review was undertaken to determine which hospital (the Coombe or Rotunda) would be tri-located with the children's hospital and St James&rsquo;s Hospital, and what the optimum location would be for the remaining hospital. The review took account of attendance patterns and access overall, as well as clinical criteria and site considerations. Further information in relation to the relocation decision is available here:</p>  <p>wayback.archive-it.org/11501/20190626194030/https://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/department-of-health-announces-sites-for-redevelopment-of-coombe-and-rotunda-hospitals/</p>  <p>  In relation to the NMH, co-location with SVUH will make the wide range of general medical, surgical and diagnostic facilities on the Elm Park campus available to any woman who needs to be transferred from the adjacent maternity hospital, resulting in care provision that is far superior to the existing situation. This co-location will also build on the longstanding working relationship between the NMH and SVUH, given that a significant proportion of the consultant staff at the NMH are employed by and work between the two hospitals.</p></reply>

Site preparatory and enabling works were required to support the relocation of the new NMH.</p>  <p>  These preparatory works commenced on the campus in early 2018 with a programme of Aspergillus prevention works. Construction of the new pharmacy and the multi-storey car-park were completed in 2021 and both are fully operational. The costs of all works to date are &euro;51m (including VAT).</p>  <p>  With the exception of the construction works referenced above, no further contractual commitments have been entered into with respect to works to the new NMH project.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that all capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages, in line with the Public Spending Code, before a firm timeline or funding requirement can be established.</p>  <p>  A Final business case has been submitted to the Department by the NMH Project Board and is now subject to technical review by the Department of Health, including the External Assurance Process for major capital projects recently introduced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Pending favourable review under the Spending Code, a Memorandum for Government will then be brought forward to progress the programme for the NMH. If approval in principle is granted, the project can move to preparation of tender documents in line with EU law and deployment of a tendering strategy.</p>  <p>  The final decision to proceed with the construction and therefore to estimate the cost for the new NMH cannot be made until the tender process has been completed and the costings reviewed to ensure that the proposal delivers value for money and remains affordable.</p></reply>

It provides information on alcohol, tobacco, and drug use amongst the general population in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The survey findings show that, overall, the use of illegal drugs has remained similar to that recorded in the 2014/15. Cannabis which is still the most prevalent illegal drug used in Ireland, has shown a decrease from 6.5% to 5.9% when compared to the 2014/15 survey. However there was an increase in the use of cocaine and ecstasy.</p>  <p>  The national drug strategy, Reducing Harm Supporting Recovery, strategy provides an integrated public health approach to drug and alcohol use, focused on reducing the harms for individuals, families and communities and promoting rehabilitation and recovery. The recently completed mid-term review of the drug strategy shows significant progress in implementing the action plan for the period 2017 to 2020, with only a small number of the 50 actions outstanding.</p>  <p>  Six strategic priorities have been identified for the remaining years of the strategy. The first strategic priority aims to strengthen the prevention of drug and alcohol use and the associated harms among children and young people.</p>  <p>  Access and availability of drug services have been improved under the national drugs strategy, particularly services for women and people who are homeless, and those with heroin addiction. The Department provides over &euro;150 million to provide drug and alcohol services every year.</p>  <p>  Significant additional funding was provided to the HSE to provide for drug treatment services in 2020 and 2021. In 2021, a further &euro;4.2 million was secured for the continued treatment of an additional 1,000 clients on opioid substitution treatment.</p>  <p>  I am committed to the implementation of the health led approach to drug use and to supporting people on their journey to recovery.</p></reply>

The Department of Health provides over &euro;130 million to drug and alcohol services to support the strategy.</p><p>The Department currently provides &euro;29 million to the 24 Drug and Alcohol Task Forces to deliver community-based drug and alcohol services in local communities. The Task Forces support over 280 community projects throughout the country to tackle drug and alcohol use and misuse. A table detailing the funding to each Task Force in 2021 is attached.</p><p>Drug and alcohol task forces play a key role in implementing the national drugs strategy at the local level. They assess the extent and nature of the drug problem and initiate appropriate responses, so that there is a coordinated approach involving all sectors to the problem of substance misuse in local communities and local communities are consulted in the design and deliver services.</p><p>As part of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, a focused policy assessment of expenditure on drugs and alcohol services was carried out by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES), examining new data on trends and indicators in drug and alcohol for 2019/2020, and the impact of Covid-19 on drug and alcohol services. Further information is available at: assets.gov.ie/193826/4cea8a19-f991-4f92-8237-ee9fd1bf70ee.pdf.</p><p>HSE addiction services are responsible for the provision of opioid substitution treatment. Opioid substitution treatment supports patients to recover from drug dependence. HSE addiction services work within the national drugs rehabilitation framework to support progression pathways. The framework ensures that individuals affected by drug misuse are offered a range of integrated options tailored to meet their needs and to create rehabilitation pathways. The HSE implements an opioid treatment protocol, so as to provide appropriate and timely substance treatment and rehabilitation services tailored to individual needs.</p><p>There are over 11,000 on opioid substitution treatment, with an additional 1,000 clients given access to OST in 2020 and 2021 under the Covid-19 contingency plan for people who use drugs.</p><p>There is international research evidence that increased length of time in Opioid Substitution Treatment is associated with improved treatment outcomes and short-term methadone maintenance treatment is associated with poorer outcomes.</p><p>I believe that methadone treatment reflects the public health approach to drug and alcohol misuse set out in the National Drugs Strategy. It is an important tool to reduce harm and to aid people on their journey to recovery from drug use. I am committed to improving the availability of this treatment and to supporting service users to access progression pathways.</p><p>Allocations to Drug and Alcohol Task Forces by the Department of Health and the HSE -2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>LDATF</th>       <th>2021 DOH</th>       <th>2021 HSE</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballyfermot</td>       <td>&euro;255,446</td>       <td>&euro;1,241,286</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ballymun</td>       <td>&euro;422,958</td>       <td>&euro;707,957</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Blanchardstown</td>       <td>&euro;179,305</td>       <td>&euro;923,589</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bray</td>       <td>&euro;573,860</td>       <td>&euro;926,271</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Canal Communities</td>       <td>&euro;338,605</td>       <td>&euro;1,151,309</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clondalkin</td>       <td>&euro;388,114</td>       <td>&euro;1,017,948</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>&euro;57,588</td>       <td>&euro;1,472,699</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin 12</td>       <td>&euro;70,397</td>       <td>&euro;1,003,750</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin NE</td>       <td>&euro;239,971</td>       <td>&euro;787,116</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>D&uacute;n Laoghaire</td>       <td>&euro;94,676</td>       <td>&euro;796,755</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Finglas Cabra</td>       <td>&euro;263,277</td>       <td>&euro;637,960</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>NIC</td>       <td>&euro;394,856</td>       <td>&euro;1,844,723</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SIC</td>       <td>&euro;176,043</td>       <td>&euro;1,878,014</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tallaght</td>       <td>&euro;336,022</td>       <td>&euro;908,930</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total LDATF</td>       <td>&euro;3,791,118</td>       <td>&euro;15,298,307</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>RDATF</td>       <td>2021 DOH</td>       <td>2021 HSE</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>East Coast Area</td>       <td>&euro;58,200</td>       <td>&euro;518,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Midland</td>       <td>&euro;4,000</td>       <td>&euro;805,307</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mid-West</td>       <td>&euro;147,982</td>       <td>&euro;1,270,007</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>North East</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;937,813</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>North West</td>       <td>&euro;258,633</td>       <td>&euro;471,730</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>North Dublin City &amp;amp; Co.</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;787,264</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South East</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;1,075,760</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South West</td>       <td>&euro;102,820</td>       <td>&euro;706,497</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Southern</td>       <td>&euro;0</td>       <td>&euro;983,178</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Western</td>       <td>&euro;136,994</td>       <td>&euro;534,155</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total RDATF</td>       <td>&euro;708,629</td>       <td>&euro;8,090,211</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Overall Total</td>       <td></td>       <td>&euro;27,888,265</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The model of care for infertility was developed by my officials in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme in order to ensure that infertility issues are addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.</p>  <p>  This model of care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs), extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments), with patients being referred onwards through structured pathways.</p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs within maternity networks, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues at this level of intervention. The completion of Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system, but will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country, required resources have been allocated and the AHR legislation commenced.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy might be aware the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 23rd March 2022 and has been referred to the Select Committee on Health for Third Stage. I am fully committed to progressing this important legislation as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  While advanced AHR treatment, such as IVF, is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client's nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I understand that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF, or other advanced AHR treatment, privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the model of care for infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.</p></reply>

One of the central priorities for me as Minister for Health is that waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures are improved, and that children receive the care that they need and deserve in a timely and appropriate fashion. In particular, a special area of focus for me and my Department is that of paediatric orthopaedics.</p><p>In January I asked the HSE to develop a dedicated plan to tackle scoliosis waiting lists this year.  In early February I met with senior officials of Children&rsquo;s Heath Ireland (CHI) and the HSE, as well as senior orthopaedic clinicians from Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh, to discuss the finalisation of the proposals to increase orthopaedic activity at CHI. The plan proposes ambitious additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures (scoliosis and spina bifida) by year end.</p><p>This latest initiative is further evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to address the issues facing these children. Both current and capital funding has been provided to a value of &euro;19 million in 2022 to support this initiative.</p><p>More specifically, &euro;3.4 million has been committed to support additional activity at Cappagh Orthopaedic hospital. This is the full year requirement associated with the &euro;1.65 million that was provided from the Access to Care Fund in 2021 to support CHI paediatric orthopaedic activity at Cappagh. Furthermore, &euro;4.7 million has been provided on a recurring basis since 2021 to fund an additional 24 beds at Crumlin and Temple street, and 2 high dependency unit beds at Crumlin. These beds will facilitate the increase in activity needed to reduce paediatric orthopaedic waiting times. A further &euro;4 million has been committed for a theatre expansion programme across CHI sites to focus on paediatric orthopaedics. Capital funding of &euro;4 million has been designated to support this initiative, which is included within the 2022 Capital Plan due to be approved shortly. Finally, &euro;2 million has been provided for outsourcing initiatives for both inpatient and daycase procedures, as well as to meet radiology needs. Plans are currently being finalised by CHI in this regard.</p><p>Further details of the breakdown of these funds are provided for the Deputy in the attached document. Some of these figures are initial estimates and as such are subject to final review, agreement and potential revision on receipt of the detailed operational plan for delivery of this important initiative.</p><p>">WaitingLists</p></reply>

On 18 September 2020, the NCPE completed its assessment and recommended that Voretigene neparvovec not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p><p>The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the applicant company in November 2020.</p><p>The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members and clinicians.</p><p>The HSE Drugs Group considered Voretigene neparvovec at its February 2021 meeting, and requested Patient and Clinician Engagement input via the Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) to assist the group in making its recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) regarding reimbursement of Voretigene neparvovec.</p><p>The HSE has advised that, on 23 March 2021, the RDTRC held a meeting at which Voretigene neparvovec was the main agenda point.</p><p>The Committee met on 26 August and concluded its patient and clinician engagement with respect to Voretigene neparvovec. The Committee submitted a statement in December regarding this review for the Drugs Group&rsquo;s consideration.</p><p>The Drugs Group has specifically requested a Prescribing Guideline to inform their deliberations. This guideline is currently under development. The Drugs Group will review the output of the RDTRC and the Prescribing Guideline with a view to making a recommendation at the earliest opportunity to the HSE EMT.</p><p>The HSE EMT is the decision-making body for the reimbursement of medicines under the Health Act 2013 and it will, following receipt of the outcome of the HSE Drugs Group's deliberations, make the decision on whether Voretigene neparvovec will be reimbursed.</p></reply>

There are currently 132 participants at various stages of onboarding, including 24 who have completed each of the stages and are in receipt of a Personalised Budget. </p>  <p>  The pilot is running behind schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the closure of services and has made it difficult to recruit staff for the HSE team. COVID-19 restrictions also severely impacted the HSE&rsquo;s ability to meet with individuals to progress their applications.</p>  <p>  A Personalised Budget is an amount of funding for an eligible person with a disability so that the individual can make their own arrangements to meet specified support needs. This is instead of having their needs met directly for them by the State.</p>  <p>  The report of the Task Force on Personalised Budgets was launched by Minister McGrath in July 2018. The report set out how Personalised Budgets could work as a funding mechanism for people with a disability. Personalised Budgets can help to provide people with disabilities with greater choice and control over the services and supports they receive.</p>  <p>  The Task Force reviewed national and international research and consulted with service users and their families. They recommended that the Department of Health, with the HSE, should establish a pilot project to test the delivery of personalised budgets - the aim being to identify the best approach to roll-out Personalised Budgets following this pilot phase</p>  <p>  Funding can be spent on specific personal supports funded by the HSE such as employing your own support worker or having support staff at a time you choose. These supports are agreed and identified in a personal support plan for each participant.</p>  <p>  Funding cannot be spent on informal care from a partner or close relative or to pay for supports that would normally be provided by another Government Department or Statutory Agency, e.g. housing.</p>  <p>  It is hoped that the pilot will have up to 180 participants over two phases who access a wide range of HSE funded services including residential, rehabilitative training, personal assistance and day services.</p></reply>

I have also approved the reintroduction of Scale and Polish for medical card patients on the DTSS. These new measures are designed to address access problems for patients, and address dentist&rsquo;s concerns about the viability of the DTSS, while aligning the DTSS more closely with the Dental Treatment Benefits Scheme, which is widely operated by private dentists for PRSI patients.</p>  <p>  These measures should amount to an additional investment this year of about &euro;26 million over what was spent on the Scheme in 2021. My Department and the HSE will work together to quickly implement the changes to the Scheme for the benefit of patients.</p></reply>

Delivering this enhanced capacity requires substantial recruitment. This has been affected due to the strategic workforce challenges in the home support sector. An Advisory Group has been set up and has already met, to identify the specific obstacles to recruiting carers, and make recommendations to me by this September.</p><p>It is important to note that progress is being made in this area - at the end of February 2022 there were 4,567 people assessed and waiting for a carer to become available. This is a reduction from January, when 4,836 were waiting for a carer to become available. </p><p>At the end of February 286 were awaiting processing of funding approval, which is a slight increase from 273 in January. It is important to note there will always be new applications being processed &ndash; this is not a funding issue.</p><p>The total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to 4,853 by the end of February 2022.</p><p>Regarding your specific question on home support in Co Kerry, this is an operational matter and we have referred it to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to you.</p><p>In addition, you may be interested to know that I have established a cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group to examine strategic workforce challenges in front-line carer roles in home support and nursing homes in Ireland.  </p><p>This got underway with a 'Call for Submissions', in December 2021 which issued by the Department to relevant stakeholders.</p><p>Following receipt of these completed submissions in January, Department officials undertook a short-life scoping exercise to gather initial data and evidence on the nature and extent of the challenges in the sector to inform the structure and membership of this cross-departmental Group.</p><p>On completion of the scoping exercise, the inaugural meeting of this Group was held on 3rd March, 2022.</p><p>The Group is presently working with key sectoral stakeholders in a structured programme of ongoing consultative engagements to further explore and define the issues. </p><p>Areas being considered by the Group include recruitment, retention, training, pay and conditions, and the career development of front-line carers in home support and nursing homes into the future. </p><p>The Group provides a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address the workforce challenges in the sector nationwide and will develop a report for my consideration outlining the key findings, recommendations, and a proposed action plan to support implementation of these recommendations.</p></reply>

It must also be ensured that they do not cause any unintentional consequences for existing public order laws.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, while it was originally intended to provide for safe access to termination of pregnancy services in the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, a number of complex legal and policy issues were identified during the drafting process which necessitated further deliberation and advice. These issues were further debated in the Seanad during the second, third and fourth stages for the Safe Access to Termination of Pregnancy Services Bill 2021, and I wish to commend the Together for Safety group for its work on this legislative proposal which is further informing necessary considerations in this important area of work. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are actively engaging with key stakeholders to work through these challenges, refine the policy position, and explore legislative options. At my request, and with the support of the Joint Committee on Health, officials met the Health Committee in March to collaboratively discuss options for overcoming the challenges that have been identified by the Department. I understand that this was a positive session, with the Committee voicing their support for bringing forward safe access legislation. I wish to thank the Committee for their time and input to support the advancement of robust legislation for safe access zones. It is important to me that the appropriate legislative solution is progressed with cross party support. My officials have listened carefully to the views and inputs of the Committee and will consider these into their ongoing work on this matter. </p>  <p>  My Department is now settling the policy position, which is complex, and officials are continuing to work with an inter-departmental working group to advance these proposals and develop a robust General Scheme of a Bill. </p>  <p>Subject to Government approval, I plan to have proposals for safe access on the legislative programme for 2022.  </p></reply>

I would also like to assure your constituent and their daughter that I fully empathise with the difficulties they have faced. The COVID-19 pandemic has been an extraordinarily challenging time, causing untold difficulties for people across the country since its onset. While I am not in a position to comment on individual cases, I would like to wish your constituent and their daughter a full and speedy recovery. With respect to the care required going forward, the medical team currently involved in the case are best placed to advise on the most appropriate course of treatment.</p>  <p>  Regarding the medical expenses regrettably incurred, the Department of Health is exploring the possibility of a broader vaccine compensation scheme, not specific to COVID-19. Unfortunately, there is still significant work required in this area.</p>  <p>  With respect to vaccine safety, I can assure you that Health Products Regulation Authority (HPRA) maintains a very close watch on reported adverse reactions. In its most recent vaccine safety update (published 24th March) it noted that, whilst not experienced by everyone, all vaccines have some side effects, the vast majority of which are mild to moderate in nature. These side effects need to be continuously balanced against the benefits in preventing COVID-19 illness. Overall, the national reporting experience continues to support the favourable assessment that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the risks. This, of course, does not detract from the adverse reaction your constituent experienced but I hope that it goes some way to assure you that the vaccine is safe and that we should continue to have confidence in it.</p></reply>

In order to protect patients, it has a responsibility to ensure that all doctors registered to practise medicine in Ireland meet the requirements to practise as set out in its legislation.</p>  <p>   Pathways for registration with the Medical Council do not differ based on a doctors nationality but rather on the country they received their primary qualifications and based on their experience and higher/specialist  training. A non-EU/EEA applicant for registration must have received their primary medical qualification from a recognised medical school as identified by the World Federation for Medical Education which currently recognises eight medical schools in Mongolia.</p>  <p>   A doctor can visit the Medical Council website and use the eligibility chart to determine which division of the medical register they are able to apply for registration with based on their qualifications and experience. This chart will also let the doctor know if they must complete any pre-registration exams.</p>  <p>   Depending on where a doctor qualified and the type of qualifications they hold, some doctors arriving into Ireland from outside the EU may be required to take a pre-registration exam and provide evidence of proficiency in English, often through an English language exam. The pre-registration exams look at a number of areas including communication skills and clinical skills. This is an important step to ensure patient safety. The requirements for registration are set out in legislation and are in place for patient safety purposes.</p></reply>

Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists. </p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force.

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists. </p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health.

These health inequalities are rooted in the social determinants of health, which encompass poverty and social exclusion, poor living conditions, low education attainment, unemployment and discrimination. In addition, Travellers can face difficulties in accessing healthcare services. </p><p>The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) is the Government policy framework for addressing the health and other needs of Travellers. It contains over 30 health-related actions across four themes. The Dept of Health and the HSE are represented on the steering committee for NTRIS and report on a regular basis on the various health actions. </p><p>A key health action in National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (#73) is to develop and implement a detailed action plan to address the specific health needs of Travellers, using a social determinants approach. The lead role in developing the action plan rests with the HSE, in conjunction with Traveller organisations. The HSE established a steering committee, which included relevant stakeholders and representatives of Traveller organisations, to finalise the development of a Traveller Health Action Plan, to address the specific health needs of Travellers, be it physical, mental and social well-being needs.</p><p>Covid-19 has brought into focus the health inequalities faced by Traveller communities, and from the outset, the Government has recognised the increased risks facing this community.  A range of additional measures were put in place to support the Traveller community during the Covid crisis by local authorities and the HSE. The new Traveller Health Action Plan reflect the lessons from the public health response to Covid-19.  </p><p>  The finalisation and publication of the National Traveller Health Action Plan (NTHAP) is a priority area for action in the HSE Service Plan for 2022. As an initial step towards implementing the plan, the Department provided &euro;270,000 to expand Traveller health units in 2021. Further measures will be considered in the context of Budget 2023.</p><p>The Department of Health is fully committed to providing the leadership and resources to ensure the implementation of the Traveller health action plan, once agreed.</p></reply>

This funding supports all aspects of the current Strategy (www.hrb.ie/strategy-2025/), which is designed to address current national and European health policy objectives. In 2022, the total recurrent allocation is &euro;35.85 million and the total capital allocation is &euro;10 million. It is not unusual for some additional funding to be allocated to themed or targeted initiatives. Some examples include:</p><p>- Funding that was provided to the HRB to support the Government response to Covid-19, including for a national covid biobank, participation in the WHO Solidarity trial for Covid-19 treatments and a series of supports for Expert Advisory Group on Rapid Antigen Testing;</p><p>- Targeted funding to support the National Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), valued at &euro;1.5m per annum;</p><p>- Funding of &euro;400K per annum to conduct research to support the National Drugs Strategy;</p><p>- Funding in 2022 to advance research and research capacity building aligned with Sharing the Vision, the National Mental health strategy. </p><p>Such targeted initiatives are typically identified for additional funding by the Department of Health to support the policy priorities of the Department, as well as wider Government commitments. </p><p><b>Application Processes for Health Research Board Awards</b></p><p>The HRB has rigorous, transparent policies and processes in relation to both the application for, and assessment of, research awards. All applications for HRB funding are subject to international peer review, and the outcome of any application process is never predetermined. The HRB provides funding through several funding instruments (projects and programmes, individual or group-based career awards, funding for networks, research infrastructure) that are appropriate to its strategic objectives. The HRB strives for a balanced portfolio of awards that address its five-year strategic plan along with the needs of the Irish health and research and innovation systems. The design, objectives, funding envelope, eligibility criteria and desired outcome of funding schemes must be approved by the HRB Executive and Board before they are opened to applicants. </p><p>For health researchers wishing to access HRB funding support, there are different ways in which applications for funding are invited, depending on the nature of the scheme/objective topic.  The vast majority of HRB funding involves an open competition. However, because Ireland is a small country, it is sometimes practical to make just one award for a national consortium or national research programme in a particular area to avoid duplication of effort or research. For example, the HRB funds just one, national network to support public, patient, and carer involvement in research. In this case the universities were invited to work together to submit one application and, as with all applications to the HRB, this single application was subject to international peer review. </p><p>In addition to the review of any application, an award can only be made to a recognised HRB Host Institution that can comply with HRB Grant Terms and Conditions. To achieve/retain Host Institution status, research performing institutions must apply to the HRB by completing a detailed application and providing supporting financial and policy documentation and this must be approved to the Executive Team.  </p><p>Detailed guidance notes are provided for applicants for each funding scheme that set out the scope, objectives, eligibility and assessment criteria, the expected contribution of partners and co-applicants, budget availability (and requirements for co-funding where appropriate), award duration, governance requirements, and knowledge transfer and dissemination requirements, public/patient involvement, open access to outputs/data, and other matters as appropriate. These factors are assessed in a robust and systematic way throughout the review process. </p><p><b>Health Research Board Governance Structures</b></p><p>The HRB Board ensures the highest standards of governance to manage all aspects of its business, achieve its mission and objectives, and to meet the necessary standards of accountability, integrity, and propriety. It complies fully with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies. </p><p>The work and practices of the HRB are subject to an annual audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The HRB has pro-actively participated in a number of Organisational Reviews by international panels in recent decades to ensure that its policies, practices and procedures remain fit-for purpose and aligned with best international practice. The HRB is an active member of Science Europe, the association representing major public organisations that fund or perform excellent, ground-breaking research in Europe. </p><p>As the HRB is a publicly-funded organisation, there is an onus to account to Government and the public, for the funds allocated and the returns on that investment. The HRB maintains an Evaluation Strategy and this comprises (i) ongoing monitoring and review of all awards through annual reports and interim reviews, (ii) the collection of a detailed set of evaluation metrics, based on the Payback Framework of Buxton and Hanney, at the end of all awards and (iii) periodic reviews/evaluations of particular initiatives, scheme or fields of research (the most recent evaluation report may be viewed here: Outputs, outcomes, and emerging impacts: Results from HRB-funded awards that completed in 2018&ndash;19). Finally, the Research Strategy and Funding Directorate of the HRB has a suite of policies that it keeps under regular review, to underpin all aspects of its work, from application review to award management.</p><p>All HRB policies referenced in this response are fully available at the Health Research Board website: Home (hrb.ie). This information includes a list of open and closed funding schemes, a full description of how to access funding applications, the names and affiliations of review panels, and a list of funded awards.</p></reply>

The pilot also seeks to determine the costs associated with each model, including new or additional costs associated with administering Personalised Budgets, the impact of changes in the delivery of services on providers, and aggregate impact on the delivery of the system of Disability Services.

The Government are sincerely grateful for this commitment, and it is very difficult to draw a line on this matter, but it is appropriate that in particular public sector frontline healthcare workers, and private sector frontline nursing home and hospice workers, get particular recognition from the Government.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc or St. Brigid's Day.</p>  <p>  Outside of the above recognition measures, the Government also notes that some private healthcare companies have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic. The Government would encourage private healthcare providers that have not already done so to consider appropriate measures to recognise their own frontline workers for their work during this most trying period.</p></reply>

I have met directly with Nursing Homes Ireland, the representative organisation for private and voluntary nursing homes, to discuss this issue, and have written to the National Treatment Purchase Fund to request that they consider the matter alongside departmental officials.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.</p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.04 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.</p>  <p>  The department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.</p>  <p>  To continue the substantial progress being made on implementing the recommendations of the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel report, nearly &euro;18 million euro was allocated in Budget 2022 including investment in Community Support Teams and Safeguarding supports.</p>  <p>  Finally, in response to the strategic workforce challenges in the nursing home and home care sector, a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group has been established. The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations to me by September 2022.</p></reply>

Draft regulations under section 13 are currently being developed.   </p>  <p>  In relation to section 12 of the Act, Ireland is required to notify the draft regulations to the European Commission under the Food Information to Consumers Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011. This Regulation establishes the general principles, requirements and responsibilities governing food information and in particular food labelling. </p>  <p>  On receipt of the notification, the Commission shall consult the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health if it considers such consultation to be useful or if a Member State so requests. The Member State notifying the draft regulations may take the envisaged measures only 3 months after the notification, provided that it has not received a negative opinion from the Commission. However, if the Commission&rsquo;s opinion is negative, and before the expiry of the 3 month period, the Commission shall initiate an examination procedure in order to determine whether the envisaged measures may be implemented subject, if necessary, to the appropriate modifications. </p>  <p>  In relation to section 13 of the Act, Ireland is required to notify the draft regulations to the European Commission under the Single Market Transparency Directive (EU) 2015/1535. Once notified, a 3-month standstill period is triggered during which the Commission and other Member States assess the draft regulations in the context of Single Market principles. </p>  <p>  This Directive enables the Commission, EU Member States and participating countries to react to any potential barriers to the free movement of products and the provision of information society services; reactions can take one of the following forms:</p>  <p>  - The Commission, the EU Member States and the other participating countries can issue &lsquo;comments&rsquo; to be taken into account by the country that has notified a draft rule or rules, if the notified draft needs to be adjusted.</p>  <p>  - The Commission and EU Member States can also send the notifying Member State a &lsquo;detailed opinion&rsquo; if a serious concern is identified. This extends the standstill period and opens a dialogue phase with the notifying country. The potential barrier identified can thus be effectively addressed.</p>  <p>  - If an EU proposal in the same area is in the pipeline, the Commission can take a &lsquo;blocking decision&rsquo; to postpone the adoption of the national measure.</p>  <p>  The commencement of Section 18 which addresses alcohol advertisements in publications is subject to the commencement of all advertising sections of the Act.</p></reply>

Eligibility guidelines for this payment, as applies in HSE and Section 38 organisations, were published by the HSE on 19th April and are available at www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p><p>Separately, the Department of Health shall shortly publish information for those other certain healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>- Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.); </p><p>- Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities; </p><p>- Agency roles working in the HSE; </p><p>- Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help/home care/home support) contracted to the HSE; </p><p>- Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in the HSE; </p><p>- Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage</p><p>I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline healthcare workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day. </p><p>Outside of the above recognition measures, the Government also notes that some private sector healthcare employers have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic.

Cardiac rehabilitation is considered an essential component of secondary prevention for patients with cardiovascular disease due to the rigorous and extensive evidence base supporting its clinical effectiveness and is of importance for patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure.</p>  <p>  Cardiac Rehabilitation is specifically tailored for those with established CVD, and patient outcomes are highly dependent on the quality of CR service delivered. Cardiac Rehabilitation is delivered through four phases, from the initial cardiac event in hospital to phase four in the community. The number of patients (5,063) accessing CR in 2019 increased by 25% from 2010.  There are also ever-increasing referrals of more complex, older and frail patients with multiple comorbidities to cardiac rehabilitation programmes which, while bringing additional challenges, can result in tremendous individual gains in health and wellbeing for those patients.</p>  <p>  Recent Irish Heart Attack Audit data suggest a 71% referral rate to cardiac rehabilitation programmes.  There are at least 36 centres in Ireland providing cardiac rehabilitation services nationally. Recommendations from &ldquo;Changing Cardiovascular Health National Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010 &ndash; 2019&rdquo; recognised a need to establish or redirect services to address effectively the common rehabilitation goals of all cardiovascular patients. Increasing participation in chronic disease self-management programmes is central to Sl&aacute;intecare.</p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018 under the Chairmanship of Professor Phillip Nolan and a Steering Group formed from nominations of interested stakeholders representing medical, professional/technical staff, nursing and patient representatives.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Cardiac Services Review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive, by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. This aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme and includes cardiac rehabilitation services in its work.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group is currently working on the development of the proposed recommendations of the draft Report with the next meeting planned for May 2022 The implementation process for the National Cardiac Services Review is also being developed as part of the process to finalise the Report. Decisions on further service developments and any associated costs will await the final Report and recommendations of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services</p></reply>

Entry to these networks commenced on 1 January 2022 and represents a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service which will drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care. It is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, in 2021 I met with the HSE, NRDO and the Rare Diseases Task force which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland (RDI), the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). At this meeting priority areas for the future were discussed with a view to building further on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. A number, of priority areas for the coming period were agreed including; patient awareness, European Reference Networks, research and registries, access to services, access to medicines, diagnosis, education, legislation and policy.</p></reply>

The HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Framework Agreement with industry on the pricing and supply of medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving a company&rsquo;s pricing/reimbursement application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), whether to approve a new medicine for reimbursement.</p>  <p>  The HSE must ensure that the best possible price is achieved for new medicines as these commitments often represent multimillion-euro investments over several years. This can lead to protracted commercial negotiations.</p>  <p>  The fundamental challenge that applies to consideration of almost all new medicines in Ireland is their price and affordability in a budget-limited health service. However, the allocation of dedicated funding for new medicines has had a positive impact on the reimbursement of orphan drugs.</p>  <p>  The allocation of &euro;50m for new medicines in 2021 enabled the HSE to approve 52 new medicines/expanded uses of existing medicines in 2021, 19 of which were for the treatment of rare diseases. Budget 2022 has allocated a further &euro;30m for new medicines next year which will provide access to new innovative medicines for patients, including those with rare diseases.</p></reply>

It is relatively rare with estimations that a small proportion of ticks in Ireland are infected.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) is Ireland's specialist agency for the surveillance of communicable diseases. Lyme borreliosis is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis. The below table shows the number of notifications of Lyme disease in Ireland in each of the past 5 years. This information, including factsheets for the general public and a map of the most at risk areas can be found on the HPSC website here: www.hpsc.ie/a-z/vectorborne/lymedisease/</p><p>Lyme disease in Ireland in each of the past 5 years <table>    <tr>       <th>Lyme disease (neuroborreliosis) in Ireland </th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2021 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>The number of Lyme disease (neuroborreliosis) notifications </td>       <td>12 </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>6 </td>       <td>15 </td>       <td>4 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>The national (neuroborreliosis) notification rate per 100,000 population </td>       <td>0.3 </td>       <td>0.3 </td>       <td>0.1 </td>       <td>0.3 </td>       <td>0.08</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The infection is known to be endemic in certain locations and in these areas GPs are very familiar with the most typical presentation which is a rash, often with a bull&rsquo;s eye appearance. In this setting early treatment can be initiated by the GP and further testing is not required or recommended. More complicated cases require referral to Infectious Diseases clinics, which are currently present in all but one level 4 and all but two level 3 hospitals in Ireland.</p><p>  The Infectious Disease clinical program, which has been in place for one year, has a workforce strategy to establish a network of Infectious Diseases clinics that will address any current geographic inequity. The publicly funded Infectious Diseases clinics all support the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines regarding the diagnoses and treatment of Lyme disease. These clinics do not currently have waiting lists and patients are seen in a timely manner. Many hospital laboratories have the capacity to do Lyme serology (ELISA) locally and where not, referral of samples to the National Virus Reference Laboratory (NVRL) occurs. Confirmatory testing (western Blot) is referred to Porton Down which is the referral laboratory for the UK.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. </p>  <p>  Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.  </p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to extend the list of illnesses covered by the scheme. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, is to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs. </p>  <p>  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.  </p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.    </p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

The latest progress report, published by the Department of Health, shows that at end 2021, just four (4) out of 170 actions remain to be completed. Work is well underway in completing the four remaining actions, which are all 'in progress' and a priority focus for completion in 2022. </p>  <p>  Since Quarter 1 2019, the Department of Health has been publishing quarterly progress reports on the implementation of the recommendations made in Dr Scally&rsquo;s 2018 report; the full archive and previous quarterly progress reports are available on the Department of Health website.</p>  <p>  Dr Scally last reported on the implementation of the recommendations of his Scoping Inquiry in April 2020. In this review report, Dr Scally says that substantial progress has been made, the vast majority of actions were on track or were completed, and he is satisfied with the approach and structures in place for implementation. In addition, the CervicalCheck Steering Committee, chaired by Professor Anne Scott, and which includes representatives from 221+ Group and patient advocates in its membership have a role in oversight role in the implementation of the remaining recommendations.</p>  <p>  I have asked Dr Gabriel Scally to conduct a final progress review of implementation of the recommendations of his Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck screening programme and this is now underway. </p></reply>

Under this plan the Department, HSE, and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists. </p>  <p>  Gynaecology waiting lists are a priority area of focus of this plan. The NTPF have advised my Department that to date this year they have approved a gynaecology outpatient initiative at Ennis General Hospital which will facilitate appointments for 644 patients on gynaecology outpatient waiting lists.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Waiting List Action Plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p>  <p>  This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p></reply>

Ireland has committed to donate up to 5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and over 1.88 million of these have already been delivered, mainly through the COVAX global vaccine initiative. In addition to the already donated doses, Ireland has put forward a further 2.1 million doses for donation through COVAX. The below table sets out the vaccine doses delivered through COVAX to date. <table>    <tr>       <th>Delivery Month</th>       <th>Doses Delivered (monthly total)</th>       <th>Recipient Countries</th>       <th>Manufacturer </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>November 2021</td>       <td>496,800 </td>       <td>Nigeria </td>       <td>J&amp;amp;J/Janssen </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>December 2021</td>       <td>511,600 </td>       <td>Indonesia (235,600)<br /><br />Ghana (276,000)</td>       <td>AstraZeneca </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>January 2021</td>       <td>544,800 </td>       <td>Indonesia (168,000)<br /><br />Burkina Faso (376,800)</td>       <td>AstraZeneca (Indonesia)<br /><br />J&amp;amp;J/Janssen (Burkina Faso</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>While vaccine supply is now abundant, global vaccination rates remain too low. Almost 59% of the global adult population has been vaccinated while the average vaccination rate for countries in Africa is just 15%.  The vaccine donation landscape is becoming increasingly complex with many developing countries experiencing significant absorption, administration and hesitancy challenges that prevent matching available supply with need. </p><p>Ireland's approach to the global pandemic response focuses on the furthest behind, builds on lessons from the HIV and Ebola crises, and emphasises multilateral approaches. The pandemic response must include vaccine sharing but also enhanced investment in health system strengthening more broadly. Since the onset of the pandemic, Ireland has invested over &euro;100 million per annum in Global Health. Ireland's financial commitment includes contributions for the pandemic response, with a deliberately sustained investment in health system strengthening to combat pre-existing conditions and better prepare for and respond to new and emerging health threats.</p></reply>

I heard firsthand about the wide range of services provided for people who use drugs in the Tallaght area. I was informed about the challenges in providing community-based services for cocaine and crack cocaine users.</p>  <p>  In January 2022, I  announced &euro;850,000 in recurring funding for a HSE-led initiative to reduce the health-related harms associated with the use of cocaine and &lsquo;crack&rsquo; cocaine. This funding will support services in delivering evidence-based interventions and will increase training opportunities for staff in addiction services nationally. It will also improve the support provided to those affected by adverse health consequences of cocaine or &lsquo;crack&rsquo; cocaine use.</p>  <p>  Following a review of submissions from community healthcare organisations, the HSE has allocated funding of &euro;200,000 to CHOs 3, 4, 7 &amp;amp; 9. In CHO 7, &euro;140,000 is being allocated to establish a crack cocaine specific harm reduction service in JADD and a gender specific crack  cocaine programme in CARP.  These new services to be added to the already existing services of JADD and CARP.</p>  <p>  I welcome the engagement of community-based services and CHOs in developing these initiatives. This partnership approach is at the heart of the national drugs strategy.</p></reply>

In addition, patients who opt for private in-patient services in public hospitals are liable for a range of private in-patient charges. There are no exemptions from these charges. </p><p>The charges that apply in a private hospital are the subject of negotiation between private health insurers and the health service providers.

For the duration of the Covid-19 public health emergency, where the need for social distancing, reducing personal contacts and reducing the burden on medical practitioners are paramount, it became possible for a woman to access a termination under section 12 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 (i.e., before 12 weeks) from her medical practitioner by telephone or video conference consultation.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to monitor service provision, facilitate the smooth-running of the service and resolve any issues that may arise. However, with restrictions eased, the Department is currently reviewing whether remote consultation as part of a blended approach to termination of pregnancy care should be continued post the COVID-19 public health emergency period.</p>  <p>  At the request of the Department, the HSE conducted a review of the Revised Model of Care for Termination of Pregnancy. The findings of this review are currently being examined as part of a deliberative process. The consideration of appropriate next steps will form part of this process.</p>  <p>  It is important to reflect that COVID-19 is still with us and Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) guidance on Managing Risk of Transmission of Respiratory Viruses including COVID-19, continues to advise, amongst other things, to limit footfall in General Practice settings and support telephone consultations where care that meets the needs of the patient can be delivered - this helps to eliminate the risk of transmission of viral infection. As such the arrangements for remote access to this service in the context of COVID-19 remain in place.</p></reply>

Following intensive discussions, the audit will be undertaken as I initially sought. It will not be confined to just ADHD. An expert team, chaired by Dr Collette Halpin, has been established. The independent team is supported by the HSE National Centre for Clinical Audit. The team is finalising the process and methodology. The main Group has met on two occasions to date with a number of sub-Group meetings having also occurred. They expect to report in Quarter 4 2022.</p>  <p>  This is in addition to the implementation of all 35 recommendations made in the Maskey Report.</p>  <p>  The Chief Operating and the Chief Clinical Officer in the HSE are overseeing, monitoring and reporting on implementation. They chair an Oversight Group which has met several times already and will continue to meet regularly to ensure timely progress on implementation within an overall framework. The framework is made up of 63 actions, the majority of which have already begun to be implemented.</p>  <p>  Proposals for the audit of compliance with CAMHS operational guidelines by all CAMHS teams are being procured. Once they are assessed, a successful provider will be chosen. They will be asked to complete the audit within six months of appointment.</p>  <p>  Work is at an advanced stage on qualitative research into CAMHS experiences . The HSE is currently in discussion with an academic team to independently conduct qualitative research on service user experience of CAMHS. The purpose of this research is to determine the lived experience of patients, families, staff and GPs who all interact with CAMHS. This research will take place at a national level and is not limited to any particular diagnosis or treatment. It is anticipated that this important piece of work will commence shortly. As this is a substantial research project it is expected that initial findings will be reported to the HSE in December 2022.</p>  <p>  In parallel, the Mental Health Commission has commenced a it's own separate review relating to the Maskey Report. CAMHS teams over the past number of weeks have actively engaged with the Commission in conducting an independent review of CAMHS provision, as announced by the Commission in February last.</p></reply>

In fact, it surpasses that recommendation, delivering an increase in capacity to 446 over time.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific data requested, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Put simply, the aim of such an instrument is to protect public health and to help save lives in the event of future pandemics. </p>  <p>  An Intergovernmental Negotiating Body has been established and met for the first time on 24 February 2022. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body is due to meet again by 1 August 2022 to discuss progress on a working draft of an agreement. A progress report is expected to be delivered to the 76th World Health Assembly in 2023, with the aim of adopting the instrument by 2024. </p>  <p>  As provided for in the Constitution, the conclusion of an international agreement is an exercise of the executive power of the State in connection with its external relations and is therefore concluded by or on the authority of the Government. In practice this means that Government approval must be sought for the signature, ratification or approval of every international agreement.</p>  <p>  As the proposed instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response is currently in the very early stages of negotiation, it is not possible at this time to determine the precise legal ramifications of the instrument, nor has it been determined what form the instrument shall take.</p>  <p>  The requirements of the Irish Constitution will, of course, be respected in Ireland&rsquo;s position towards the negotiations and my Department will engage with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to any concerns that may arise in this regard.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term residential care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>All participants within the NHSS contribute up to 80% of their income (40% if part of a couple) and 7.5% per annum of the value of their assets (3.25% if part of a couple). The first &euro;36,000 (&euro;72,000 if part of a couple) is excluded from assessment. </p><p>Assets assessed include cash assets as well as non-cash  assets such as the principal private residence, other property and land, including farmland. </p><p>For the purposes of financial assessment, income includes:</p><p>- Earnings, including income from farming or business activities</p><p>- Pension income</p><p>- Social welfare benefits/allowances</p><p>- Rental income</p><p>- Income from holding an office or directorship</p><p>- Income from fees, commissions, dividends or interest</p><p>- Any income which you have deprived yourself of in the five years prior to application.</p><p>Transferred assets and income, defined as assets or income transferred to another person up to five years  before a person's application to the scheme, are also assessed.</p><p>The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three-year cap, which is intended to protect the value of a principal private residence.</p><p>Last year, the Department of Health introduced the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021, which became operational in October. This introduced a three-year cap on contributions from family farm and business assets, provided that a family successor is appointed to run the asset for at least 6 years. The Act also extended the three-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a principal residence. It is worth noting that under the 2021 Act, any income earned by the family successor in the running of the asset is not considered a 'transferred asset' and is therefore not assessable.</p></reply>

Eligibility guidelines for this payment, as applies in HSE and Section 38 organisations, were published by the HSE on 19th April and are available at www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p><p>Separately, the Department of Health shall shortly publish information for those other certain healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>- Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>- Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>- Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>- Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>- Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in the HSE;</p><p>- Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage</p><p>I am also mindful of other workers who played their own part during this difficult period in sustaining other services. It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline healthcare workers faced. </p><p>In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day. </p><p>Outside of the above recognition measures, the Government also notes that some private sector healthcare employers have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic. The Government would encourage such employers that have not already done so to consider appropriate measures to recognise their own frontline workers for their work during this most trying period.</p></reply>

Eligibility guidelines for this payment, as applies in HSE and Section 38 organisations, were published by the HSE on 19th April and are available at www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html </p><p>Separately, the Department of Health shall shortly publish information for those other certain healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff.

It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above frontline healthcare workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day. </p><p>Outside of the above recognition measures, the Government also notes that some private sector healthcare employers have recognised the work of their employees during the pandemic. The Government would encourage private sector healthcare employers that have not already done so to consider appropriate measures to recognise their own frontline workers for their work during this most trying period.</p></reply>

These changes were to be introduced in phases, with the first phase involving the reduction in the deferral period for Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) scheduled for March of 2022, and the second phase, introducing a system of individual assessment, to occur later in 2022. There has been no delay in the implementation of this change in policy, as the first phase was introduced on March 28th 2022, and the second phase is expected to follow later in 2022.</p>  <p>  The IBTS have advised that "The next phase is very complex and will take time. It requires significant modification to our existing blood systems, work which will take place this year and will see individualised donor risk assessment implemented in full. During the implementation period, blood donors, patient organisations and HIV Ireland will be included in the process. We believe this is a safe approach which will ensure the system is fully validated when we introduce it. There will also be a substantial element of staff training and donor education, elements which are essential as we are transforming the current process."</p></reply>

Using qualitative and quantitative research methods and fieldwork in Ireland and Australia, it endeavours to generate information on doctor retention policy and practice in the Irish health system. </p>  <p>  Issues highlighted in the HDRM Project papers as factors influencing doctors to emigrate, include a lack of access to training and career progression in the Irish health system, demanding expectations in respect of rosters/working hours/location of employment, leading to a poor work-life balance resulting in a deterioration in wellbeing.</p>  <p>  My department has worked closely with the HSE on workforce policy, to produce a suite of initiatives aimed at increasing opportunities for training and career progression in the Irish Health system and to alleviate concerns in respect of issues raised by trainee doctors. </p>  <p>  The HSE NDTP Office is in the initial stages of work regarding doctors who completed an internship in Ireland. Early and provisional data shows that a high percentage of medical interns who graduate leave Ireland for at least one year. However, the data shows that 82% of interns who commenced one year intern training in July 2015 subsequently commenced a Basic Specialist Training (BST) or General Practice (GP) training programme in subsequent years (2016-2021). A small number of the 2015 cohort also remain in the Irish health system either in service grade posts or employed within the private healthcare sector.</p>  <p>  The recruitment and retention of healthcare workers including doctors is a key priority for me and the Government. Retention efforts by the HSE both nationally and locally are in place with significant career development and progression and educational/development opportunities being offered. The Department is also an active partner in the development of the Forum of Irish Postgraduate Medical Training Bodies&rsquo; Strategic Framework 2021-2030, which addresses a number of concerns raised by trainee doctors and cited as reasons for emigration.</p>  <p>  I am due to meet Dr Humphries in May to discuss the work of this group and how it may inform workforce planning policy going forward. </p></reply>

A Risk Equalisation Scheme operates in the health insurance market as a support to our system of community-rated health insurance. Our risk equalisation scheme is a carefully crafted scheme with permission required from the European Commission for its operation. </p>  <p>  Any individual who takes out health insurance as a new entrant, whether resident here or returning from abroad, may have to serve waiting periods before they are fully covered, but accident and injury will be covered immediately. The maximum waiting period for illnesses that start after you join is 26 weeks; and for pre-existing illnesses which existed in the 6 months before you join is 5 years. Once these waiting periods are served, an individual will not have to serve them again if they choose to switch to another insurer, as long as there hasn&rsquo;t been a break in cover of more than 13 weeks. </p>  <p>  The application of waiting periods help support community rating and is an important tool for insurers to combat practices where someone could potentially take out a health insurance policy to avail of a particular treatment and then cancel the policy once treatment had been received, without either penalty or sustained contribution to the community-rated system.</p>  <p>  Private health insurance companies are restricted by legislation from imposing more than 5 years as a waiting period for pre-existing conditions. The law imposes a maximum waiting period but not a minimum period. Insurers can therefore shorten this waiting period, or waive it entirely, as a matter of competitive practice. However, this is a commercial decision, and I cannot compel any private health insurer to provide any product or service, beyond what is included in the minimum benefit regulations.</p>  <p>  Given that the European Commission only recently approved the new Risk Equalisation Scheme for the Irish market for the forthcoming 5 years, there are no immediate plans to alter the basis of our health insurance market.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that pupils participating in the school milk scheme who attend DEIS classified schools are exempt from a parental contribution for the school milk scheme and receive school milk free of charge. A parental contribution is in place for those pupils attending non Deis classified schools.  </p>  <p>  Ireland receives a fixed annual funding allocation  for the School Milk Scheme from the EU Commission of &euro;900,000. My Department contributes supporting Exchequer funding, in the region of &euro;200,000 for the necessary accompanying measures. </p>  <p>  The parental contribution is offset against and bridges the cost of the milk charged by the national suppliers and the financial allocation made available to Ireland from the EU. It is deemed necessary in order to support the wider availability of the EU school milk scheme to those pupils from non Deis schools who choose to enroll, so enabling greater participation in the scheme. </p>  <p>  The parental contribution for the school year 2020 / 2021 amounted to &euro;87,000.  The parental contribution, per child per week, does not exceed &euro;1.20.  The aim is to keep this rate as low as possible. </p>  <p>  The parental contribution is not income received by the State, but is paid by the schools concerned directly to their supplier. A previous evaluation of the School Milk Scheme has shown that the parental contribution is not a significant detriment to the voluntary enrollment by a parent, of their child, in the daily distribution scheme in order to inform healthy eating habits of children at an early age. </p></reply>

Following the COVID-19 crisis and under the auspices of the Farm to Fork Strategy, the Contingency Plan was developed to ensure that EU citizens do not face food shortages during crises. Expert meetings in respect of the Contingency Plan were convened by the EU Commission between January and July 2021. Officials from my Department contributed to these meetings and prepared submissions to inform development of the Plan.  The Contingency Plan for Food Supply and Food Security formally adopted by EU Commission in November 2021 and the EFSCM was published on the Register of Expert Groups on 10 December 2021.</p>  <p>  A full list of participating Member States, Third Countries, organisations and institutions comprising the EFSCM, and details of meetings, is available at the Register of Commission expert groups and other similar entities (europa.eu).</p></reply>

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended). Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel and Marked Gas Oil (MGO) that are used as motor or heating fuels. Gas oil that qualifies for a reduced rate of MOT is marked green and is usually referred to as MGO, green diesel or agricultural diesel. </p>  <p>  MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. The current rate of MOT on MGO is &euro;120.55 per 1000 Litres.  This compares very favourably to the current rate applied to auto diesel which is &euro;405.38 per 1000 Litres.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance reduced the rate on MGO by 2 cents per litre inclusive of VAT from 10 March.  This reduction brought the rate from &euro;138.17 per 1000 Litres to the current rate of &euro;120.55 per 1000 Litres.   Effective from 1 May 2022 a further VAT inclusive 3 cent reduction for MGO will apply, bringing the overall rate of MOT to &euro;111.14 per 1000 Litres.   This reduced rate fully offsets the 1 May 2022 increase in the carbon tax and will apply until 11 October 2022.  </p>  <p>  A Financial Resolution will be brought to the D&aacute;il after the Easter recess to give effect to these changes and provide the legislative basis by way of an amendment to the Finance (Covid Miscellaneous) Bill 2022 currently before the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  Those who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of farming or the trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for these expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.</p>  <p>  I would also note that Section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides further relief on expenditure incurred by farmers in respect of an increase in the carbon tax on farm diesel. It is an additional tax measure for farmers introduced in Budget 2012 which compensates increases in the carbon tax from the 2012 base rate of &euro;15 per tonne of CO2 emission. This measure means that a farmer may take an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel (including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel) and then a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline). </p>  <p>  My colleagues across Government and I continue monitor the situation closely. </p></reply>

Amendments to this policy in 2010 and 2017 were introduced following a full review and public consultation.</p>  <p>  For 2022, Ireland&rsquo;s national Mackerel Quota has been set at 54,992 tonnes.</p>  <p>  Mackerel management policy sets down:</p>  <p>  Where Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota in the annual TAC and Quota Regulation is 90,000 tonnes or below, mackerel is shared out on an 87% -13% basis between the RSW Pelagic segment and the Polyvalent segment.  The share out is applied after the deduction for contingency, swaps, carry over/deductions (as provided for by EU Regulation) and the allocation set aside for hook and line fishery for vessels under 15 metres. </p>  <p>  Where Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota in the annual TAC and Quota Regulation is above 90,000 tonnes, the share out is adjusted so that the element in excess of 90,000 tonnes is shared 80% - 20% between the RSW pelagic segment and the Polyvalent segment. The balance below 90,000 tonnes will be shared out on an 87% -13% basis between the RSW Pelagic segment and the Polyvalent segment.  The share out is applied after the deduction for contingency, swaps, carry over/deductions (as provided for by EU Regulation) and the allocation set aside for hook and line fishery for vessels under 15 metres. </p>  <p>  A minimum of 2% of the mackerel quota (1,100 tonnes in 2022) in the TAC and Quota Regulation or 1,000 tonnes, whichever is greater, is deducted annually for demersal swaps before any share out between segments is undertaken.</p>  <p>  The RSW pelagic segment comprises of 23 vessels. In accordance with mackerel policy, 87% of the national annual quota (45,010 tonnes in 2022) is available for this segment.  There are three ratios within this segment: 8 vessels with ratio 10, 9 vessels with ratio 7, and 6 vessels with ratio 5.</p>  <p>  There are 4 categories of polyvalent vessels permitted to land mackerel. In accordance with policy, 13% of the national annual quota (6,739 tonnes in 2022) is available for this segment. Mackerel Policy provides that 76.50% of the 13% (5,155 tonnes in 2022) is made available to 15 Tier 1 vessels, and 21% of the 13% (1,415 tonnes in 2022) is made available to 12 Tier 2 vessels.  Access to Tier 1 and Tier 2 catch limits was determined using track record set down in 2010. Tier 1 and Tier 2 vessels receive a catch limit for the period 01 January to 30 November each year.</p>  <p>  The remaining 2.50% of the 13% quota available for polyvalent vessels (168 tonnes in 2022) is made available to under 18 metre vessels (including under 15 metre vessels) fishing for mackerel by means other than hook and line.  Catch limits are set by monthly Fisheries Management Notice. The catch limit for the month of April is 3 tonnes. This catch limit is open to all polyvalent vessel under 18 metres in length overall fishing for mackerel by means other than hook and line. </p>  <p>  An allocation of 400 tonnes for a fishery for smaller vessels (under 15 metre vessels) fishing for Mackerel by means of hooks and line is set down in Policy in 2010.  The then Minister amended the Mackerel policy in July 2017 after intensive review and public consultation, however this amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery (the available quota of 400 tonnes had not been caught for all years up to and including 2019). The 400 tonnes is taken off the top of the annual national quota before the polyvalent segment/RSW Pelagic segment split, and does not come out of the 13% polyvalent quota. </p>  <p>  The management arrangements, within the policy, for the Mackerel hook and line fishery has been on the agenda and discussed with Industry representatives at recent meetings of the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC). It is important to note that the remit of the QMAC is to examine and make recommendations within Ministerial Policy. I have asked the QMAC to examine measures to strengthen the management arrangements for the 2022 Mackerel hook and line fishery, within the policy, for my consideration.</p></reply>

Technical measures are rules on how, where and when fishers may fish and also include gear, catch composition and ways to deal with accidental catches.  Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2019/1241 sets out the technical measures for the North Western Waters area, which includes the waters around Ireland.</p>  <p>  Regulation (EU) 2019/1241 simplified the rule structure for technical measures as it replaced a range of different regulations that had previously been in place.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Technical Measures Regulation facilitates a regionalised approach.  The regulation sets out the minimum standards for a sea basin, such as the North Western Waters region, and Member States in that area, in consultation with stakeholders, may propose additional measures through a Joint Recommendation.  My Department and experts from BIM and the Marine Institute actively engage with the relevant other Member States in this forum  to seek agreement on enhanced technical measures, when such measures are demonstrated to improve selectivity and/or protect juvenile or depleted stocks.  The Technical Measures Regulation is therefore one of the key elements contributing to the conservation and sustainability of fish stocks and ensuring the long-term sustainability of fishing in the waters around Ireland and throughout EU waters.</p></reply>

A number of changes to fishing gear and practices which demonstrate improved selectivity have been adopted at EU level following recommendations from the North West Waters Member States Group (Ireland is a key member of the Group).</p>  <p>  From time to time, the quota system is used to incentivise the introduction of environmentally friendly fishing gear in particular fisheries or for particular types of vessels usually in advance of seeking to implement change at EU level.

The arrangements have been set and developed over many years since the commencement of the Common Fisheries Policy and the introduction of quotas. Amendments to the mackerel policy in 2010 and 2017 were introduced following a full review and public consultation.</p>  <p>  Atlantic Mackerel is a widely  distributed, migratory pelagic fish that inhabits much of the north-eastern Atlantic shelf.  The setting of Total Allowable Catches and quotas each year for this stocks is based on  annual scientific advice by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) and given the international dimension of this stock, TACs are set within the relevant international fora.</p>  <p>  Consultation on the management of quota within National  Policy is carried out each month at the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) meeting involving fishing industry representatives from the catching and processing sectors, the Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  The purpose of these meetings is to make recommendations to me on the management of particular stocks within national policy and, as far as possible, I follow their recommendations, subject to the proper management and rational exploitation of our fisheries. </p>  <p>  Pelagic issues, including in relation to the management of the Mackerel quota allocation as set down in national policy, where relevant, are discussed at the QMAC and recommendations brought to my attention to inform my decision.</p></reply>

This amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery - for all years up to and including 2019, the 400 tonne quota was not fully utilised by the sector.  In 2019, for example, the uptake figure for the fishery was 298 tonnes.</p>  <p>  In order to amend mackerel policy, I as Minister must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect policy, it would require due process involving an assessment of all issues arising, including full public consultation. </p>  <p>  There has been, for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for access to and a higher share of the mackerel quota. Mackerel is the stock most impacted by Brexit.  The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota by 2026 to the UK.  This will only increase demands for higher shares of Ireland&rsquo;s quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet. It is worth noting that the 400 tonnes for the hook and line fishery has not been reduced.  Unfortunately, the situation is that if there is an increase for any, such as the hook and line fishery, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the EU-UK TCA.</p></reply>

The number of reports of wild bird mortalities have reduced over the last number of weeks which is a good indication of a reduction in infection pressure. However, the virus can persist.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently actively reviewing the risk level and the continued necessity for the additional biosecurity regulations to protect the poultry populations which were put in place last November.  The measures include a ban on the assembly of birds, the requirement to confine of all poultry or captive birds such that wild birds and other animals do not have access to them and the application of stringent bio-security measures for poultry and other captive birds. </p>  <p>  The legal requirement to confine/house poultry and other birds as a precautionary measure against Avian Influenza (bird flu) will be lifted from the 29th of April 2022. The decision to withdraw this requirement is based on a number of parameters which indicate a reducing risk of an avian influenza incursion - including the fact that no case of bird flu has been confirmed here in wild birds for a period of 4 weeks, reduced numbers of migratory waterfowl and increasing environmental temperatures and daylight hours. </p>  <p>  However, I urge all flock owners to remain vigilant as, notwithstanding the reduced risk, there is still the possibility of the virus being present in the environment or being transmitted to their flock by wild birds. As such, the ban on the assembly of live birds for the purposes of show or sale (SI No 592 of 2021) and enhanced biosecurity requirements (SI No. 593 of 2021) remain in place.</p>  <p>  Whilst I cannot provide a specific date that these measures will be removed, I am hopeful that we will be able to do so shortly.</p>  <p>  The control of AI is critical for our poultry industry and stringent bio-security measures have been vital in mitigating the risk of spread of disease and in protecting poultry flocks across the island. These farm level requirements will remain after these regulations are lifted. All keepers of poultry are urged to continue to maintain the highest standards of biosecurity to protect their flocks and to report any suspicion of disease to their local regional veterinary office.</p></reply>

The Commission has indicated that this process should be viewed as an &lsquo;amicable procedure&rsquo;.</p><p>On 8th December 2021, following the scrutiny of the application by the European Commission, the application for a PGI for &ldquo;Irish Grass Fed Beef&rdquo; was published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union for the three month so called &lsquo;opposition procedure&rsquo; which was open both to EU Member States and third countries to make submissions on the application. The opposition concluded on 8<sup>th</sup>March 2022. </p><p>My Department has been advised that a submission has been made by the UK to the EU during the opposition period. </p><p>The next stage is that my Department and Bord Bia will engage in consultations with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to discuss the submission made by the UK and taking into account the PGI regulatory requirements.  The European Commission will be notified of the outcome of those consultations and at that stage we will be advised by the Commission on the next steps. </p><p>I am excited about seeing the Irish Grass Fed Beef  PGI standard come to fruition as I believe it can benefit our farm families across the island.</p></reply>

As well as the immediate humanitarian crisis, which must take priority, we need to take the necessary steps to ensure that food security is maintained. </p>  <p>  At farm level, the crisis is already impacting very significantly on the price of fertiliser, animal feed and fuel. Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team to actively monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.</p>  <p>  I also established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee headed by Teagasc and tasked it to prepare an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.</p>  <p>  There are sufficient supplies of fertiliser and animal feed at present although price remains a concern. The Government have introduced a temporary reduction in excise duty on fuels, assistance on the price of electricity &amp;amp; gas, and a targeted and temporary grant scheme for hauliers, all of which will be of some assistance to farmers and the agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  On 22nd March, the Government approved my proposal for a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative, worth over &euro;12 million to support Irish farmers. This package is aimed at producing more native crops and reducing dependency on imports, and on producing crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser.</p>  <p>  Following recent discussions at EU level, including extensive engagement by EU Agriculture Ministers, the European Commission announced on Wednesday 23rd March, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of actions to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs. This includes an exceptional aid package to support impacted farming sectors, and I announced on 13th April that Ireland's allocation of &euro;15.8 million in exceptional EU funding would be deployed to support the pig and horticulture sectors.</p>  <p>  I continue to engage with all our stakeholders and continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal. I am taking a very proactive approach to the crisis in Ukraine. We must protect our farm families and their businesses through this period of significant upheaval.</p></reply>

One of the interventions proposed in Ireland&rsquo;s draft CSP is an agri-environment climate measure (AECM). &euro;1.5 billion has been allocated to this flagship agri-environment scheme which will be the successor to the Green Low Carbon Agri-environment Scheme (GLAS) which was available under Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that the exciting national agri-environmental climate measure will consist of two approaches, namely: </p>  <p>  - An AECM General, available nationally (outside of the high priority geographical area as defined for the AECM Co-operation Project approach below), which offers a range of measures (both targeted and general); and</p>  <p>  - An AECM Co-operation Project, available to farmers in defined high priority geographical areas. If a farmer in one of these areas volunteers to participate, they may undertake bespoke farm, landscape and catchment measures, as well as being able to undertake actions from the AECM General suite of actions. Farmers participating in this approach can avail of the assistance of a Local Cooperation Project (CP) Team, who will assist with the implementation of the scheme at local level.</p>  <p>  With reference to the specific question, I reassure the Deputy that, as was the case in GLAS, all farmers, who apply for the Basic Payment Scheme, will have access to the new AECM. No area has been excluded.  The purpose of the map, which shows the western most tip of the Dingle Peninsula in white, was to give an indication of the defined high priority geographical areas that would fall within the AECM Co-operation Project approach.</p>  <p>  That map, accessible at www.gov.ie/en/publication/76026-common-agricultural-policy-cap-post-2020/ , is colour-coded to show the eight areas in the country that have been identified as having particular environmental characteristics, where farmers may engage in the new AECM through the cooperation project teams.  Farmers in the rest of the country, shown in white on the map, may apply to participate in the AECM General, where they may choose from a range of environmental actions.</p></reply>

The Green Teams consists of volunteer representatives at all grades who serve as green champions throughout the various locations. The Green Team's goals are to raise awareness and implement practices locally which reduce my Department&rsquo;s energy and environmental footprint and support biodiversity projects.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is actively participating in the Public Sector Energy Reporting Programme reporting all of its energy consumption through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's (SEAI) Monitoring and Reporting online system.  Since 2009, energy efficiency has improved by almost 34.1% in the Department, avoiding consumption of 22.4M kWh of energy.  This has been achieved mainly by low-cost measures such as behavioural changes, better energy management, and lighting retrofits.  In order to achieve continuous energy efficiency, additional works will be required throughout the Department to reach its 2030 and 2050 targets.</p></reply>

For a farmer to be deemed active, they must demonstrate how they bear the economic and agricultural risk with regard to the agricultural activity being undertaken.  There is no minimum number of hectares for an applicant to be deemed active.</p><p>Within the CAP Strategic Plan (CSP), it has been proposed that the Active Farmer check in Ireland will be based, in the first instance on a stocking rate check for grassland farmers.  The stocking rate will be aligned to the Areas of Natural Constraint (ANC) scheme and for 2023, this is proposed to be 0.10 Livestock Units per hectare (LU/Ha).  To facilitate prompt payment, the check  will based on stock held in 2022, with an option for 2023 to be used for new entrants or for those who could not meet the threshold in 2022. </p><p>However, where livestock farmers cannot meet the minimum of 0.10 LU/Ha due to environmental limitations, a lower stocking rate will be acceptable. For those grassland farmers who maintain the land by non-grazing means such as topping or cutting hay or silage, they will have to indicate how the land is maintained and evidence may be requested to support this.</p><p>For farmers involved in tillage and / or permanent crops, my Department will administratively check a sample of herds. This will involve applicants being requested to provide evidence of activity on their part. For tillage farmers this would likely be receipts for seed, fertiliser, pesticides etc. in the applicant&rsquo;s name. A valid share farming agreement is a legitimate means of demonstrating an activity on the part of the applicant.</p><p>The intention of the &quot;active farmer&quot; check is to ensure  that payments are directed to those actively engaged in farming and taking the risk with regard to the farm business.  These proposed checks under the CSP will ensure this, while also not imposing undue administrative overheads on farm businesses.  My Department expects the vast majority of farmers will easily satisfy this check and will be assessed automatically by the online application system in 2023.</p><p>However, it is important to reiterate that where a farmer does not satisfy the active farmer check, they will not be in a position to draw down <b>any</b>Direct Payments. In that context, In the coming months, my Department will write to those farmers that would not be categorised as active based on the information currently held by my Department. This will allow those farmers sufficient time to make the necessary changes in advance of 2023 if they so wish.</p></reply>

These measures include microchipping animals, providing tapeworm treatment and rabies vaccination for pets, as required. Pet owners are provided with information translated into Ukrainian, on how to manage their pet in home isolation, where relevant. Department staff follow up with the pet owners to advise them on the necessary requirements to bring these pets into compliance with EU Pet Travel regulations. My Department staff have arrangements in place with private veterinarians to provide the treatments to bring Ukrainian pets into compliance at no cost to their owners.  This exceptional response is being kept under review.</p>  <p>  All other movements of animals (unaccompanied, commercial, unknown origin, stray animals, animals from shelters) that do not meet regular requirements for entry, cannot be accepted into Ireland without full compliance with legislatively prescribed health certification.</p></reply>

Accordingly, in applying for BEAM, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% in either the original reduction period (1 July 2020 &ndash; 30 June 2021) or the deferred reduction period (1 January 2021 &ndash; 31 December 2021) when compared with the reference period of 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019.</p>  <p>  Approximately 22,000 participants did meet all the commitments set out in section 7.0 of the BEAM Terms and Conditions and thus successfully exited the scheme. A further approximately 11,000 participants did not meet some or all of the commitments set out in section 7.0 of the BEAM Terms and Conditions. As a result, recoupment of almost &euro;18 million in overpayments has commenced. </p>  <p>  As an Accredited EU Paying Agency, my Department  must recover debts in respect of overpayments and penalties across a broad range of agricultural schemes, including the BEAM scheme. Debt recovery may be facilitated by means direct repayment by the debtor or through deductions from other payments due. If a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties, payment by instalments over a period of time can be accommodated on a case-by-case basis.  In such situations the debtor may contact the Accounts Division of my Department to discuss their circumstances and to arrange an appropriate payment plan. The availability of this facility was advised to BEAM debtors when they were notified with details of their BEAM overpayment. My Department Accounts Division can be contacted by telephone on (049) 4368207 or by email at debtrecovery@agriculture.gov.ie</p></reply>

Accordingly, in applying for BEAM, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% in either the original reduction period (1 July 2020 &ndash; 30 June 2021) or the deferred reduction period (1 January 2021 &ndash; 31 December 2021) when compared with the reference period of 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019.</p>  <p>  Approximately 22,000 participants did meet all the commitments set out in section 7.0 of the BEAM Terms and Conditions and thus successfully exited the scheme. A further approximately 11,000 participants did not meet some or all of the commitments set out in section 7.0 of the BEAM Terms and Conditions. As a result, recoupment of almost &euro;18 million in over-payments has commenced. </p>  <p>  As an Accredited EU Paying Agency, my Department  must recover debts in respect of over-payments and penalties across a broad range of agricultural schemes, including the BEAM scheme. Debt recovery may be facilitated by means of direct repayment by the farmer or through deductions from other payments due. If a farmer is experiencing financial difficulties, payment by instalments over a period of time can be accommodated on a case-by-case basis.  In such situations the farmer may contact the Accounts Division of my Department to discuss their circumstances and to arrange an appropriate payment plan. The availability of this facility was advised to affected BEAM participants when they were notified with details of their BEAM over-payment. The Department's Accounts Division can be contacted by telephone on (049) 4368207 or by email at debtrecovery@agriculture.gov.ie</p></reply>

The Department continuously monitors the market situation for beef and other agri-food commodities, with a view to responding to crisis situations where possible.</p>  <p>  I raised concerns in relation to the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on agri-food supply chains at the extraordinary informal meeting of European Union Agriculture Ministers held on 2nd March and at the AgriFish Council on 21st March. At these meetings I underlined the need to closely monitor supply chains to ensure an effective and functioning Single Market, and to be ready to consider any measures that may help to alleviate the difficulties caused. </p>  <p>  The Commission has already announced a number of support measures, including the introduction of private storage aid for the pigmeat sector, a new exceptional aid support package making available a fund of &euro;500 million for affected sectors, increased payment advances in 2022 and a new temporary State Aid framework.</p>  <p>  More specifically for the beef sector, the Department provides a range of financial aids to support beef farm incomes and to support economic and environmental efficiency. The core support for the beef sector under the outgoing RDP is the &euro;300 Million Beef Data and Genomics Programme. In addition to this support, since 2020, over &euro;260 million of extra supports were made available specifically to the beef sector. These supports are additional to the more general supports that beef farmers can avail of under the current RDP including ANCs.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the proposal for the beef sector in Ireland's new CAP strategic plan is to continue to provide support to farmers by building on the efficiency gains of the BDGP and the BEEP-S measures through the Suckler Carbon Efficiency Programme. I remain committed to supporting the economic and environmental sustainability of the suckler and beef sector.</p></reply>

However, in conjunction with good grassland management, sensible use of fertiliser represents the best way of securing fodder for next winter. In addition, the price of grain has risen in line with fertiliser prices, so relying entirely on imported concentrates is not a reliable alternative to securing home grown fodder. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I announced a Targeted Intervention Package on 22nd March 2022 framed around three pillars to support Irish farming families arising both from events in Ukraine and wider global price volatility. The total package is projected to cost in the region of &euro;12.2 million.  The package seeks to incentivise the planting of additional tillage crops through the Tillage Incentive Scheme and introduces supports to encourage farmers to grow more protein crops in 2022. Supporting domestic production of tillage and protein crops will reduce Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on imported feed materials. </p>  <p>  The package also includes a Multi-Species Sward Initiative and a Red Clover Silage Measure, to promote environmentally sustainable methods of farming, and thereby reduce nitrogen fertiliser usage, while maintaining forage yields.  </p>  <p>  The financial supports outlined will assist farmers in offsetting the significant increases in farm inputs experienced by farmers presently and in assisting to ensure sufficient fodder for winter 2022. I assure the Deputy that I am committed to helping and assisting our farmers through this challenging period and both I, my Department and the National Fodder and Food Security Committee are continuing to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

Coillte felling licences will maintain the levels they achieved in 2021.</p><p>- The Department will also refocus on the delivery of approvals from several schemes including Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) (Ash Dieback), the Reconstitution of Woodland Scheme (Frost) and  the Native Woodland Scheme.</p><p>- As can be seen in the table below, as of 1st April 2022 the projected target of year to date licences to be issued was 1,313 and the output of licences was 1,310.</p><p>As can be seen in the table below, as of 15th April 2022 the projected target of year to date licences to be issued was 1,515 and the output of licences was 1,480. <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme </th>       <th>Output YTD Licences </th>       <th>Target YTD Licences </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Felling (Private)</td>       <td>419 </td>       <td>525 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Felling (Coillte)</td>       <td>654 </td>       <td>450 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Afforestation </td>       <td>178 </td>       <td>300 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roads </td>       <td>229 </td>       <td>240 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total (licences) </td>       <td>1,480 </td>       <td>1,515 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I remain fully committed to delivering a licensing system which will meets the needs of the sector and of society and recent licensing trends demonstrate that we are making progress towards achieving this.

The sector has experienced a contraction in growers in recent months and it is considered that the current situation poses an existential challenge to the sector. A wide section of commercial growers within the horticulture industry are impacted, the most affected being the energy intensive crop growers including tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers.</p>  <p>  A package of &euro;2.8 million has been allocated to this support scheme for horticulture growers from the EU Exceptional Aid Package. The support scheme will be provided in the form of a once-off payment to growers in those sub-sectors most affected and which have been identified as being at most risk including the glasshouse high-wire crops, field vegetable, mushroom and apple sectors. The support scheme will mitigate against the increase in input costs across these sub-sectors which is threatening the viability and sustainability of these sectors and impacting on food security. </p>  <p>  In preparing this support package, my focus was on sub-sectors within the edible horticulture industry that were most impacted by the current Ukrainian crisis. While acknowledging that soft fruit growers are also incurring increased input costs, growers in this sector were not identified as being impacted by the current crisis in the same way as the glasshouse high-wire crops, field vegetable, mushroom and apple sectors.</p></reply>

The new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) cites generational renewal as one of its nine key objectives, while it is also prominent in Food Vision 2030, the new stakeholder-led strategy for the agri-food sector. </p>  <p>  There are a range of measures in place at present, both in the existing CAP and at national level, to facilitate generational renewal. For older farmers specifically, under the current CAP, support is available to establish Collaborative Farming arrangements. The new draft CAP Strategic Plan proposes a new initiative to support advice for older farmers on succession and retirement options.</p>  <p>  Further assistance is available from national supports including through taxation measures such as the Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax, Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax and Long-Term Leasing Relief, as well as the availability of tax credits via the Succession Farm Partnerships. Such interventions provide vital supports for older farmers wishing to retire.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I recently established the Food Vision Dairy Group, which brings together key stakeholders to advance the actions for the dairy sector identified in the strategy, with the action &ldquo;produce a detailed plan by Q2 2022 to manage the sustainable environmental footprint of the dairy sector&rdquo; as a priority. The Group has been characterised by constructive engagement to date, with discussions on a variety of issues on the challenges facing the dairy sector, and I look forward to seeing the results of its deliberations shortly in the form of an interim report. No decisions on specific actions have been taken as yet.</p>  <p>  I want to ensure that the dairy and wider agri-food sector remain strong and sustainable into the future, and will continue to engage with stakeholders to find the best approaches to support all farmers to ensure a bright future for the sector.</p></reply>

The Forum brings together all public, community and voluntary organisations active locally, as well as the Cathaoirleach or Mayor of each local authority. Members of the local Ukrainian community will be fully involved. The role of each Forum is to coordinate the community-led response in the provision of assistance and support to Ukrainian refugees as they are accommodated around the country.</p>  <p>  My Department has worked with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the CCMA to agree a Community Response Framework which will guide that work.  The Framework sets out a national template for arrangements to be put in place in each area to enable all involved at a local level - including the community and voluntary sector - to work together to support the integration of displaced Ukrainians in our communities, under the stewardship of the local authorities. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s key focus in relation to the current situation is to ensure that the resources, skills and capacity of the local development, community development and charity sector are utilised to maximum effect to help address the challenges arising. My Department is linking with key stakeholders at community level, providing information, and assisting the co-ordination of supports through the community sector. </p>  <p>  My Department has also committed to enabling flexibility in programme delivery to shift focus onto the Ukraine response, where necessary. For example, flexibility has been offered to Local Development Companies in respect of SICAP resources.  This will ensure that around 600 Community Development Workers are available to help support arrivals from Ukraine. In addition, organisations supported under the Community Services Programme can include Ukrainians in the target groups for their services. Exceptional additional funding for staff resources is being provided by my Department to Volunteer Centres providing support in frontline reception hubs, and to a CSP organisation to assist their efforts in co-ordinating the response to Ukrainian refugees.</p>  <p>  Our volunteer support programme, which includes Volunteer Ireland and the network of volunteer centres, is heavily engaged in sourcing volunteers to address the many requests for specific volunteer roles emerging across the country.  These include reception centres, provision of basic supplies, integration services, access to information, etc. The Community Volunteers pilot programme is also providing a way for local communities to offer support to those in need. Developed based on lessons learned about volunteering during COVID-19, the programme is funded by my Department, coordinated by Volunteer Ireland and Volunteer Centres, and supported by the Local Authority in each area. </p>  <p>  I recognise that the capacity, willingness and expertise exists at local level to co-ordinate responses, signpost services, and link voluntary and statutory efforts. Huge efforts were made by volunteers during the pandemic, and dedicated volunteers across the country are working again to help people from Ukraine arriving in Ireland. Government is working to ensure that local capacity, resources and knowledge are brought to bear on the overall humanitarian response and will work closely with Local Authorities to ensure a well-co-ordinated and seamless approach.</p></reply>

The expenditure figures relate to funding drawn down to date in each LAG area relevant to the Transitional LEADER programme in the period 1<sup>st</sup>April 2021 to 1<sup>st</sup>April 2022.  This includes payments in respect of completed project activity and the administration cost of the LAGs associated with the delivery of the Transitional LEADER programme.  </p><p>Once a project is approved for funding the promoter is afforded time to complete the approved works and submit claims for payment of grant funding. In this regard it should be noted that throughout period in question, the LAGs have also draw down funding in respect of completed works for projects approved under the 2014-2020 LEADER programme. </p><p>The project funding available under the Transitional LEADER Programme continues to be allocated by the LAGs on an ongoing basis.  Figures related to such allocations are not included in the expenditure column below as they have not yet resulted in a drawdown in funding.  I am confident that the level of funding available will be sufficient to meet the demand from rural communities and businesses and to continue the effective operation of the Transitional LEADER Programme through to the end of 2022. </p><p><b>Table 1: Funding Allocations and Expenditure for the Transitional LEADER Programme</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Action Group</th>       <th>Transitional LEADER Programme Allocation</th>       <th>Transitional LEADER Programme Expenditure <br /><br />1st April 2021 &ndash; 1st   April 2022</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td>&euro;1,895,874</td>       <td>&euro;221,422</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td>&euro;2,517,948</td>       <td>&euro;362,804</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>&euro;2,635,521</td>       <td>&euro;423,491</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork North </td>       <td>&euro;1,504,409</td>       <td>&euro;471,579</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork South </td>       <td>&euro;1,131,976</td>       <td>&euro;314,746</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork West </td>       <td>&euro;1,481,904</td>       <td>&euro;260,959</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>&euro;3,815,464</td>       <td>&euro;774,186</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin Rural </td>       <td>&euro;1,882,175</td>       <td>&euro;339,364</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway East </td>       <td>&euro;2,261,956</td>       <td>&euro;588,652</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway West </td>       <td>&euro;1,341,373</td>       <td>&euro;273,393</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>&euro;3,019,507</td>       <td>&euro;1,041,450</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td>&euro;1,554,564</td>       <td>&euro;441,742</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>&euro;2,302,056</td>       <td>&euro;445,278</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>&euro;2,104,992</td>       <td>&euro;443,066</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>&euro;1,772,277</td>       <td>&euro;348,848</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>&euro;2,740,812</td>       <td>&euro;886,022</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td>&euro;2,244,752</td>       <td>&euro;626,875</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>&euro;1,802,823</td>       <td>&euro;287,896</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>&euro;3,285,878</td>       <td>&euro;464,314</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>&euro;2,039,559</td>       <td>&euro;385,722</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td>&euro;2,243,303</td>       <td>&euro;448,694</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>&euro;2,374,498</td>       <td>&euro;456,158</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>&euro;2,615,558</td>       <td>&euro;271,429</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>&euro;2,261,896</td>       <td>&euro;351,868</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>&euro;2,985,108</td>       <td>&euro;676,622</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>&euro;2,222,644</td>       <td>&euro;358,277</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>&euro;2,181,697</td>       <td>&euro;378,126</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>&euro;2,907,314</td>       <td>&euro;602,099</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>&euro;1,872,162</td>       <td>&euro;301,674</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>&euro;65,000,000</td>       <td>&euro;13,246,757</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The 2022 CL&Aacute;R programme was launched on 24th February  with an increased budget of &euro;7 million. The measures being funded this year are </p>  <p>  - Measure 1: Developing Community Facilities &amp;amp; Amenities; </p>  <p>  - Measure 2: Mobility, Cancer Care and Community First Responders Transport and </p>  <p>  - Measure 3: Our Islands.</p>  <p>  A group that received CL&Aacute;R funding in the past is not prohibited from reapplying under a subsequent round of CL&Aacute;R funding, although previous funding may be a consideration when selecting the successful project applications.  </p>  <p>  Under the 'Developing Community Facilities and Amenities' measure (measure 1), applications must be made through local authorities in the first instance. The relevant local authority must ensure that successful applicants make facilities accessible to the public and have clear arrangements in place to ensure the facility is adequately insured and managed properly. Furthermore, facilities on school grounds must be open to the public outside school hours. </p>  <p>  I understand from the Department of Education and Skills that schools are required to have public liability and employer liability insurance in place in respect of their school, including outdoor areas of the school. The terms of such policies would be a matter between the school and its insurer. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education's  Guidelines on the Use of School Buildings Outside of School Hours provide information which schools should take into consideration where a third party is seeking to use school property or facilities. In such circumstances it is a matter for the owner of the school to decide whether a proposed use can be considered. Where a school does decide to make its property or facilities available, it should ensure that a legal agreement is put in place and that the third party user has  appropriate insurance cover in place.</p></reply>

Under last year's schemes, projects that bring vacant properties in town centres back into use as remote working hubs were eligible for funding. The repurposing of existing community or publicly owned buildings in town or village centres to facilitate remote working were also eligible application themes.  Similarly, funding for such projects is also available under the LEADER programme, where projects are approved via the Local Action Groups in each area in line with locally identified needs.</p>  <p>  In December 2021, a call for applications under the RRDF was announced. The closing date for submissions is the 29th of April 2022.  The lead party in an application must be a State funded body however a community organisation may partner in an application. A RRDF application pack is available on my Departments website.</p>  <p>  In February of this year I announced almost &euro;18.5m for projects under the 2021 Town and Village Renewal Scheme.  This included support for 28 projects related to remote working and hubs.  Details of the 2022 Town and Village Renewal scheme will be announced shortly.  As in previous years, local authorities will be notified when the 2022 scheme is launched. They will then seek expressions of interest from rural communities for projects that meet the 2022 scheme criteria. Suitable projects will be developed into funding applications and then submitted to the Department for consideration.</p>  <p>  In addition to these funding streams, I have also made available significant funding for hubs to develop their capacity and facilities. Last May, I launched the National Connected Hubs network together with the connectedhubs.ie platform.  The platform offers a suite of booking and hub management applications to members of the Network. There are currently 229 hubs live on the platform, with this number increasing on an ongoing basis.  Details for the onboarded hub facilities can be obtained via the Connected hubs platform - www.connectedhubs.ie. </p>  <p>  Last July, I also allocated almost &euro;9 million through the 2021 Connected Hubs Fund, which supported over 100 hubs and BCPs, enabling applicants to develop and leverage the capacity and quality of existing remote working facilities across the country. In February this year, I launched the 2022 Connected Hubs Call, allocating a further &euro;5 million in funding to add additional capacity to the existing remote working infrastructure in remote working hubs and Broadband Connection Points throughout the country. The closing date for this round of funding was 4 April. My officials are currently evaluating the applications submitted and I expect to announce the successful applicants in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  To support the ongoing strategic development of the National Hub Network, the dataset drawn from the National Hubs Network will contribute to decisions pertaining to the location of remote working hubs that will be funded by my Department under future iterations of the various available funding schemes.</p>  <p>  The development of a National Hubs Network is a key commitment in Our Rural Future and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the ongoing strategic development of a comprehensive and integrated network of remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role that they can play in our post-Covid recovery.</p></reply>

The initiative funds the deployment of free to use WiFi in public spaces, such as town squares, public parks, libraries and other areas where the public congregate. The WiFi service is reliable and secure and does not harvest data for commercial purposes. </p>  <p>  Under the WiFi4EU scheme, local authorities applied through a competitive process to secure vouchers worth &euro;15,000 each to install WiFi hotspots.  Local authorities could apply for up to 4 vouchers each throughout the lifetime of the initiative, and they must install a minimum of 10 access points per voucher.  </p>  <p>  Since the scheme was launched in 2018, Irish local authorities have secured 114 vouchers out of a maximum of 124 vouchers available. This makes Ireland one of the most successful countries to take part in the scheme. 30 of the 31 local authorities in the state, including Cork County Council, secured vouchers under the scheme.  The last call for applications was in June 2020, and the application process is thus closed.</p>  <p>  My Department is providing co-funding of up to &euro;15,000 for each voucher secured by local authorities, effectively doubling the value of the investment. This funding is based on the completion of the project and validation of the network by the European Commission.</p>  <p>  Cork County Council was successful in securing 4 vouchers in December 2019, with a date of 12 August 2022 for submission of all relevant documents to the EU for validation and closure of the project. Once validation of the network is completed by the European Commission, Cork County Council will be in a position to apply for co funding from my department for any qualifying additional work undertaken. No such submission has yet been received.</p>  <p>  In general terms, officials at my Department do not see the WiFi4EU deployment plans of a local authority until they have been submitted in support of an application for co-funding. As such, I would advise the Deputy to seek such plans from Cork County Council directly.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises the opportunity that this funding scheme represents for communities across the state, not least rural and under-served communities. As such, I would strongly recommend that all local authorities that have yet to do so, complete their WiFi4EU works well ahead of the deadline. This will allow time for the Commission to validate the work and for co-funding to be drawn down from my Department.</p></reply>

In addition, in the event that a LAG fully utilises their allocation of administration funding, they can avail of a maximum monthly contribution that will be Exchequer funded and will be available to them to the end of 2022. </p>  <p>  A further &euro;3 million of the funding has been allocated to support co-operation projects and innovation between LAGs, while the remaining &euro;2 million has been allocated to provide preparatory support for the next LEADER programme.</p>  <p>  The project funding available under the Transitional LEADER Programme continues to be allocated by the LAGs on an ongoing basis.  I am confident that the level of funding available will be sufficient to meet the demand from rural communities and businesses and to continue the effective operation of the Transitional LEADER Programme through to the end of 2022.</p></reply>
