    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-24a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032400045#WRA00600"><p>In March 2021, following publication of the Independent Review into Illegal Birth Registration,  I asked Professor Conor O&rsquo;Mahony, the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, to consider the significant complexities and challenges which arise in relation to the issue of illegal birth registrations, and to provide a report proposing an appropriate course of action. On 14th March 2022 I published the report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 16 of the report by the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection was that provision should be made to cover legal costs associated with a declaration of parentage of persons affected by illegal birth registrations. In response, the Government approved a once-off payment of &euro;3,000 for the individuals whose illegal birth registration has been confirmed by Tusla from the files of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild. </p>  <p>  This once-off payment of &euro;3,000 is intended as contribution towards costs such as creating or amending wills or seeking a declaration of parentage. While it could also be used for DNA testing, Tusla has covered the costs of DNA testing for individuals in cases where records were insufficient to confirm an illegal birth registration and will continue to provide this support.</p>  <p>  Tusla already hold confirmation of illegal birth registrations from the files of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild that can form the basis for a payment to the individuals affected without any need to bring forward evidence and meet a certain burden of proof.  There may be potential to extend the payment to other confirmed cases after the Birth Information and Tracing Bill has provided access to records and people with suspicions are, therefore, able to access evidence necessary to confirm illegal birth registration and effect a change in the birth register. </p>  <p>  In terms of the basis for the figure of &euro;3,000, this was informed by the work of the Interdepartmental Group on Illegal Birth Registration and by the Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s recommendation in terms of the purpose of the payment. </p>  <p>  My officials are currently working to establish the scheme with the intention of making payments as soon as possible in 2022.</p></reply>

My Department is currently in the process of commissioning a qualitative research study to examine the workplace experiences of parents coping with pregnancy loss. </p>  <p>  The study will examine whether policy interventions are required at a national level to better support bereaved parents in the workplace following pregnancy loss. Recommendations arising out of this study will help to inform Government policy on this matter, including the development of legislation if required.</p>  <p>  In December 2021, a Request for Quote (RFQ) for the qualitative research study issued to relevant academics with an interest in this area of research. The RFQ did not generate the level of interest expected and no responses were received by the deadline of 31 January 2022. </p>  <p>  A number of interested parties have since indicated difficulties with the timing of the call and the Department is currently revising its approach to the commissioning process. The Department continues to work with a view towards having the research undertaken and completed by the end of 2022.</p></reply>

In the twelve months since its publication my department has placed a significant focus on delivering the new model of accommodation and supports for International Protection applicants and the project is progressing as scheduled. </p>  <p>  A new dedicated team has been established in my department to drive implementation of the new model. This Transition Team is working closely with key Departments and Agencies including the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Housing Agency and Local Authorities to develop the new accommodation model and support services for applicants.</p>  <p>  Governance structures have put in place in the form of a Programme Board which includes representation from the NGO sector and an External Advisory Committee to oversee transition to the new system.  The Board has met regularly over the past twelve months to review progress. As part of the Programme Board governance framework it has appointed a Risk Committee to oversee the management of risks. </p>  <p>  A detailed implementation plan has been developed. This plan sets out the approach that will be taken to ensure that the new system of International Protection is in place by 2024. The Transition Team has also engaged with other key stakeholders who have a responsibility for delivering services to International Protection applicants. Each stakeholder has been asked to provide input to the implementation plan setting out their deliverables and timelines. </p>  <p>  DCEDIY has also engaged directly with the Department Health and the HSE on the resource and service implications of the new model for the health service. I am happy to say a representative from the HSE has recently joined the Programme Board which will support the process of ensuring the health service requirements of new model are addressed. </p>  <p>  As set out in the White Paper the specific needs of applicants with disabilities is a focus of the new model. From the vulnerability assessment process that will be rolled out, specific pathways will be developed including ensuring access to the required medical services. The Transition Team will be engaging closely with the Department of Health and the HSE over the coming weeks and months to progress all aspects of the new model including the specific needs of applicants with disabilities. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made to put in place the new accommodation model.  This has involved working very closely with the Housing Agency in the development of detailed policy advice papers including an acquisition policy, an ownership model and a funding scheme for Approved Housing bodies (AHBS). The funding scheme is scheduled to be launched in early quarter two and will support AHBs to start building a pipeline of Phase Two accommodation. Planning is also well advanced on the acquisition of a range of properties for Phase Two accommodation in the community. </p>  <p>  Work is also moving ahead on developing the system of income support that applicants will receive when moving into Phase Two accommodation. A policy paper has been developed and work is now proceeding to design the operational structures for the payment. </p>  <p>  The Transition Team is also developing an integration programme to support the principle of &lsquo;integration from day one&rsquo; as set out in the White Paper. In collaboration with the Local Authorities there has been a focus on designing the supports that will be required at a local level. The proposal is to expand the current model of interagency working groups and resettlement and intercultural workers that is in place for the Irish Refugee Protection Programme.  </p>  <p>  The aim is to establish a permanent integration system at local level that will provide support both to programme refugees and to applicants for international protection.  A draft of the local Integration Model is currently under discussion with the Local Authorities and work will continue over the coming weeks to finalise it.</p>  <p>  I am also delighted to say that a new webpage has been launched on the gov.ie platform to allow the public to follow implementation of the White Paper. This webpage will be updated regularly with information and reports on the progress of transitioning to the new model of accommodation for International Protection applicants.</p>  <p>  As you will appreciate the focus of the first year has been on developing the policies underpinning the new model, undertaking the planning necessary for implementation and focusing on the acquisition of Phase Two accommodation. </p>  <p>  The remainder of 2022 will be particularly complex as it involves the operationalisation of new systems for income and integration supports. Notwithstanding this, my department is aiming to begin to transition International Protection applicants to Phase Two accommodation in 2022 if the income and integration supports are in place this year. </p>  <p>  The large number of Ukrainian refugees that have arrived and are projected to arrive over the next months may potentially absorb some of the available capacity that was intended for this project.  It may reduce the amount of accommodation, civil service staffing resources and NGO capacity available in the short term. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the Transition Team however will continue to move ahead with implementing the new model and as mentioned aim to have applicants moving into Phase Two accommodation this year. The implementation of the new model will continue to be a key priority for my department.</p></reply>

The Directive, at Article 20 provides a two-year extension, up to 2nd August 2024 for Member States to implement the final two weeks of paid parental leave provided for under Article 5. Ireland fully expects to meet these transposition deadlines.</p><p>While many of the provisions of the Directive are already in place or have been implemented, there remain a small number yet to be translated into Irish law and procedures.</p><p>Legislative proposals to transpose the remaining Articles, which are</p><p>- Article 6 which requires each worker to a right to carers&rsquo; leave of five working days per year; and</p><p>- Article 9 which provides workers who are parents of children up to at least 8 years old, and carers under the Directive, with a right to request flexible working arrangements,</p><p>are currently being prepared and will be brought to Government in the coming month. It is anticipated that these will be in place in advance of the 2nd August 2022 transposition deadline.</p><p>As announced in budget 2022, Parent's Leave and Benefit, which is the paid parental leave required under Article 5 of the Directive, will be increased by a further two weeks to seven weeks, in July 2022. This will be done by way of Regulation as provided for under the Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 (as amended). The final two weeks required under the Directive will be in place in advance of the 2nd August 2024 transposition deadline.</p></reply>

There have been a number of significant achievements under the Strategy to date.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth funds a disability information service for employers - &lsquo;Employers for Change: A Disability Information Service&rsquo;. This provides expert peer advice on employing staff with disabilities and enhancing the confidence and competence of employers to employ, manage and retain staff with disabilities. It forms part of a wider Employer Awareness Campaign that the Department will roll out in 2022. </p>  <p>  Government is committed to leading by example and increasing the number of persons with disabilities employed in the public sector. The statutory target will move from 3% to 6%. This will be enshrined in primary legislation via the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill) which will be introduced to the Houses in a matter of weeks.</p>  <p>  A key success under CES is the decision to allow young people leaving school or rehabilitative training to defer their day service placement by up to 3 years. This allows them to pursue other avenues of life such as further education or employment. Of 206 young people who chose to defer their day service place as part of the pilot to the end of December 2020, only 14 have returned to a day service, with 27 choosing to be removed from the deferral list entirely.</p>  <p>  In line with CES commitments, the Public Appointment Service produced its "Guide to Promoting Inclusive Employment."</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Towards Work&rsquo; Project was recently launched by An Taoiseach, Miche&aacute;l Martin T.D., focusing on providing further practical support to people with disabilities to enter into the workforce. </p>  <p>  The Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant, the Personal Reader Grant, the Job Interview Interpreter Grant; and the Employee Retention Grant exist to support employers in creating disability friendly workplaces.</p>  <p>  We have seen increases in the participation by students with physical or mobility disabilities in higher education, and the increased uptake in mainstream education and training options among young people with disabilities. </p>  <p>The third and final Action Plan for the Strategy is currently being developed and will further drive progress under the Strategy.  </p></reply>

There are 30 CCC located nationwide, which are funded by my Department. CCC play an active and important role in providing support and guidance to local early learning and childcare providers and to families accessing these services. </p>  <p>  CCC are also responsive to new and emerging issues for the early learning and childcare sector.  They played an instrumental role in supporting the sector throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, through for example an out of hours Covid-19 helpline for providers and an early learning and childcare matching service for families. CCC are now taking important steps to respond to the early learning and childcare needs of Ukrainian children and their families.</p>  <p>  In 'First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families', my Department committed to completing a comprehensive review of the operating model for early learning and childcare. The work of CCC was in scope of this review, in addition to the work of other organisations in the operating model.</p>  <p>  The early learning and childcare sector in Ireland has grown substantially in the past decade. The objective of the Review is to ensure that the operating model is fit for purpose to implement policy relating early learning and childcare to the scale and standards required in an evolving and expanding sector, with the citizens of Ireland at its heart as core beneficiaries. </p>  <p>  An independent external contractor has been engaged by my Department to undertake an assessment of the current operating model and to identify options for reform.  An Oversight Group, chaired by my Department, was also established and met regularly throughout the process. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to report that this Review has concluded and a report on the Review has been finalised. I look forward to bringing this report to Government very shortly.  </p></reply>

Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) should be alerted without delay.</p><p>Tusla acts urgently on notification of an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases. Referrals to Tusla increased by 8% in 2021.</p><p>Garda&iacute; have specific powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act to remove a child from a situation of danger, and under Section 13 of that same act, to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla. Tusla will at that point carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. This may in some cases include applying for an Emergency Care Order.  In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm. Where a child is already in care, Tusla will make a determination as to whether the child is safe in their placement or if they need to be moved.</p><p>Tusla has a dedicated social work team for Separated Children Seeking International Protection (SCSIP). Over the past 20 years the SCSIP Team has developed expertise through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in International Refugee Protection Programmes and by caring for separated children seeking international protection who arrive unannounced at  Irish ports, including airports.</p><p>SCSIP who arrive at ports of entry to Ireland are referred to Tusla for a child protection needs assessment. In the first instance, Tusla makes every attempt to contact relatives of the child and to reunite the child with family members or friends. If children cannot be reunified with family or friends, they are received into the care of Tusla.<b></b></p><p>These children are placed by Tusla either in small specialist residential care centres , or with specifically recruited foster families under a F&aacute;ilte Foster care programme. The children are automatically entitled as children in care to a medical card and access to education services.</p><p>In addition, a Social Worker is allocated to them to develop a care plan and monitor the progress of the child / young persons care. The care plan may involve specialist English language tuition, intensive educational supports and therapeutic work in respect of trauma.</p><p>The basis for care of a SCSIP is different from the general child in care population; as they are received into care  for protection and welfare reasons due to their separation from their primary carers, which can be as a consequence of war or persecution.  Children who arrive in Ireland outside of a dedicated refugee programme are supported in their application for refugee status.</p><p>Assisting children with reunification with their families has evolved as a  key piece of the support social workers provide to those who are eligible to apply.  Where relevant the  process of reunification is started as soon as the children come to the attention of Tusla.  </p></reply>

In March 2021 I asked Professor Conor O&rsquo;Mahony, the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, to consider the significant complexities and challenges which arise in relation to the issue of illegal birth registrations, and to provide a report proposing an appropriate course of action. On 14th March 2022 I published the report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations.  </p><p>In reflecting on these recommendations, I am pleased to confirm that the <b>Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022</b>can and will robustly fulfil the vast majority of the recommendations.  In particular, it will provide for access to records; access to counselling and related supports; access to a statutory tracing service, including genealogy expertise and facilitated contact with family; an accurate birth registration; official recognition of the identity by which a person has lived; a specialist tracing service; and safeguarding of records.  In addition, I am happy to move forward on recommendation 16 regarding a payment towards legal costs associated with, for example, a declaration of parentage, and have announced a once-off payment of &euro;3,000 to the individuals affected by confirmed illegal birth registration in the files of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild.  </p><p>One of the recommendations relates to a State inquiry into illegal adoption.  In reflecting on this recommendation, it is important to firstly emphasise that the Government remains committed to delivering on the comprehensive suite of actions set out in the Government <i>Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions</i>. These actions respond to the priority needs and wishes of survivors, their families and advocates.  As part of this work, I am advancing an initiative for Recognition and Memorialisation of the Voices and Lived Experiences of Survivors. This will establish a process for survivors of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions to come forward voluntarily and share the account of their lived experience, with a view to having it formally recognised as part of the official record of the history of these institutions in Ireland.  This work fulfils one of the core objectives of any truth commission, namely providing official recognition of the lived experience of the affected people. </p><p>The question of creating an effective non-statutory inquiry is a sensitive, complex and challenging one.  The Special Rapporteur acknowledges this and, in particular, notes the challenges associated with access to records for a non-statutory inquiry.  Again, the Government Action Plan contains important measures in this regard which are focused on access to records and the creation of a centralised State repository of records.  In doing so, the Government recognises the potential for a future centralised archive to support further analysis and research on these important matters.</p><p>As a consequence of all of this ongoing work, the Government will need to give further consideration to this specific recommendation.</p><p>In the coming months, my priority will be to drive forward the Action Plan and deliver the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, which will provide full, unredacted access to birth and early life information for people affected by illegal birth registrations, adopted people, and anyone with questions as to their origins. </p><p>In relation to Deputy Bacik's question about the Adoption ( Regularisation) Bill 2019, I understand that this Bill sought to bring certainty to those whose births were illegally registered. Part 8 of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 achieves this certainty by providing important mechanisms for persons whose births were illegally registered. A new register will be established that will reflect the person&rsquo;s social identity and a certificate from that register will be recognised as the person&rsquo;s birth certificate for all lawful purposes, where that is the person's wish. It will also provide a means to legally recognise the affected person&rsquo;s relationship with the parents who raised them, where that is their wish. Furthermore, I brought an amendment at committee stage which affords assurances to those whose births were illegally registered that any transaction entered into by a person in their social identity will not be invalidated because they were the subject of an illegal birth registration. </p></reply>

This is in parallel with the IPAS critical incident policy. </p>  <p>  The policy has been in operation since June 2021. This policy is intended to balance the need for openness and transparency in all State organisations in the provision of information to the public, with the expectation of privacy and consideration of the sensitive nature surrounding the death of any individual for their family and friends. </p>  <p>  In the case of international protection applicants, regard must also be had for the legal obligation to protect the anonymity of international protection applicants during the protection process.

More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p><p>To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme. </p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p><p>Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21%. <table>    <tr>       <th>National Vacancy Rate By   Age (June 2021)</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Up to 1 year (0-12 months)</td>       <td>20%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 year+ to 2 years (13-24 months)</td>       <td>10%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 years+ to 3 years (25-36 months)</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 years+ to 4 years (37-48 months)</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months) Non-School-Going</td>       <td>12%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months) School-Going</td>       <td>42%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months)   Non-school going</td>       <td>30%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months) School going</td>       <td>48%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 years+ to 8 years (73-96 months)</td>       <td>37%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8 years+</td>       <td>34%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>21%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Moreover, recent Tusla data shows that the number of services notifying their closure to Tusla in 2021 is less than the number of service closures that occurred in 2020 and 2019. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>ELC Closures</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th>ELC New Registrations</th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>2021 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Full year </td>       <td>196 </td>       <td>197 </td>       <td>141 </td>       <td>93 </td>       <td>91 </td>       <td>65 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department is continuing to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, with a particular focus on monitoring Covid-19 impacts as public health restrictions have been lifted and responding to the unmet early learning and childcare needs of families.</p><p>Pobal has, using the data captured in June 2021 and current registration data, recently projected vacancy rates in February 2022. While this analysis shows a fall in vacancy rates from June 2021 to February 2022 &ndash; with vacancy rates falling from 21% to 19%, this analysis suggests that there is unused capacity across the country. Further analysis is being undertaken by Pobal to establish if this unused capacity varies by type of provision or location, to establish the degree of mismatch is supply and demand for certain cohorts or children or in certain areas.</p><p>Pobal will also commence new data collection in April 2022, as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey. This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established. </p><p>In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery so, for example, greater funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, CCC are currently proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to identify unused capacity and explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of unmet early learning and childcare needs of families.</p><p>Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

Throughout recent weeks and months officials have provided detailed briefing to me on the assessment of need process and its related issues. Against this backdrop I strongly supported and welcomed the significant additional funding provided in this year&rsquo;s budget to the HSE to enhance the development of Children&rsquo;s Network Disability Teams across the country. The recently approved and published HSE National Service Plan demonstrates a strong commitment by the HSE to continued improvement in disability services. I very much welcome the recent publication of the Disability Capacity Review which it is hoped will provide a future road map for expansion and improvement of disability services.  In addition I meet regularly with Minister Rabbitte on all important areas. In the context of the recent High Court Judgement in relation to the Assessment of Need Standard Operation Procedure, I have been briefed that the Department of Health officials are engaging with the HSE to consider the impact and appropriate steps.</p>  <p>AIM is a programme of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access and meaningfully participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) pre-school programme.  AIM offers tailored, practical supports based on need and does not require a formal diagnosis of disability.  It should be noted that a formal diagnosis of disability does not guarantee additional supports under AIM, as it may be found that existing supports are sufficient to ensure a child&rsquo;s meaningful participation in the ECCE programme. The HSE form part of our structures and we engage from time to time on issues of assessment of need for therapeutic support.  Other types of supports range from specific equipment and capital grants to assessing appropriate medical supports for children to enable them to attend preschool.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-24a.70.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032400047#WRC01300"><p>In the first instance I would like to acknowledge the negative impact that Covid-19 has had on all our people both young and old. I would also like to commend our children and young people for the way they have dealt with the impact of the pandemic on their lives. The loss of social outlets during lockdowns has been felt across our society and my Department has put a number of measures in place to aid the recovery of our children and young people from the impacts of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  Clearly, one of the key issues for children and young people is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures. I know all children and young people have been significantly adversely impacted by the events of recent years, with school closures, changed or reduced availability of certain services, as well as causing disruption to children and young people&rsquo;s social lives. Moreover, some reports have demonstrated that the pandemic had particularly adverse impacts on those who are most vulnerable in our society. </p>  <p>  My Department is working to ensure that we have an equitable recovery from this pandemic. My department is currently developing a successor policy framework to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, which will run to 2028. Addressing the harm caused to our children and young people will form a key part of the successor policy framework. It will build on the successes of the previous policy, such as the 5 National Outcomes, and elements of the implementation structure which helped to deliver change for children and young people such as the National Advisory Council. However, I am also conscious that the successor policy framework will have to address the many issues children and young people face. I am pleased that my Department recently completed an open, public consultation to inform the successor framework, looking both at what is going well for children and young people, what is not going well, and what actions Government should take to enhance children and young people&rsquo;s lives, especially those who are vulnerable. </p>  <p>  The Growing up in Ireland (GUI) survey has tracked outcomes for children and young people before and during the pandemic. The special GUI Covid survey carried out in December 2020 showed that many 12 year olds participated less in organised activities and many 22 year olds spent less time with friends during the pandemic. Many participants in both groups also reported symptoms of low mood, 22% of 12 year olds and almost half of 22 year olds. GUI is currently collecting data from 13 year olds which will shed light on how they are doing in relation to health, education, socioemotional well-being, activities and relationships in the aftermath of the pandemic. GUI will also survey the older group at the age of 25 in 2023 on these issues, as well as their experiences of employment.</p>  <p>  My Department has a significant role to play in promoting the wellbeing of children and young people, as well as the realisation of children&rsquo;s rights, across Government. I am committed to consulting with our partners within and outside Government on this topic, listening carefully to the results of our recent, public consultation and continuing to study the specific impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on those who are vulnerable to ensure our policy sets out a robust framework for recovery and for improved outcomes for children and young people.</p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, my Department has engaged with children and young people to learn about their experience during the pandemic. In the summer of 2020, my Department, the Department of Health and the youth sector, collaborated with SpunOut.ie to undertake an online survey of young people&rsquo;s experiences of COVID-19. A Youth Advisory Group worked with officers from my Department to guide the development and analysis of the consultation.  The consultation asked young people about what has been working well for them and the challenges in maintaining their wellbeing during COVID-19. This engagement by my Department gave young people a chance to provide us with feedback on what could be useful in improving their mental health and wellbeing over the coming months.</p>  <p>  Children and Young People Services Committees (CYPSC) responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and utilised my Department&rsquo;s programme funding to help coordinate initiatives in response to identified needs for children and young people and their families.  Examples of this important work included the delivery of school meals, family educational and activity packs, and food packs to local families. This work was done in collaboration with local partners in the Community &amp;amp; Voluntary sector, such as the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance.  This work is ongoing, with CYPSCs continuing to identify and address the needs of disadvantaged communities throughout the pandemic. </p>  <p>  Given the importance of early learning and childcare for children, their families, and society more broadly, I put in place a range of supports for the early learning and childcare sector since the onset of Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  During periods of closure and restricted access to services, supports had included tailored funding arrangements a range of capital programmes, an antigen programme, sector-specific infection prevention and control guidance, and access to the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). </p>  <p>  Ensuring that early learning and childcare services continue to operate safely for children, families and staff, is among the key objectives of these supports.</p>  <p>Supporting parents and enabling them to fulfil their roles will be vital as the country recovers from the impacts of the pandemic.  My Department is currently finalising a national model for parenting supports, which seeks to support all parents to be confident and capable in their parenting role, and to achieve the best outcomes for children and families. The model will be published later this year, and recognises the importance of all persons who play a parenting role in the lives of children and young people.   </p></reply>

AIM is a programme of supports designed to enable children with a disability to access and meaningfully participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. The goal of AIM is to create a more inclusive environment in pre-schools, so all children, regardless of ability, can benefit from quality early learning and care. The model achieves this by providing universal supports to pre-school settings, and targeted supports, which focus on the needs of the individual child, without requiring a diagnosis of disability.</p>  <p>  In addition to the specific services my Department delivers for children with disabilities, my Department co-ordinates the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) which is whole-of-government strategy for policy and action to address the needs of persons with disabilities in Ireland and support effective progress in delivering on the obligations set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) which Ireland ratified in 2018. This process allows for robust and ongoing consultation and cooperation between Departments.</p>  <p>  I chair the NDIS Steering Group and one of the focuses of that Strategy, alongside the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES), is improving transitions across state services, including for children. In that regard, both the NDIS and CES involve extensive input from officials in the Departments of Health and Education.

The networks help to support integrated and co-ordinated supports for children, young people and families at local community level.  Members of CFSNs come from a variety of agencies and local community and voluntary services such as primary care, social work, early years services, sports clubs, youth probation services, schools, etc. There are two of these networks in County Louth. CFSNs also facilitate the coordination of the use of Meitheal, the Tusla-led early intervention national practice model that identifies a child&rsquo;s and their families&rsquo; needs and strengths, and brings together a team around the child to deliver preventative support. </p>  <p>  Tusla will continue to provide services in Louth via its Prevention, Partnership and Family Support Programme.  This includes Tusla&rsquo;s family support teams, its child and family support network coordinators and Springboard family support service.  Tusla will also continue to support and fund commissioned family support services in Louth.  </p>  <p>  Tusla is currently working as part of the Children Services Strategy Group with its partners in Northern Ireland to submit an application under the Peace Plus funding stream which is likely to include family support.  Tusla continues to work and support the MACE project (which was under the previous cross border funding stream) which focuses on services and interventions for children who have experienced multiple adverse experiences.</p>  <p>  Tusla has worked with partners and stakeholders to develop a parenting plan for Louth Meath and also has a number of initiatives that are being supported via the Louth Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committee (CYPSC) such as Trauma Informed Training.

This responsibility includes the accommodation needs of young persons leaving all forms of State care.  </p>  <p>  Policy responsibility for homeless young people, insofar as it extends to my Department, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991. Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care by the Child and Family Agency. Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided with accommodation under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.</p>  <p>  My Department also has responsibility for after care provision, for young people leaving care.  Currently, those care-leavers who are at risk of homeless are assisted by the Child and Family Agency, in partnership with other Government Departments or agencies. This includes finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing, or facilitating independent living. Since 2017, care-leavers have also been included as a separate category for funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS). This scheme provides targeted assistance to the most vulnerable care leavers by enabling Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to acquire residential units to accommodate them. </p>  <p>  While the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has ultimate responsibility for managing homelessness, my Department is committed to addressing homelessness as part of a whole-of-Government response including contributing to the development of a Youth Homeless Strategy.

A recent review of the NCS showed that:</p><p>- 38% of families reported that half or more of their early learning and childcare costs were covered by the NCS;</p><p>- 56% reported that they had more money to spend; and</p><p>- 28% reported that they were working more (with 8% reporting they would not be in work without the NCS). </p><p>I recognise however that the burden on some families remains high and we need to do more to ensure affordability.</p><p>The recommendations of an Expert Group to develop a new funding model for early learning and childcare were adopted by Government in December. This new funding model marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services.</p><p>An essential and top priority for the Funding Model Expert Group was to make recommendations for a mechanism to control fee rates for different types of provision for early learning and childcare.</p><p>There are four specific recommendations on fee management, including the introduction of a fee freeze in the first instance, improvements to price comparability, and developments to the fee management system further to the assessment of cost data. </p><p>Fee management will start with a requirement of providers not to increase fees on September 2021 levels. The fee management system will be further developed in subsequent years, informed by income and cost data analysis.</p><p>The Expert Group made a further three specific recommendations on affordability, including amendments to the NCS and further development of subsidies linked to household income and expenditure or other criteria.</p><p>The Expert Group report informed the transformative package of measures for the sector committed to in Budget 2022, including the new &euro;221 million Core Funding stream. Core Funding will operate from September 2022 to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability. </p><p>Core Funding will have a contractual requirement that fees are not greater than September 2021 levels. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the NCS and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.</p><p>Budget 2022 also introduced two changes to the NCS:</p><p>- Extension of the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefitting up to 40,000 children.</p><p>-Discontinuation of the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours from spring 2022, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families</p><p>Since the start of the pandemic, my Department has been aiming to ensure the sustainability of services and prevent the additional costs from public health measures being passed on to parents. ELC and SAC employers will continue to benefit from the exemption to the turnover rule for the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) until April 2022. </p><p>In advance of the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund will be available to providers, contingent on an agreement not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. This fund will operate from the end of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme until the introduction of Core Funding.</p><p>Government has approved the recommendations of the Expert Group.  Core Funding and the changes to NCS introduced in Budget 2022 begin the implementation of many of these wide ranging recommendations. Implementation will be further progressed in the coming years as additional funding is secured through the annual Estimates process. </p><p>The fee management system, in tandem with developments to the NCS will together deliver improved affordability for families.  </p></reply>

It represents a whole of Government approach and brings Government Departments and Agencies together with representatives of Traveller and Roma communities to focus on key issues in a structured. I chair the NTRIS Steering Committee.  </p>  <p>  My Department has an important funding role and provides funding to support a range of activities linked to NTRIS actions and to provide core funding to a number of Traveller and Roma organisations.  </p>  <p>  I secured a budget of &euro;5.659m for 2022, and this funding will be used to provide core funding to a number of Traveller and Roma Organisations.  The funding will also be used to support a number of important initiatives and projects, for example, employment projects, education projects, a number of social inclusion and cultural projects, mediation and counselling services and others. </p>  <p>  The Covid19 pandemic has highlighted the specific nature and extent of the needs of the Roma and Traveller communities and I have secured an additional &euro;880,000 in Dormant Account Funds which will be used to support a number of specific projects to support the communities in 2022. </p>  <p>  Key projects funded </p>  <p>  - School attendance is a specific challenge for some members of the Traveller and Roma communities. My Department is providing funding for a Pilot Programme to target attendance, participation and retention/school completion in specific Traveller and Roma Communities. The pilot teams work together with parents, children and young people, schools, Traveller and Roma communities and service providers to remove the barriers impacting on Traveller and Roma children&rsquo;s attendance, participation and retention in education.  The pilots are taking place in Galway, Wexford, Dublin and Cork.  </p>  <p>  - Employment is also an ongoing challenge in the Traveller and Roma community.  My Department funds the Special Initiative for Travellers (SIT) to provide support for practical approaches to redressing the imbalance in Traveller under-employment, to support Travellers already engaged in the Traveller economy and provide other supports, including training, to address the needs of Travellers. The SIT funding includes Support Workers and assistance for employment and enterprise development. There are currently SITs in seven locations around Ireland.   </p>  <p>  - My Department funds both the Traveller Mediation Service and the Traveller Counselling Service.  One of Traveller Mediation Service&rsquo;s unique attributes is that it employs Travellers as mediators who have the necessary understanding of Traveller culture and who inspire confidence in Travellers to avail of the service.  </p>  <p>  - My Department also funds the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum which is working to empower Traveller Women.  Additional funding was provided for community projects that support and promote leadership roles for Traveller and Roma Women.</p>  <p>  - My Department has worked to advance projects that increase the visibility of Traveller culture and heritage.  It has provided funding for Traveller Pride Week to empower national, regional and local organisations to celebrate Traveller and Roma culture and diversity. </p>  <p>  - My Department is also progressing a project with the National Museum of Ireland to develop an online portal to the Traveller Culture collections.  This programme will see the creation of an online portal of objects, archives, photography, recordings and other collections held in the National Cultural Institutions and National Folklore Archive illustrative of or, pertaining to Traveller culture and history.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to a review of the Strategy and I will work with stakeholders to reviewing what has been achieved, and to developing new approaches, as necessary, with a particular focus on implementation and measurement. Proposals for an evaluation of the processes for implementation of three equality strategies - the Migrant Integration Strategy, the National Strategy for Women and Girls and NTRIS, which all concluded last year, have been sought. It is expected that the contract will be signed very shortly with work commencing in March and concluding in quarter three this year.</p>  <p>  The reason for proceeding with an evaluation process that spans a number of equality strategies is to place the focus on implementation and to identify potential good practice in some areas that can be transferred to others.  The objectives of our equality strategies remain largely relevant and the key challenge is to ensure better delivery.  The issue of intersectionality also needs to be addressed in a more coherent manner.  </p>  <p>  The current NTRIS Steering Committee is remaining in operation during the Review process and our next meeting is scheduled for the end of March.  Work will continue on implementing NTRIS&rsquo;s actions, many of which remain highly relevant.   </p>  <p>  The Strategy Committee&rsquo;s role will also be pivotal in developing the consultation process and the content for the successor strategy. The advice provided by Traveller and Roma organisations will directly shape the scope and focus of the next strategy. </p></reply>

It is a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to employment of all persons with disabilities. The CES&rsquo;s strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide co-ordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent chairperson, Mr Fergus Finlay. Currently the group is developing a final Action Plan for the period 2022 &ndash; 2024. </p>  <p>  There have been a number of successful steps forward that we have taken under the CES to date. One such success is the decision to allow all young people leaving school or rehabilitative training to defer their day service placement by up to 3 years to allow them to pursue other opportunities such as further education or employment.</p>  <p>  Other key areas of progress include the ongoing implementation of specific recommendations arising from the Make Work Pay Report and the production by the Public Appointment Service of a Guide to Promoting Inclusive Employment, the &lsquo;Towards Work&rsquo; Project and &lsquo;Employers for Change: A Disability Information Service&rsquo; which provides expert peer source of advice and information on employing staff with disabilities.</p>  <p>  There are also several grants available to employers to make their workplaces more disability-friendly such as the Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant, the Personal Reader Grant, the Job Interview Interpreter Grant; and the Employee Retention Grant.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing the target of persons with disabilities employed in the public sector from 3% to 6%. This new target will be enshrined in primary legislation (the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill) which is currently being drafted and will be introduced to the Houses shortly. </p></reply>

The National Centre will stand as a National Memorial in honour of those who were resident in Mother and Baby Homes, County Homes, Industrial Schools, Magdalene Laundries and related institutions. </p>  <p>  This project also provides a basis for several other interdependent initiatives. I believe that this project will make a significant contribution in our journey of recognising and learning from the failures of the past, acknowledging the hurt which continues to be felt by survivors, and seeking to rebuild a relationship of trust with those who were so profoundly wronged.  </p>  <p>  The Secretary General to the Government has been appointed to lead a cross-Government process to advance work on a National Memorial and Records Centre. Funding has been provided to support this work in 2022. The National Centre will be designed to include an archive of records relating to institutional trauma, alongside personal accounts of survivors' lived experiences, as well as presenting the historical and social context. This process, which will include engagement with survivors, will develop an overarching vision and proposed approach for the creation of the National Centre. Once this scoping work is complete, a proposal will be brought to Government for approval.  </p>  <p>  My Department has already appointed an Archivist and established a dedicated Information Management Unit to lead on the preservation of, and access to, records held by the Department, including the Commission&rsquo;s archive. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022, which is making its way through the Oireachtas, will provide an initial legal basis to safeguard all relevant records.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the National Centre, work is being advanced separately with the local authorities to deliver on the commitment to support local memorialisation initiatives across the country. Furthermore, financial support is available from my Department through the Commemorative Grant scheme to support survivor groups in commemorating their experiences in a manner which fits their own specific needs.  </p>  <p>  As we have learned from our consultations, memorialisation is very important to survivors although it can mean many different things to different people.  In recognising this variety of perspectives, further consultation will be undertaken to ensure these developments are informed by those most centrally involved with these experiences.</p></reply>

The other is the Comprehensive Employment Strategy. </p>  <p>  Acknowledging the importance of whole-of-government action on disability issues, it is planned that there will be a successor framework.  It will have to be framed taking account of the need to prioritise implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  In that regard, there are no plans to update the current strategy. </p>  <p>  The NDIS is a key framework for policy and action to address the needs of persons with disabilities in Ireland, and to improve their lives in a practical sense. The NDIS specifically supports effective progress in delivering on the obligations set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, which is chaired by Minister of State for Disability Anne Rabbitte includes representatives of several Government Departments and Agencies and the Disability Stakeholder Group (DSG). </p>  <p>  A Mid Term Review of the NDIS was published in March 2020. The Review sets a framework for action on disability from now until the end of the lifetime of the Strategy. It involved a consultation process with disability stakeholders and with relevant departments and agencies. This process confirmed that stakeholders want the emphasis to be on implementing existing commitments within the Strategy and on fulfilling obligations that arise from Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UNCRPD in 2018. </p>  <p>  The approach being taken to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of progressive realisation, each year moving forward on key reforms, with the obligations arising from the Convention being met over time. Initial priority has been given to meeting legislative commitments. </p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of developing a dedicated UNCRPD Implementation Plan which will provide a whole of Government framework for action to implement UNCRPD.</p></reply>

ECCE is not mandatory but is a very popular scheme, with 95% of children in the eligible age cohort attending ECCE services.</p>  <p>  The upper age limit of 5 years and 6 months for ECCE was set in consultation with the Department of Education and ensures that children transition into primary school with their peers.  In certain circumstances an over age exemption can be given to enable children with additional needs to remain in ECCE past this age limit.</p>  <p>  In making determinations on applications for over age exemptions, my Department is guided by a review of the over-age exemption process which was carried out in 2018 by the National Disability Authority (NDA) for this Department and the Department of Education.</p>  <p>  ‎In their published report, the NDA concluded that it is in the best interest of children with additional needs to transition to primary school with their age cohort, rather than being held back with children of a younger age.  The report also sought to ensure that schools offer all the assistance necessary to meet the child's needs, with the assistance of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  </p>  <p>With regard to the child referred to in the question, he did not meet the criteria for an over-age exemption and had already started in primary school when his parents applied for one.  When his parents contacted my Department they were referred to the NCSE to enable them to get supports needed for their child to continue in primary school.  I understand that the parents chose to withdraw their child from primary school with the intention of re-enrolling him in the 2022/23.  The NCSE will be able to provide supports to help the parents and child to prepare for a return to school.   </p></reply>

The most recent available data indicates the average hourly wage for non-managerial staff in the sector in 2021 was &euro;12.60, with many staff working part-time or on temporary contracts. These data underscore the need for significant improvement in both pay and conditions of employment. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the State is not the employer, and my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff in the sector. However, I am doing all that is in my power to address the issue. </p><p>In particular, I began a process in December 2020 to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee, which began meeting in December 2021.  </p><p>Supported by the new Core Funding stream I announced in Budget 2022, there is now a real prospect of improvement in pay and conditions through the Joint Labour Committee. The scale of allocation under the new Core Funding stream - which is &euro;73.5m in 2022 and equivalent to more than &euro;221m in a full year - will, among a number of objectives, enable providers to meet the conditions that may be set in an Employment Regulation Order.  </p><p>In addition, in December 2021, I published &quot;Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028&quot;, which includes commitments to develop career pathways, promote careers in the sector, and strengthen supports for continuing professional development, which will complement efforts to improve pay and conditions of employment in the sector. </p><p>On this issue of capacity, the availability of high-quality early learning and childcare that is affordable and accessible is a key Government priority.  To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme.  </p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p><p>Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21%. <table>    <tr>       <th>National Vacancy Rate By Age (June 2021)</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Up to 1 year (0-12 months)</td>       <td>20%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 year+ to 2 years (13-24 months)</td>       <td>10%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 years+ to 3 years (25-36 months)</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 years+ to 4 years (37-48 months)</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months)   Non-School-Going</td>       <td>12%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months)   School-Going</td>       <td>42%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months)   Non-school going</td>       <td>30%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months) School   going</td>       <td>48%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 years+ to 8 years (73-96 months)</td>       <td>37%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8 years+</td>       <td>34%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>21%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department is continuing to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, particularly in light of the recent lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. </p><p>Pobal has, using the data captured in June 2021 and current registration data, recently projected vacancy rates in February 2022. While this analysis shows a fall in vacancy rates from June 2021 to February 2022 &ndash; with vacancy rates falling from 21% to 19%, this analysis suggests that there is unused capacity across the country. Further analysis is being undertaken by Pobal to establish if this unused capacity varies by type of provision or location, to establish the degree of mismatch is supply and demand for certain cohorts or children or in certain areas. Pobal will also commence new data collection in April 2022, as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey. This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established and will inform the necessary steps to be taken by my Department to address any issue of under supply, in addition to steps already in train. </p><p>Existing steps include:</p><p>- The new funding model, to roll out in September, which will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery so, for example, greater funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children. </p><p>- An allocation of &euro;70m under revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. </p><p>- An updating of the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings, by my Department in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG) </p><p>- Proactive engagement of City/County Childcare Committees with early learning and childcare services in areas where there is unmet need for early learning and childcare from families.</p></reply>

The commitment not to increase fees will ensure that the full affordability benefits of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) are felt by parents.</p><p>Core Funding is equivalent to &euro;221 million in a full programme year. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million will be distributed based on the capacity that the service is offering to provide (child places, age groups, hours and weeks).  &euro;38 million will be distributed in line with ELC graduate qualifications of ELC Lead Educators and Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services.</p><p>The development of Core Funding is a significant milestone on the journey towards a new funding model. It aims to transform of the sector and establish a new type of partnership between providers and the State that reflects the importance of ELC and SAC for the public good. </p><p>On Monday 7<sup>th</sup>March I wrote to ELC and SAC providers to provide detailed information on how Core Funding will operate and to provide the rates at which it will be paid.  I also launched an online tool or Ready Reckoner which allows ELC and SAC providers to see the potential impact of this funding on their individual service. The Core Funding Ready Reckoner is accessible to all on the Early Years Hive and is designed to give an idea of what services can expect to receive based on their characteristics and to allow different scenarios of provision to be tested. Further information is available on the website of the Early Years Hive and support, guidance and training is available through City and County Childcare Committees. </p><p>The key dates in preparation for Core Funding becoming operational for the 2022/2023 programme year are: </p><p>- 7<sup>th</sup>March: The online tool (Ready Reckoner) becomes available to provide approximate estimates of potential Core Funding values for individual services</p><p>Stage 1 of the application process opens in April: </p><p>- Begins with the Sector Profile and Income and Costs  Survey, which is a pre-requisite for application for Core Funding</p><p>Stage 2 of the application process opens in June: </p><p>- Providers define their service&rsquo;s profile and their  capacity in detail in an online form</p><p>- Core Funding value is communicated to providers  (subject to final verifications and confirmations)</p><p>- The provider contract will be published so applicants  can review what they will later be asked to sign</p><p>Stage 3 of the application process opens in August: </p><p>- Individual contracts will start to be made available  to successful applicants for signature</p><p>- End August: payments to providers commence. Payments  will be made monthly in advance throughout the programme year.</p><p>In the interim period, until April 2022, ELC and SAC employers continue to be eligible to access the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) without having to demonstrate the reduction in turnover which is required of other employers.  EWSS has provided very substantial investment in the sector since August 2020. Following the cessation of EWSS at end April 2022, ELC and SAC providers will have access to a Transition Fund between May and August in advance of the introduction of Core Funding from September. An announcement with further detail on the Transition Fund is due to be made shortly.  </p></reply>

It was originally announced in Budget 2022 and is informed by recommendations of an Expert Group to design a new funding model for the sector that were adopted by Government in December.</p>  <p>  Core Funding marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services.</p>  <p>  Core Funding will be available to registered ELC and SAC providers, including full day care providers, ECCE-only providers, and stand-alone school-age providers, subject to the service agreeing to come into contract for the scheme. It will be a payment directly to services who choose to participate in the scheme.</p>  <p>  The total available budget for Core Funding is equivalent to &euro;221 million in a full programme year, contingent on an Employment Regulation Order being agreed by the Joint Labour Committee. Core Funding will be allocated to services based on their capacity and the qualifications of those working in a service. The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity. </p>  <p>  The remaining &euro;38 million will be distributed to services with ELC graduate Lead Educators/Managers through the ELC Graduate Premium. The ELC Graduate Premium is calculated based on the number of hours of provision led by ELC graduate; and if the ELC or combined ELC and SAC service has an ELC graduate as the Manager.</p>  <p>  The overwhelming majority of ELC and SAC services will see substantial increases in income through the new Core Funding model. </p>  <p>  Approximately 1% of services will see the same income from Core Funding to what they have received this year. These are services which have benefited disproportionately from a previous disparity in the funding model for graduates working in ELC services.  </p>  <p>  My Department has issued a funding guarantee to providers whereby all services will receive at least the same level of funding in Core Funding as they received from higher capitation and Programme Support Payments in the 2021/22 programme year, assuming the numbers of children, graduate staff and type of service offered remains the same.</p>  <p>  The structure of Core Funding is based on the recommendations of the Expert Group outlined in Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children's attendance. Providers will have a stable income source based on the service they deliver. </p>  <p>  Core Funding is designed to operate alongside the existing funding schemes, including the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). Therefore, the NCS will continue to provide subsidies for children in attendance and ECCE will continue to provide capitation.</p>  <p>  Services will be required to offer the NCS and/or the ECCE programme to all eligible children/parents, in line with their operations, and will be invited to report on the quality development measures they are pursuing.</p>  <p>  A Ready Reckoner to support services to determine the potential value of Core Funding to their service is available at earlyyearshive.ncs.gov.ie/ReadyReckoner/.</p>  <p>  Participation in Core Funding for ELC and SAC providers will require a commitment not to increase fees to parents from September 2021 rates in return for the increased State funding. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents feel the affordability benefits of the NCS and ECCE, including the full effects of the NCS reforms announced in Budget 2022. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also announced a once-off Transition Fund which will be available to ELC and SAC services from May to August inclusive, during the period between the ending of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) in April and the introduction of a new Core Funding stream in September. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund is that fees to parents do not increase above September 2021 levels.</p>  <p>  The introduction of fee management measures is one of the recommendations of the Expert Group, as approved by Government. Fee management will start with a requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access the new Core Funding scheme and Transition Fund, as outlined above. Further information on proposed fee management mechanisms in the longer term is available in the Group's report, available at: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie </p>  <p>  Providers who have increased their fees above September 2021 levels will be required to revert to September 2021 levels before May 2022 to be eligible for the Transition Fund in May 2022. Similarly, to be eligible for the new Core Funding stream, providers who have increased their fees above September 2021 levels will be required to revert to September 2021 levels before September 2022. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also confirmed that ELC and SAC employers will continue to benefit from the exemption to the turnover rule for the EWSS until April 2022, in part to avoid the additional costs arising from public health measures being passed on to parents.  </p>  <p>  The EWSS has been available to employers in the sector since August 2020. Enhanced EWSS rates (from October 2020-January 2022) amount to approximately &euro;34 million per month for the sector, covering on average 80% of payroll costs and 50% of total operating costs for providers. Standard EWSS (from August 2020-October 2020 and for February 2022) amount to approximately &euro;22 million per month for the sector, covering on average 50% of payroll costs and 38% of total operating costs for providers. A new EWSS flat rate of &euro;100 that will apply from March-April 2022 will amount to approximately &euro;11 million per month for the sector, covering on average, 25% staff costs or 11% total operating costs. </p>  <p>  Given the level of investment being made available to the sector through EWSS, it is difficult to see any justification for an increase in fees at this time.</p>  <p>  ‎‎Sustainability Funding also continues to be available to providers where there are sustainability difficulties and I have requested that providers would exhaust this route before considering increases in fees for parents. I encourage providers to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee if they require any further information or support.</p>  <p>  Core Funding is part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to realising the First 5 target of investment of approximately &euro;1 billion by 2028. Core Funding introduces a strategic way of funding the sector and begins to implement the recommendations of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model. </p></reply>

The Action Plan is a high-level framework to drive, monitor and report on implementation of the 22 wide-ranging measures announced by Government in responding to the needs and concerns of those who spent time in these institutions.  </p>  <p>  Each action identifies key strategic milestones and related timelines. Of the 22 actions, 6 have already been completed while another 13 are currently in progress. Work is ongoing in all thematic areas to advance measures in accordance with the published Action Plan. My Department and other state authorities are working to ensure survivors see tangible results as early as possible. </p>  <p>  In addition to an annual progress report, to be laid before the Houses, my Department will prepare quarterly progress updates.  The first of these updates was published in February on my Department's website. It was also issued directly to every person who provided their contact information to my Department's dedicated mailing list. </p>  <p>  The following are some examples of our progress to date. </p>  <p>  Firstly, dedicated professional counselling support continues to be available nationwide with services being prioritised for survivors. </p>  <p>  A centre-piece of the Government&rsquo;s response is the development of a scheme to provide financial payments and a form of enhanced medical card. On 16th November 2021, the Government approved proposals for a Scheme to be known as the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme. The legislation required to establish the Scheme is currently being developed as a matter of priority, with a view to opening the Scheme for applications in 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department has also published two substantial pieces of draft legislation this year. </p>  <p>  The Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 was published on 12 January and has just passed Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. This legislation will provide a full and clear right of access to birth certificates, birth and early life information for all persons who were adopted, boarded out, the subject of an illegal birth registration or who otherwise have questions in relation to their origins.</p>  <p>  The Institutional Burials Bill 2022 was published on 22 February. The Bill passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 3 March. The children in Tuam deserve an appropriate burial and I am determined to deliver legislation which achieves this dignity for them and their families and provides a clear legal basis should such intervention be necessary at other locations.  </p>  <p>  I established a dedicated Information Management Unit, with a professional archivist, to manage the Commission&rsquo;s archive of records and provide access for individuals to their personal information. So far, we have received 562 Subject Access Requests for information from the archive, and we have issued replies to 480 of these requests, with the remainder in progress.</p>  <p>  On 10 March 2022, the Minister for Health signed the new Data Protection Act 2018 (Access Modifications) (Health) Regulations 2022.  The Regulations have a positive impact as it will no longer be mandatory in all cases to consult the individual&rsquo;s health practitioner before releasing their health data to them. My Department is reviewing all Subject Access Request responses and working to provide health data to individuals as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  On the theme of Education and Research, my Department is funding a new Postgraduate Scholarship in Childhood Disadvantage in memory of all the children who died in Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions. In conjunction with the Irish Research Council, I hope to be able to announce details of the first research projects to be funded in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is developing central guidance to assist local authorities in facilitating local memorialisation in line with the wishes of survivors. In addition, he is in the final stages of preparing a circular which will issue to all planning authorities advising on the approach they should take to protecting possible burial sites in their area from potentially harmful development. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the urgency and sensitivity of this work and it is an absolute priority for myself and the Government.</p></reply>

This sets out a new approach to State funding of the ELC and SAC sector that includes: </p><p>- A new additional funding stream for the sector, Core Funding, to support quality of provision, improved pay and conditions for staff, management of parental fees and sustainability of services </p><p>- Universal and targeted Tackling Disadvantage funding and support, building on Core Funding.  </p><p>- Continued provision of the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) with enhancements </p><p>- An expanded role for the State in managing and supporting supply, quality, accessibility, and affordability</p><p>A number of research inputs contributed to this work including a paper on &ldquo;Approaches to Identifying Children or Settings in Need of Additional Support&rdquo; and another on &ldquo;Funding Models Addressing Early Childhood Disadvantage&rdquo;. There was also extensive and detailed stakeholder consultation on the issue of addressing disadvantage. The Expert Group was also briefed on the DEIS model. </p><p>Of 25 recommendations in Partnership for the Public Good, 9 relate to issues of disadvantage.</p><p>In Budget 2022, I secured an additional allocation of &euro;78m for ELC and SAC to commence implementation of these recommendations. Among new measures in 2022 are:</p><p>- The introduction of Core Funding from September 2022 &ndash; a new scheme worth &euro;221 million in a full year.</p><p>- An extension to the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefitting up to 40,000 children.</p><p>- A discontinuation in the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours from spring 2022, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families.</p><p>As recommendation by the Expert Group, once core funding is embedded and changes existing programmes take effect (ECCE and NCS), my Department will progress the development of the Tackling Disadvantage funding and support. Informed by recommendations in Partnership for the Public Good, through this, services will be provided with a proportionate mix of universal and targeted supports to support children and families accessing their services who are experiencing disadvantage. Whilst this will not be a replication of DEIS, it will be informed by that approach.</p></reply>

It is deliberately non-transferable between parents to ensure that both parents are encouraged and supported in taking time out from work to spend time with their child.  This is further supported through the provision of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the entitlement under the 2019 Act is for each parent in their own right and it is not an allocation per family.  The Act was drafted in such a way as to take account of the broad complexion of family life and allows for an entitlement for the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the parent. </p>  <p>  This means that each parent of the child, and their respective spouse, civil partner or cohabitant, is entitled to take parent&rsquo;s leave in respect of that child.  In effect this means that, if the parents of a child are not a couple but are in a separate relationship then their partner is entitled to parent&rsquo;s leave to care for the child.  As such there is no inequality for parents living apart as both can avail of the leave.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to review the relevant provisions with respect to parent's leave entitlements for one parent families.  The Government has, however, made provision in Budget 2022 to increase the number of weeks of Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit available to eligible parents from five weeks to seven weeks from July 2022. It has been decided that the additional two weeks' leave and benefit will apply to parents of children who are under age 2 in July 2022, or adoptive children who have been with their parents for less than two years at that point.</p></reply>

Currently we are developing a communication strategy for the programme, which will include a community engagement strategy and include a process for consulting relevant communities when locating a Reception and Integration Centre in a particular location.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime information on the new model can be found on the new IPSS website at gov.ie/ipss. </p>  <p>  My Department secured funding in the NDP for Early Years, which will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare over the period 2023-2025. This adds to the substantial level of capital investment by the State in recent years through the Department&rsquo;s Annual Capital Programme. My Department is engaging with early learning and childcare services, through City/County Childcare Committees, in areas where there is unmet need for early learning and childcare from families. This engagement will inform the design and rollout of the early learning and childcare capital funding scheme. </p>  <p>  In relation to youth affairs,  it is expected that there will be an engagement in the first quarter of 2023 with the Education and Training Boards and the National Youth Council of Ireland in relation to a capital grant scheme to support minor works and equipment purchases for national youth organisations, local youth clubs and UBU Your Place Your Space funded organisations. The application criteria for the scheme will be updated where appropriate on foot of this engagement.  </p>  <p>  In general my Department closely monitors the capital spending across the Department and when and where appropriate will engage with relevant stakeholders in terms of programme delivery and design.</p></reply>

This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during 2023-2025. </p>  <p>  Investment under the NDP will consist of three pillars: Modernisation, New Capacity and First 5 Initiatives. This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:</p>  <p>  (1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.</p>  <p>  (2) New Capacity: Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.</p>  <p>  In the coming two years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.</p>  <p>  (3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Further information on the Department&rsquo;s NDP allocation and the application process will be communicated to the sector in the near future. The Department advises the services to contact their local County Childcare Committees, who will provide information on future capital supports when it becomes available.  </p></reply>

The Government believes that all relevant parties have a collective responsibility to respond to Ireland's legacy in relation to these institutions. Following Government approval on 16th November 2021 of the proposals for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme, I commenced meetings on an individual basis with each of the organisations involved.  </p>  <p>  So far, meetings have taken place with the 6 Religious Congregations and one lay Catholic organisation concerned and a meeting has also been held with the Church of Ireland. It is my intention to arrange a meeting with the Catholic church hierarchy. The purpose of the meetings to date was to outline the details of the proposed Payment Scheme and to discuss how the Congregation or organisation intended to contribute towards the cost of this Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Government recognises that these discussions are very important to survivors and to the public. They are very important to Government also. In order to allow for open engagement throughout, and in keeping with the standard approach taken to matters of negotiation, it was agreed that this process, while ongoing, would be treated as confidential.</p>  <p>  This does not mean that the process is not transparent or that a full account will not be made to Government in due course. The Congregations have been made aware that I am accountable to the Oireachtas and, as such, will be making a full report available when this process is concluded. I am keen to make progress in the shortest possible timeframe but it is expected that it may take a number of months.</p></reply>

However, 37% of those applications are incomplete and require further action by the applicant. It is the experience of the Passport Service that applicants can take weeks and sometimes even months after they register their application online to submit documents such as birth certificates and witnessed consent forms. </p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the processing time for applications does not begin until applicants submit the supporting documents that are required to complete the application. </p>  <p>  The number of applications registered more than six months ago falls to 11,000 or 6% of the total number of applications in the system. However, 70% of those 11,000 applications require further action by the applicant. The Passport Service simply cannot progress these applications until the applicant submits the additional documents required in order to complete the application.  </p>  <p>  There are currently over 182,000 applications in the Passport Service system. While this is a very high volume of applications, it does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has issued over 264,000 passports this year to date. In fact, in less than three months, the Passport Service has issued 41% of the number of passports issued in all of 2021.  </p>  <p>  As a result of the investment that my Department is making in the Passport Service, the turnaround time for first time applications has recently been reduced from 40 working days to 35 working days even in the context of the unprecedented volume of applications being received. </p></reply>

The generosity of people in Ireland towards Ukraine, the impulse to help those in need, and the strong solidarity with Ukrainians, is very welcome and is to be commended.  People in Ireland who would like to assist are advised to send funds rather than goods. This can be done through donating to established Irish and international humanitarian organisations.</p>  <p>  My Department, through the Irish Aid programme, has responded with an initial &euro;20 million humanitarian aid package, allocated to long-term UN and Red Cross Movement partners already on active on the ground in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  This cash has enabled immediate assistance to be delivered to Ukrainians in need, including those that have been displaced by the conflict, and to enable the work of those seeking to establish vital humanitarian corridors. A dedicated call for proposals for Irish NGOs ready to respond is also being launched. </p>  <p>  Separately, pre-positioned Irish Aid funds meant that UN agencies were able to respond from the first day of the invasion &ndash; for example, Ireland is among the top ten donors to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which has released over &euro;50 million already to its Ukraine response</p>  <p>  Working with the HSE though the coordinated EU Civil Protection Mechanism, Irish Aid has supported the dispatch of urgent medical supplies to Ukraine.  Use of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism ensures fast and targeted provision of needed supplies, and helps avoid clogging of supply lines with unnecessary goods.</p>  <p>  Given that the Irish Aid emphasis is to provide financial support to agencies already active on the ground, it is not clear what role regional airports might play in supporting my Department&rsquo;s response. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage represents Ireland in the European Civil Protection Mechanism and may have views on what role, if any, regional airports might play as part of the coordinated EU response.</p></reply>

This followed the announcement on 28 February 2022 by ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan that he had decided to begin the process of opening a formal investigation into the situation in Ukraine. </p>  <p>  As Ukraine is not a party to the Rome Statute of the Court, any investigation of the situation there would require the authorisation of the Court&rsquo;s Pre-Trial Chamber, which is a lengthy process.  That process can be avoided if a state party to the Statute refers the situation to the Prosecutor's Office. </p>  <p>  It was for this reason that Ireland and 40 other states parties referred the situation in Ukraine to the Prosecutor, enabling him to immediately begin an investigation into alleged crimes currently unfolding in Ukraine and to commence evidence-collection. </p>  <p>  The Prosecutor previously established that there was a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Crimea and war crimes in Eastern Ukraine since 2014. The recent Russian invasion of Ukraine has, of course, drastically escalated the conflict beyond Eastern Ukraine. </p>  <p>  The Prosecutor has now deployed an investigation team to the region that has already commenced evidence-collection activities and his Office has established a dedicated portal through which any person who may hold information relevant to the Ukraine situation can contact ICC investigators. </p>  <p>  By joining the referral of the situation in Ukraine to the ICC, Ireland has demonstrated its strong commitment to international justice as well as to accountability for atrocity crimes arising out of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Ireland, together with its EU partners, has been a consistent and strong supporter of the ICC and will continue to support its important work. </p></reply>

I have raised many of the issues contained in the report directly with the Government of Israel, including on my visits to the region. I have also discussed these issues regularly with my EU partners. Ireland highlights many of the concerns in the report at the UN Security Council, most recently on 22 March at a meeting of the Council on the Middle East.</p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned at discriminatory practices by Israeli authorities towards Palestinians and the ongoing issues of settlements, demolitions and the designation of Palestinian NGOs as by Israeli authorities. Ireland has been vocal on these issues across a range of settings, both bilaterally and in international fora. </p>  <p>  On my visit to the occupied Palestinian territory in November last year, I saw the impact that settlements are having on Palestinian communities. I am particularly concerned about developments in strategically sensitive areas around East Jerusalem. During the same visit, I conveyed these concerns to the Israeli Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid in the strongest terms. At the UN Security Council, Ireland made a joint press statement with France and Estonia in January, which urged Israel not to proceed with new outline plans for construction in East Jerusalem.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that there is considerable strength of feeling on this subject and accept much of what is outlined in the Amnesty report. Findings by civil society organisations are an important source in the ongoing process of policy formation, and my Department continually examines the decisions that we take towards encouraging the peace process that can deliver a two-State Solution. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to engage with parties in the EU and at the UN Security Council and convey our concerns clearly. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to a two-State Solution that can allow the Israeli and Palestinian peoples to live side by side in peace and we will work with partners to revive a political process in line with international law, which ensures equal rights and is acceptable to both parties.</p></reply>

These sanctions have been adopted in close cooperation with partners, including the US, UK and Canada. The measures adopted to date target the financial, energy, technology and defence, airspace and transport and media sectors, in both Russia and, to a lesser extent, Belarus. Trade between the EU and the two breakaway regions in Donetsk and Luhansk has been restricted, and the export to Russia of a range of luxury goods has been banned.  Individual sanctions have been imposed on almost 700 decision makers, military figures, oligarchs and propagandists and fourteen entities since 23 February. </p>  <p>  The impact of sanctions on the Russian economy has been swift. In response, Russia has published a list of &ldquo;unfriendly countries&rdquo; (and territories), which includes all EU Member States, as well as the US, Canada, UK, and others who have imposed sanctions.</p>  <p>  The EU has also provided &euro;500 million in military assistance to Ukraine, comprised of &euro;450 million in lethal and &euro;50 million in non-lethal aid through the European Peace Facility (EPF). Ireland constructively abstained on the lethal equipment package but will pay our full share (approximately &euro;11 million), directed to non-lethal elements. At our meeting in Brussels on Monday, EU Foreign Ministers also signalled their political approval for an additional &euro;500 million in military support. In line with the commitments in the Programme for Government, Ireland&rsquo;s total share will again go towards non-lethal elements. </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU Membership. EU leaders have acted swiftly in inviting the European Commission to submit its opinion on Ukraine's application to become a member. The EU membership process has legalities and benchmarks which need to be met. We should not forget that there are other countries pursuing this process. That needs to be managed sensitively. We all recognise that the Ukrainian people are upholding the fundamental values at the heart of the European Union, in many cases with their own lives.</p>  <p>  The EU agreed on the 4 March 2022 to activate the Temporary Protection Directive. This allows for beneficiaries to receive the support and protection of the Irish State through a quick and streamlined process. Such people have protection status for up to a year (with a possibility of extension where appropriate so overall period would not exceed three years), and would be entitled to access employment and State supports including, accommodation, healthcare and social welfare on the same basis as Irish Nationals. The decision of 4 March sets out the categories to which the Directive should apply i.e. to Ukrainian nationals who had been residing in Ukraine before 24 February 2022 and their family members. The Decision also applies to stateless persons, and nationals of third countries other than Ukraine, who benefitted from international protection or equivalent national protection in Ukraine before 24 February 2022 and who have been displaced from Ukraine on or after 24 February 2022 plus their family members.  Third Country Nationals and Stateless persons with permanent residence permits granted by the Ukrainian authorities who cannot return safely to country or region of origin, are also eligible for Temporary Protection.</p>  <p>  My Department has already put together a &euro;20 million Irish Aid humanitarian package enabling humanitarian organisations on the ground, including UN agencies and the Red Cross Movement, to provide life-saving assistance to the people of Ukraine. Urgently needed medical supplies from Irish stocks are being made available through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM).</p>  <p>  On 17 March the EU agreed to allow Frontex provide Moldova with operational support for border management. </p>  <p>  To address the question on future challenges for the EU arising from Russia's illegal military aggression in Ukraine: While we cannot predict the future, Ireland has played an active, constructive and compassionate role at EU level in meeting recent challenges. We will continue to do so.</p></reply>

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries. Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania, alongside Turkey, are all currently recognised as candidates for membership of the European Union. </p>  <p>  The European Commission presented Member States with the main findings and recommendations of the seven country reports last October in their &lsquo;Enlargement Package&rsquo;. While situations vary from country to country, the report noted limited progress in the enlargement process overall due to both the impact of the pandemic and ongoing delays and blockages in the enlargement process. It also noted a general stagnation in progress in the crucial areas of fundamental rights and rule of law.</p>  <p>  While technically remaining the two front-runners in terms of EU accession, there is general agreement within both Council and Commission that both Serbia and Montenegro need to increase the dynamism in their reform agenda. Serbia needs to accelerate its reforms regarding fundamental rights and the rule of law, and make significant progress in the normalisation of relations with Kosovo. More recently it has been noted that a stronger showing of support for EU values will be needed if Serbia is to advance its accession process. </p>  <p>  In Montenegro, more intensive efforts in relation to freedom of expression, media freedom and the fight against corruption and organised crime are required. I have also urged intensified dialogue among all parties in Montenegro to address those issues currently giving rise to tensions within the country.</p>  <p>  Both North Macedonia and Albania have clearly fulfilled the conditions necessary to commence accession negotiations. In our view, shared almost unanimously within the Council, the negotiating frameworks for both countries should be agreed and Intergovernmental Conferences held as soon as possible to start the accession process.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support strongly the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU.</p></reply>

We considered in some detail the most recent developments on the ground and the effectiveness and impact of our response to date, as well as how we can continue to extend and adapt our actions. </p>  <p>  There was widespread agreement that we need to maintain the strongest possible pressure on Russia to bring this war to an end. In that light, we adopted a number of crucial decisions to extend our political and practical support for Ukraine and for Ukrainians affected by this conflict.</p>  <p>  We decided that we would advance with the adoption of a second package of military assistance for Ukraine. This will supplement the package of &euro;500 million in military assistance that the EU has already provided under the European Peace Facility. Ireland&rsquo;s share of &euro;11million for that package will go towards non-lethal elements and we would expect to contribute a further &euro;11 million in a similar manner to this next package.</p>  <p>  The EU has already adopted the toughest and broadest sanctions measures ever seen, targeting key sectors of the Russian and Belarussian economies, as well as 685 individuals and 14 entities. There was  broad agreement at FAC on the need to maintain economic and political pressure through the adoption of a further sanctions package in the short term. There are a range of views across EU Member States as to what this further package should focus on &ndash; Ireland would favour restrictions on energy imports from Russia to the EU, specifically of coal, gas and oil, but we recognise that many EU countries will need time to undertake energy transition measures to reduce their dependency on Russian oil and gas in particular. Another key priority for all Member States is the rapid and effective implementation of the substantial packages of sanctions already agreed. Ireland has asked the Commission to prepare a rapid impact assessment of the sanctions adopted so far, so that we have evidence of what measures are working most effectively and where we may need to plug gaps.</p>  <p>  We also discussed and coordinated our actions to support those fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Moldova in particular have shown tremendous solidarity and generosity. I visited Warsaw last week and saw the Polish response first hand. The humanity and the effectiveness of this response is outstanding. It is clear that our response to the crisis will only be sustainable if we share the burden equitably. This was a point shared and understood by my colleagues. We agreed on the need to continue to strengthen our planning, coordination and burden-sharing structures.  </p>  <p>  The Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration joined the meeting to discuss how the EU can support his country in the midst of the current crisis. In addition to hosting considerable numbers of refugees, Moldova is facing particularly challenging security and political circumstances. The fragile situation in Moldova has been very much to the forefront of our national response and we have already committed to taking 500 Ukrainian refugees from Moldova and have provided over &euro;1 million in humanitarian aid directly to Moldova in the last three weeks. I informed the Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration of our response to date, and undertook to continue to support them in the coming months.  We agreed to hold a support conference in Berlin in early April to mobilise further concrete international support for Moldova, and to launch a Moldova Support Platform to prioritise and coordinate our support.</p>  <p>  EU Defence and Foreign Ministers also met jointly to approve the final text of the Strategic Compass. This important strategy document will provide clear political direction for the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) for the decade ahead. The Strategic Compass is not a common European defence policy; rather, it enables the EU to better anticipate threats, respond to crises and deepen our cooperation with partners.  It sets out series of concrete actions in areas such as crisis management, resilience. capability development and the EU&rsquo;s partnerships with key international actors, including the United Nations. </p>  <p>  The Strategic Compass text sets out the reality of the current European security environment in clear terms. The threats that face us have been made abundantly clear in recent weeks. Importantly, there is a strong focus on strengthening the EU&rsquo;s ability to respond to new and emerging challenges, particularly cyber-attacks and hybrid threats. In addition, the Strategic Compass also provides for the creation of a new Rapid Deployment Capacity, which will allow the EU to deploy up to 5,000 troops to respond quickly and more effectively to crises overseas.  Ireland has already been a consistent contributor to UN-authorised EU CSDP missions and operations.  Currently, some 28 Defence Forces personnel are deployed to military CSDP missions in Mali, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Libya, with 19 civilian experts also deployed to eight CSDP missions.  </p>  <p>  Ministers at FAC also had the opportunity to assess the EU&rsquo;s policy and response to events in Mali and Ethiopia. We considered and agreed how to tailor the EU&rsquo;s strategic engagement in the Sahel and how to best adapt our assistance, to ensure that we continue to deliver much needed humanitarian assistance and security for the population of Mali, while maintaining a focus on urging the transitional authorities to return to constitutional order.</p>  <p>  It is important that the conflict in Ukraine does not cause us to lose focus on other situations of conflict and this was emphasised in our discussions of the situation in Ethiopia. Despite some positive political developments there, we are still not seeing enough progress on the ground, especially in terms of the pressing issue of humanitarian access. This is particularly concerning in light of the expected consequences of the grain shortage we expect the war in Ukraine to bring later in this year. </p>  <p>  In advance of the Council meeting, we also held a discussion with the North Macedonian Foreign Minister. This focused on regional issues in the Western Balkans, the regional effects of the war in Ukraine, and North Macedonia&rsquo;s own EU accession process, of which we remain strongly supportive. </p></reply>

EU unity on successive sanctions packages sends an important message beyond the economic effects of the sanctions.</p>  <p>  From the beginning, it was understood that imposing sanctions on Russia would come at a cost to the EU. The impacts vary between Member States, but Russia's unconscionable actions leave us with little choice. Ireland has supported the widest possible sanctions to date, in order to put strong pressure on the Kremlin. </p>  <p>  The effects of EU sanctions on Russia have been significant. The Kremlin has begun setting out counter-measures, including designating all EU Member States as &ldquo;unfriendly countries&rdquo;. Discussions are underway at EU level on how to mitigate the impacts of any retaliatory measures on Member States.  </p>  <p>  So far, EU sanctions and Russian countermeasures have had a particularly heavy impact on the aircraft leasing sector in Ireland. Regrettably, the Russian Government has announced a number of measures that serve to undermine the efforts of Irish leasing companies to recover their aircraft following the termination of leases, as required by EU sanctions.  This includes certain actions in respect of aircraft registration that would be contrary to the provisions of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. Ireland has made contact with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to this end. My Department has also made a formal protest to the Russian authorities against these developments, recalling Russia&rsquo;s obligations under the Chicago Convention and as an ICAO member. Working closely with the Department of Transport, my Department is also assisting leasing companies with the recovery of aircraft from third countries, where possible.</p></reply>

Ireland has been actively engaged in efforts across the multilateral system to respond to Russian aggression, alleviate the humanitarian crisis and bring an end to this conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland joined with 38 other state parties in referring the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court, ICC, to investigate alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. By taking this action, the ICC prosecutor is now able to immediately begin a formal investigation.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s efforts at the UN, EU, International Criminal Court, the Council of Europe, the OSCE -and across all multilateral institutions - are aimed at bringing an end to this conflict, ensuring accountability for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and meeting the humanitarian needs of those caught in the conflict.</p>  <p>  As part of Ireland's support to Ukraine, we have also been in close contact with representatives of the Ukrainian government. On 3 March, I was pleased to meet with Ukraine's Ambassador to Ireland, H. E. Larysa Gerasko, and assure her of Ireland's solidarity with Ukraine. My officials are also in regular, near daily contact with her and her Embassy team. Ireland's Embassy to Ukraine continues to operate remotely and  to engage with the Ukrainian government including facilitating contact with relevant stakeholders in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have also been pleased to engage with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on numerous occasions in recent weeks as part of Foreign Affairs Council proceedings. I have expressed my admiration for the efforts of the Ukrainian government under pressure and re-iterated that Ireland's commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering.</p></reply>

Successive governments have exercised their executive power to maintain a consistent policy in this area.</p><p>A policy of neutrality is to be distinguished from the legal status of neutrality during an international armed conflict. The law on neutrality evolved in the 19<sup>th</sup>century but has been modified in important respects by developments in international law since that time, not least the legal prohibition in 1945 on the use of force, and the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security, as conferred on it by the UN Charter.  Our neutrality has never meant failing to distinguish between aggressors and the victims of aggression, and to do otherwise would be neglecting our commitment to international law.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s traditional policy of military neutrality has not been one of isolationism. It informs our active approach towards peace support operations and crisis management, our contributions to conflict resolution and peacebuilding, our work for human rights and development, and our efforts to promote disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. </p></reply>

This includes working towards secure legal pathways for Irish people to live and work in the US, as well as addressing the situation of the undocumented Irish.   </p>  <p>  Immigration matters are raised by senior members of the Government at every opportunity, and was a key issue raised during our St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day engagements across the US, not least at the bilateral exchange between the Taoiseach and President Biden last week. These high level engagements will continue as we maintain close relations with Members of Congress and contacts from across the political spectrum in the US, and as we seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations with President Biden's Administration.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to see that immigration issues, including possible pathways to citizenship, are a priority for President Biden, as demonstrated by his proposed US Citizenship Act of 2021. The Government is actively working with his Administration, as well as with the US Congress, on a bipartisan basis, as they pursue comprehensive immigration reform in the US.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Washington, D.C., as the representative office of the Government in the United States, pro-actively seeks out and creates opportunities to meet regularly with both Members of the House of Representatives and of the Senate across the political spectrum in the US. We are actively engaging with the Administration and Congress on finding innovative solutions and immigration pathways to address the challenges faced by the undocumented Irish in the US.  </p>  <p>  My Department, through Ireland's Embassy in Washington DC and our seven Consulate Generals across the US, also works closely with Irish immigration centres that provide support and information to our citizens, including the undocumented. Many of these groups, including the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres, receive significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme. </p>  <p>  In response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish communities abroad was also set up in 2020 to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable, including the undocumented Irish in the US.

Over 90% of that funding, including &euro;6,000,000 in two separate grants in 2021, has been channelled through the UN managed Yemen Humanitarian Fund (YHF). The YHF directly funds humanitarian partners operating in Yemen, enabling them to deliver timely and effective life-saving assistance to people who need it most.  In 2021 25 donors contributed $96 million to the YHF, which allocated over $109 million to 106 humanitarian projects implemented by 51 partners. Ireland was the sixth largest donor last year.</p>  <p>  On 16 March, at the High Level Pledging Event on Yemen, Minister Coveney pledged an additional &euro;5 million in Irish Aid funding to Yemen this year, also to the YHF. </p>  <p>  In addition, Irish Aid contributions to global funds and Irish Aid's substantial core funding to key agencies responding to the Yemen crisis, increases the total Irish response to humanitarian needs in Yemen.  Among these Irish Aid partners are WFP, UNICEF, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). CERF makes emergency funding readily available for UN agencies and is an important funding mechanism for the Yemen crisis.</p>  <p>  Augmenting Ireland's bilateral support is support through the European Union which since 2015 has contributed over &euro;1.2 billion to respond to the crisis in Yemen. This includes &euro;827 million in humanitarian aid and &euro;407 million in development assistance.  EU humanitarian aid includes food assistance, health care, education, water, and shelter. It also includes improved hygiene services in areas of high food insecurity and malnutrition, conflict-affected areas, and to displaced populations. So far this year &euro;135 million in humanitarian aid has been allocated by the EU for those affected by the conflict in Yemen.</p>  <p>  Conscious that the underlying drivers of conflict must be addressed if the humanitarian situation in Yemen is to change, at the UN Security Council Ireland has supported calls to end hostilities and continues to work with partners, including as a Member State of the EU, to support the work of Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General to end the conflict.</p></reply>

My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand throughout 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems. </p><p>In recent weeks, the Passport Service has reduced the average turnaround time for first time applications from 40 working days to 35 working days. In addition, 45% of adult online renewal applications are processed in one working day.</p><p>In terms of staffing, the Department has been working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive over the past several months. Since June 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service, with 156 staff joining since the beginning of 2022. The current number of staff at the Passport Service is 774. </p><p>In addition to this, and to complement staffing recruitment through the Public Appointments Service, the Passport Service is running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers with a view to assigning additional staff and to maintain staffing levels throughout the year to meet the demand expected in the coming months. This competition is currently underway and once completed, will see staffing numbers of over 900 at the Passport Service, which represents a doubling of staff numbers since last summer. </p><p>It is a priority for the Passport Service to improve processing times in 2022, particularly for first time applicants. The Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service:</p><p>- Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications, including first time applications.</p><p>- Actively prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to further reducing the current turnaround time.</p><p>- Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime with a focus on key areas including first time applications.</p><p>- A new document management system was put in place in early March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and turnaround times for applicants. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are prioritised and where applications are complete can now be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.</p><p>- A new Passport Service site in Swords, Co. Dublin opened in November 2021 and accommodates 140 staff. Works on expansion of the Passport Service site in Balbriggan began in January 2022 and it is anticipated that this will be completed in the autumn of 2022. This will accommodate 175 staff.</p><p>- Public information media campaigns reminding citizens to check and renew their passports will continue throughout this busy year.</p><p>- The Department of Foreign Affairs website has been enhanced and now includes a new passport service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application.</p><p>We are confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.</p><p>The current passport processing times are:</p><p>-10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p><p>-15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p><p>-35 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p><p>-8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p><p>There are currently over 182,000 applications in the Passport Service system. While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. These applications are all being processed in the usual way, with a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.</p><p>Figures show that of the total number of applications in the system, 63% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 37% of applications in the system are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.</p><p>First time passport applications do take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.</p><p>In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first time applications take 35 working days to process. </p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p></reply>

Their solidarity must now be matched by other EU Member States and Ireland will not be found wanting.  As of last weekend, over 9000 Ukrainians had come to Ireland, with a whole of Government response being put in place to assist their stay.  I would like to pay tribute to all those Irish people who have offered a place in their homes, or who are otherwise helping those Ukrainians who are here or coming here.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that Ireland must also assist those closer to Ukraine, already hosting millions of refugees.  That is why I allocated one quarter of the initial &euro;20 million Irish Aid Ukraine response package to the UNHCR Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP). The RRP is allocating its &euro;500 million appeal to directly supporting the host countries of Poland, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary. </p>  <p>  In addition, &euro;2 million of that support to UNHCR will go directly to is work in Poland and Moldova, who are coping with the largest influxes of refugees. </p>  <p>  Given the particular vulnerability of female refugees, &euro;1.5 million in Irish Aid support to UNFPA&rsquo;s work on protection of women and girls.</p>  <p>  A dedicated call for proposals for Irish NGOs ready to respond and support host countries is also being launched. </p>  <p>  &euro;1 million in Irish Aid funding is supporting national Red Cross societies, including in Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, and Romania, in their work with Ukrainian refugees.</p>  <p>  Ireland is contributing to the Regional Response Plan through Irish Aid core funding to key participating organisations, including UNICEF, IOM, UNDP, UNHCR, UNFPA, WFP, WHO and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). We encourage all our humanitarian partners to use their core funding to respond to the Ukraine humanitarian crisis including by supporting neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  Finally, the EU has also announced a rapid assistance package of &euro;500 million to help civilians affected by the conflict. This will include support to the RRP and additional funding to neighbouring countries.</p></reply>

In addition to ongoing bilateral contacts, I regularly discuss these matters with European partners in the context of multilateral fora, including the EU and the UN. I participate in meetings of the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) regarding the Middle East Peace Process, most recently on 18 October 2021. I addressed the UN Security Council on 16 May 2021 in response to the escalation in violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory. Ireland's representatives consistently engage in respect of our concerns at monthly Security Council meetings on the Middle East, most recently on 22 March.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Irish officials are in continuous dialogue with our European partners on these matters, including at the UN Security Council and via our Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels. </p></reply>

A new Embassy in Amman was opened in 2019. There are also Honorary Consuls in Manama, Alexandria, Beirut, Damascus, and Muscat.</p>  <p>  In June 2018, the Government launched the Global Ireland programme, which aims to double Ireland&rsquo;s global impact by 2025. To date, fourteen new Missions have opened. Four Missions opened in 2021, including Embassies in Kyiv, Manila, Rabat and a Consulate in Manchester. There have been Government decisions to open a further five new Missions. These are Consulates General in Toronto, Lyon and Miami and Embassies in Dakar and Tehran, which will bring to 19 the number of new Missions opened as part of the Global Ireland programme.</p>  <p>  All Missions are located in regions where there are opportunities for Ireland to advance our national, economic, and political priorities, including with regard to issues such as energy security.  Missions work as part of an integrated 'Team Ireland' model, in cooperation with State Agencies and other Government Departments, to strengthen Ireland's international reputation and promote our interests in trade, tourism, investment, science, technology and innovation, culture and education.</p>  <p>  In considering any further expansion of the Diplomatic network, a range of factors will be taken into account. The Government is conscious of the factors that might warrant the opening of new Missions in a number of countries and will keep the matter under active review.</p></reply>

Ukraine, in particular, has made impressive progress in aligning with EU standards and deserves recognition for their efforts to defend European values. </p>  <p>  However, we are mindful that there is a clear distinction between the response to the situation in Ukraine and applications from Moldova and Georgia. I also note that Ukraine FM Kuleba specifically asked at the 4 March FAC that the three countries not be treated as a package.</p>  <p>  On 10 March the European Council invited the Commission to submit its opinions on all three applications and to assess the applicant states' preparedness for accession. </p>  <p>  This will be based on a number of criteria, primarily the Republic of Moldova's capacity to align with the EU acquis. In the past, it has taken up to three years for the Commission to revert to the Council with their opinion. Typically, the opinion will set out a number of deliverables to be fulfilled by the country before it can be considered an official candidate country. Once the opinion is accepted by the Council, the country becomes a potential candidate country (similar to both Bosnia and Kosovo) entitling them to extra technical support and guidance under a stabilisation agreement with a view to boosting the country&rsquo;s preparedness for accession. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU aspirations of Moldova, while urging its authorities for continued improvements, particularly in the priority areas of promotion and protection of human rights, the rule of law, an independent judiciary and good governance. </p></reply>

Each time, Ireland has underlined the need for full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, as well as the necessity to protect human rights, especially those of Afghan women, girls, and minorities. Ireland strongly supported the UN Security Council Resolution, adopted on 22 December 2021, which exempts humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan from UN sanctions against members of the Taliban. </p>  <p>  Ireland will participate at a high level donor-pledging conference on Afghanistan on 31 March, at which donors will be asked to pledge their responses to a UN funding appeal for seeking approximately $5 billion to meet the emergency humanitarian needs within Afghanistan and of Afghan refugees in the region.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is also contributing to the EU response, which &ndash; along with Member States &ndash; allocated more than &euro;1 billion in funding last year to UN agencies and NGOs working in Afghanistan to deliver humanitarian aid and to support basic needs. The EU has also established a humanitarian air bridge that has delivered over 280 tonnes of lifesaving medication, food and equipment against COVID-19 to Afghanistan.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland contributes to support global funds and provides core funding to key agencies that allocate funding to Afghanistan, including the EU, WHO, UNHCR, IFRC, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland was the 9th largest donor to the CERF in 2021, providing &euro;11 million. Since August 2021, the CERF has allocated more than &euro;68.6 million to Afghanistan. </p></reply>

I note the publication of the detailed and comprehensive report issued on 1 February. The content of the report is under review by officials in my Department, and they have had an initial meeting with Amnesty International on the report and its recommendations.</p>  <p>  There have not been discussions at EU level of this report to date. However, Ireland has been consistently forthright in expressing concern regarding the unequal treatment of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, including at EU level. Ireland works closely with our EU partners on the issue and my officials remain in close contact with EU member states, the European Commission and the European External Action Service. Ireland will continue to raise our concerns on a regular basis directly with the Israeli authorities, including during visits to the region, as well as at EU and UN fora. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also been proactive in regularly highlighting our concerns on this issue, including demolitions and settlement expansion, at the UN Security Council during our term. Ireland has maintained a consistent approach at monthly meetings on the situation in the Middle East and has raised particular issues of concern, including the designation of six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organisations and housing plans by Israel in East Jerusalem. At the Council meeting on 22 March, Ireland reiterated the longstanding EU position that Israel must end settlement expansion, confiscations, demolitions and evictions. Ireland has been clear that these actions are underlying causes of tension and violence.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of sanctions, Ireland does not have any unilateral sanctions regimes, but implements EU sanctions, adopted as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and UN sanctions. There are currently no EU or UN sanctions in place against Israel and there is not a consensus either at the level of the EU, or the UN Security Council, on the introduction of sanctions against Israel.</p></reply>

Ireland has been fully engaged at each of the 13 times when the Security Council discussed Ukraine to date in 2022. We have actively supported Security Council and General Assembly meetings on Ukraine, and have urged others to join us in condemning Russia&rsquo;s illegal, unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine and to call on Russia to immediately withdraw its forces from the entire territory of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Ireland actively supported efforts to bring a resolution condemning the invasion to the Security Council. Although Russia vetoed this resolution, this did not stop Ireland and the international community in holding Russia to account, and we joined like-minded partners in calling for an Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly to discuss the crisis, only the 11th time in UN history that this has happened. </p>  <p>  Ireland co-sponsored a strong UN General Assembly resolution, condemning Russia&rsquo;s aggression and calling for their immediate withdrawal, which was adopted with the support of the overwhelming majority of UN Member States on 2 March. This marked a powerful global rejection of Russia&rsquo;s aggression against a sovereign state. </p>  <p>  Ireland has called for the safe passage and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance, including medical and food supplies, to those in need and has stressed the importance of safeguarding women and children during conflict. We have called on Russia to uphold its obligations under international law and to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops from within the internationally recognised borders of Ukraine. Ireland is continuing to work with our partners at the Security Council and General Assembly to support genuine efforts to ensure humanitarian access. </p>  <p>  Prior to Russia's further invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Ireland had repeatedly reaffirmed its support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine at United Nations Security Council meetings on Ukraine this year and last year, including at Arria formula meetings.   </p></reply>

The Government has engaged consistently with the British Government to underline the importance of progress on the implementation of this framework.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in July 2021, the UK Government published a Command Paper which proposed a Statute of Limitations. I have made clear to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that this is not a proposal that the Irish Government could support, and the Taoiseach has also underlined this message to Prime Minister Johnson. We have also cautioned strongly against unilateral action in this most sensitive space.</p>  <p>  As agreed at the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) in June 2021, the Government joined the British Government and the Northern Irish parties in a process of intensive engagement of these issues, which began in July 2021. Throughout this process, there was a clear message from victims groups that a statute of limitations could not be the way forward. It has also been strongly and publicly opposed by all the parties. </p>  <p>  The issue was discussed once again at the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference that took place in Farmleigh House yesterday. I reiterated to the Secretary of State that, while we continue to remain ready to engage with concerns or issues to do with the implementation of the Stormont House agreement, any such changes must be discussed and agreed by the parties and both Governments, as part of a collective process.  </p>  <p>  I will continue to take every opportunity in the period immediately ahead to engage with the British Government at all levels on this issue, and to underline the importance of finding a collective way forward now. It is essential that any legacy framework meet the legitimate needs of victims and uphold our shared human rights obligations, for those families who have waited for too long for truth and justice for their loved ones.</p></reply>

I welcome the meeting of the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee on 21 February, and the meeting of the Specialised Committee on the implementation of the Protocol held on 8 March. I note the determination expressed in the resulting joint statements to ensure that durable solutions are found as soon as possible for the benefit of people and businesses in Northern Ireland. The EU and the UK have committed to continuing their talks and to further engagement with business groups, civil society, and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  While we would like to have seen more progress by now, it is important that we continue to focus on the issues of genuine and practical concern to people in Northern Ireland. The EU&rsquo;s proposals published last October directly address concerns around SPS and customs movements, medicines and giving greater voice to Northern Irish stakeholders in the implementation of the Protocol. The EU has demonstrated further flexibility by putting forward a proposal to change its own legislation to guarantee the long-term supply of medicines to Northern Ireland. This flexibility now needs to be reciprocated by the British Government.    </p>  <p>  People in Northern Ireland want the Protocol to work. They recognise that the Protocol presents Northern Ireland with unique economic opportunities. Most people see the Protocol as a good thing on balance for Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  I continue to engage regularly with stakeholders in Northern Ireland, including political leaders, the business community, and civic society &ndash; as does the European Commission. I remain in regular contact with Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic and with our partners across the EU. Support for the European Commission&rsquo;s approach remains steadfast across the Union. I also have regular engagement with both the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the UK Foreign Secretary. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach recently met with Prime Minister Johnson in London, where he highlighted the importance of reaching agreement on durable, practical solutions. During his bilateral engagements in Washington D.C., the Taoiseach&rsquo;s discussions also covered developments in Northern Ireland, British-Irish and EU-UK relations, and the implementation of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol. </p>  <p>  In all engagements, we continue to emphasise the need to find an agreed approach to the implementation of the Protocol as soon as possible for the benefit of people and businesses in Northern Ireland. We urge the British Government to engage constructively with the EU. Agreeing an approach on the Protocol would be an important factor in opening up a new chapter of more positive EU-UK cooperation. We have seen in recent weeks the strength of the EU and UK working together to support Ukraine in the face of Russia&rsquo;s abhorrent and illegal aggression. I hope that spirit of partnership can extend to the talks on the implementation of the Protocol. </p></reply>

Our participation in the European Peace Facility (EPF), an off-budget instrument established by the EU in March 2021 and aimed at funding EU Common Security and Defence Policy actions, is part of that commitment.  </p>  <p>  The EPF is one element of a broad set of EU foreign policy instruments, which support sustainable development, humanitarian action, conflict prevention and peacebuilding. The EPF is used in particular to fund the military and defence aspects of partnerships with regional organisations and third countries, while other instruments fund the peacebuilding, conflict prevention, mediation, security sector reform and wider development aspects.</p>  <p>  In certain circumstances and subject to strong safeguards, funding from the EPF may also be used to provide equipment designed to deliver lethal force. During the negotiations to establish the Facility, Ireland, together with a number of like-minded States, ensured the inclusion of a provision allowing Member States to constructively abstain from measures involving lethal equipment. This removes from the Member States concerned any obligation to pay for the lethal equipment component of an assistance measure.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the EU adopted seven EPF measures to provide non-lethal assistance in support of Georgia (&euro;12.75 million), Moldova (&euro;7 million), Ukraine (&euro;31 million), Mali (&euro;24 million), Bosnia and Herzegovina (&euro;10 million), Mozambique (&euro;40 million), and the African Union (&euro;130 million).</p>  <p>  On 28 February 2022, the EU went on to agree an EPF package of &euro;500 million in military assistance for Ukraine.  For the first time ever, this consisted of a &euro;450 million allocation for lethal equipment, as well as an additional &euro;50 million in funding for non-lethal equipment. On 21 March, EU Foreign Ministers reached political agreement on a further &euro;500 million package of EPF assistance for Ukraine, based on an identical breakdown in terms of resources to the funding package agreed on 28 February. </p>  <p>  In respect of both packages, and in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government,  Ireland will not contribute to the funding of lethal equipment and our support will only go to non-lethal elements.   In financial terms, our total contribution is likely to amount to approximately &euro;22 million.  In addition to the allocation of financial resources, this also includes the provision by Ireland of some 10 tonnes of ready-to-eat meals and 200 units of body armour directly to the Ukrainian military. These supplies have already been dispatched in recent days.  </p>  <p>  Separately, Ireland has been responding to the humanitarian emergency in and around Ukraine. Ireland has committed &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid to the situation in Ukraine and in neighbouring Moldova. </p>  <p>  In the period ahead, Ireland will continue to work with the European Union, United Nations, and other partners to assess the best means by which we can continue to provide both political and practical support to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.</p></reply>

Their solidarity must now be matched by other EU Member States and Ireland will not be found wanting.  As of last weekend, over 9000 Ukrainians had come to Ireland, with a whole of Government response being put in place to assist their stay.  I would like to pay tribute to all those Irish people who have offered a place in their homes, or who are otherwise helping those Ukrainians who are here or coming here.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that Ireland must also assist those closer to Ukraine, already hosting millions of refugees.  That is why I allocated one quarter of the initial &euro;20 million Irish Aid Ukraine response package to the UNHCR Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRP). The RRP is allocating its &euro;500 million appeal to directly supporting the host countries of Poland, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary. </p>  <p>  In addition, &euro;2 million of that support to UNHCR will go directly to is work in Poland and Moldova, who are coping with the largest influxes of refugees. </p>  <p>  Given the particular vulnerability of female refugees, &euro;1.5 million in Irish Aid support to UNFPA&rsquo;s work on protection of women and girls.</p>  <p>  A dedicated call for proposals for Irish NGOs ready to respond and support host countries is also being launched. </p>  <p>  &euro;1 million in Irish Aid funding is supporting national Red Cross societies, including in Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, and Romania, in their work with Ukrainian refugees.</p>  <p>  Ireland is contributing to the Regional Response Plan through Irish Aid core funding to key participating organisations, including UNICEF, IOM, UNDP, UNHCR, UNFPA, WFP, WHO and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). We encourage all our humanitarian partners to use their core funding to respond to the Ukraine humanitarian crisis including by supporting neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  Finally, the EU has also announced a rapid assistance package of &euro;500 million to help civilians affected by the conflict. This will include support to the RRP and additional funding to neighbouring countries.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-24a.318.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032400053#WRJ00900"><p>It is important to note firstly that it is a matter for the European Commission to decide to financially sanction Member States via the measures provided for in the Regulation on a General Regime of Conditionality for the Protection of the Union Budget. No decision has been taken to financially sanction a Member State pursuant to the Conditionality Regulation.</p>  <p>  On 10 March 2022, the European Parliament adopted a resolution welcoming the recent upholding by the Court of Justice of the European Union of the legality of this budget conditionality regulation.  The Parliament&rsquo;s resolution also called on the European Commission to respond urgently to ongoing and severe violations of the Rule of Law through application of the budget conditionality mechanism.</p>  <p>  Ireland also welcomed the Court of Justice decision confirming the legality of the budget conditionality regulation. Our position has consistently been that the mechanism is fair and proportionate. We also welcome the Commission&rsquo;s recent publication of guidelines clarifying how a prospective application of the mechanism would operate in practice.</p>  <p>  Amid this illegal and appalling conflict in Ukraine, it is more important than ever that the EU is united and internally strong. I saw first-hand last week in Poland the enormous consequences that Russia's aggression in Ukraine has had, and will continue to have, for frontline EU Member States such as Poland. Similar is true for Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and others. We stand in solidarity with these countries during this tremendously challenging time and I underlined this message of solidarity during my meeting with Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau last Friday.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, respect by all EU Member States for the foundational values of the Union, including rule of law, is an integral part of the EU&rsquo;s strength, including in the face of external threats. Challenges with respect to rule of law standards in Poland and Hungary do continue to present cause for concern. Ireland supports the Commission in exercising its role as guardian of the treaties and ensuring Member States adhere to the EU&rsquo;s values. We note that the Commission wrote to Poland and Hungary in late 2021 in the context of budget conditionality regulation setting out specific concerns regarding domestic rule of law challenges.</p>  <p>  We continue to urge both Member States to engage constructively with the Commission and hope that there will be positive movement to address these concerns and that activation of the regulation will not prove necessary. Should the Commission opt to apply the mechanism however, Ireland will engage fully in any Council discussions.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s support for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders is unwavering. Since Russia&rsquo;s further large-scale invasion of Ukraine, Ireland has stated clearly that this is a blatant violation of the UN Charter and a breach of international law for which Russia must be held solely accountable. Ireland has also engaged intensively at EU level in support of Ukraine, including on the largest package of sanctions in EU history on Russia. Ireland will also contribute to the European Peace Facility&rsquo;s support of Ukraine through providing non-lethal support.  </p>  <p>  Ireland joined with 38 other state parties in referring the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court, ICC, to investigate alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Ireland has also acted decisively at the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly in support of Ukraine. 141 UN member states voted in favour of a resolution, which we co-sponsored, deploring Russia&rsquo;s aggression.</p>  <p>  My Department, through the Irish Aid programme, has put in place a &euro;20 million humanitarian response fund, which is being delivered through Irish Aid partners present in Ukraine and ready to immediately provide support to Ukrainians affected by the conflict.  Among those partners are the Red Cross Movement and UN agencies, including UN OCHA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO.  In addition, a dedicated call for proposals for Irish NGOs ready to respond is also being launched.</p>  <p>  Guiding the Irish Aid response is the need to get resources to those affected as quickly as possible.  By supporting trusted partners active on the ground with cash, Irish Aid is enabling them to deliver without delay while protecting valuable supplies channels from being overloaded.  This initial Irish Aid humanitarian package puts emphasis on support to refugees, including the protection of women and girls as well as education, on healthcare and on humanitarian response including establishing much needed humanitarian corridors.  Ireland is also part of the EU humanitarian response, which since February has disbursed over &euro;93 million in humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Working with the HSE, and in response to a request from the Ukrainian government through the coordinated EU Civil Protection Mechanism, my officials have supported the dispatch of medical supplies to Ukraine.</p></reply>

We are looking at every available avenue open to us and reviewing the impact of our actions to date.  A new EU sanctions package was adopted last week, introducing further restrictions on Russian financial services and the defence and security sector, plus a ban on imports of iron and steel products and exports of luxury goods.  We will continue to work with EU partners to agree further sanctions and robust restrictive measures.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a party to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 (VCDR), which has the force of law in the State pursuant to the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967.  The Vienna Convention recognises the necessity of privileges and immunities for the peaceful and efficient conduct of international relations. The VCDR provides for a number of remedies which are available to a receiving state, including in the event that the actions of a member of the diplomatic staff of the mission, or any other member of the staff of the mission, are not acceptable. This continues to be kept under review.</p>  <p>  There is value in keeping diplomatic channels open with Russia, not least to protect our interests and our citizens. Like all of the other responses we have deployed, we will continue to coordinate closely with EU partners to ensure decisions have a meaningful impact.</p></reply>

From 14 local projects supported in 2013, the programme has grown greatly and this year will support over 100 different projects right across the world. The funding my Department makes available from the Government's Emigrant Support Programme has grown in response to that demand, from &euro;45,000 in 2013 to &euro;200,000 this year. </p>  <p>  The strength and resilience of the programme was amply demonstrated in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, when our international GAA partner clubs and networks along with our Irish Community Welfare Support Organizations became the backbone for the delivery of assistance and support to our emigrants, including through the Government&rsquo;s dedicated Covid Response Fund. I would like to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to those efforts, much of which was done in a voluntary capacity. </p>  <p>  10 years on from its launch, my Department and the GAA sat down to review the operation and objectives of the Programme, in particular, how to build on the experience gained during the pandemic. </p>  <p>  I was very pleased to be able to announce the outcome of our renewed partnership with the President of the GAA in Croke Park on Tuesday 8 March.  We agreed to re-focus our support on grass root activity; to concentrate assistance on the small, local community clubs; to increase the focus on youth involvement; as well as sponsoring the regional tournaments that have become a show-case for the games at international level. We will continue to expand the programme to reflect the changing patterns of Irish emigration, such as in Asia, Canada and the Middle East.  On the administration side, we agreed to build-up the support of Croke Park&rsquo;s central management on delivery and to strengthen our financial control procedures in line with the growth of the programme. </p>  <p>  Some of the projects being funded are one-off events, others have elements lasting the course of a year, and each are identified through an Open Call mechanism conducted by GAA HQ.  The applications are screened at a regional level by the GAA and funding decisions are taken jointly by a team from GAA HQ and officials of my Department.  </p>  <p>  As our communities abroad emerge from the shadow of Covid, the Government stands ready through a strengthened Global Games Development Fund, and sister programmes within the Emigrant Support Programme, to help them restore their community infrastructure, activities and networks.  I was heartened to see for myself, and to hear from colleagues who participated in this year&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations, the degree to which our communities abroad have been able to recover from the challenges they have had to overcome during the past two difficult years.</p></reply>

I am deeply troubled by the evictions and demolitions carried out by the Israeli authorities in the neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah on 17-18 January. The recent ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court in favour of four Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah is a welcome development, but residents of Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan remain threatened with eviction from their homes.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s position on these matters is based on international law including international human rights law, Israel&rsquo;s obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as the occupying power in the occupied Palestinian territory, and on the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been proactive in ensuring that these issues are highlighted at the UN Security Council. At the Council meeting on 19 January, the day following the incident in Sheikh Jarrah, Ireland made clear that demolitions and evictions undermine the prospects for peace and risk increasing violence, and called on Israel to cease these unilateral actions and comply with its obligations as an occupying power under international humanitarian law. Ireland also issued a joint press statement following the Security Council meeting, along with France and Estonia. Ireland also raised East Jerusalem at this week&rsquo;s Council meeting on 22 March.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Representative was present in Sheikh Jarrah on 17 January along with other EU diplomats to monitor the incident, and the Ambassador in Tel Aviv has communicated our concerns directly to the Israeli authorities.</p>  <p>  Ireland provides humanitarian assistance, legal and other supports to specific development projects to improve the situation of Palestinians. We fund a number of civil society partners that are active on human rights issues, which impact specifically on Palestinians in East Jerusalem, including in relation to evictions.</p></reply>

The policy means Ireland does not participate in military alliances or mutual defence arrangements.  </p>  <p>  However, while militarily neutral, we have always been politically active and we have continued to participate constructively at EU level in the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), guided by our policy of military neutrality and our contribution to crisis management and peacekeeping.  </p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, Ireland has been a very active participant in both civilian and military CSDP missions and operations. At present, 28 members of the Defence Forces are serving in three UN-mandated EU military missions and operations, while 19 civilian experts are currently serving in EU CSDP civilian missions.</p>  <p>  Over recent months, EU Member States have also been discussing the Strategic Compass, an exercise intended to provide enhanced political and strategic direction for the EU&rsquo;s CSDP for the decade ahead. I joined my fellow EU foreign and defence ministers in agreeing this strategy document at our meeting in Brussels on 21 March.</p>  <p>  The document sets out the current European security environment in clear terms, including Russia&rsquo;s appalling military aggression against Ukraine.  In addition to this analysis, the Strategic Compass also proposes a series of actions for the EU to take in areas such as crisis management, resilience, capability development and partnerships.  </p>  <p>  From the Government&rsquo;s perspective, the document displays an important unity of purpose not only in terms of the EU&rsquo;s response to threats, but also as regards the projection of the EU&rsquo;s values and support for the rules-based international order.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that within the EU, security and defence policy clearly remains a national competence. The Strategic Compass, and Ireland&rsquo;s continued active participation in the EU&rsquo;s CSDP, will therefore in no way prejudice the security and defence policy of Ireland or any other Member State.   </p></reply>

Over the course of the two-day visit, I met with senior UN officials, foreign policy organisations, and representatives from the local Irish American community.</p>  <p>  On 8th March, International Women's Day, I participated in a UN Security Council open debate on the theme of Women, Peace and Security. Ireland has made Women, Peace and Security a priority of our Security Council membership.  We co-chair, with Mexico, the Informal Working Group on Women, Peace and Security and we formed, together with Kenya and Mexico, a WPS Presidency Trio which committed to making the WPS Agenda a central focus. </p>  <p>  I also, in my intervention, condemned the Russian Federation in the strongest terms for its decision to launch an unprovoked, unjustified and illegal attack, violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and creating a terrible catastrophe in Europe. I then took the opportunity to highlight the grim reality currently facing women and girls in Ukraine and Afghanistan in particular and I stressed the responsibility of the international community to uphold the rights of all women at risk due to conflict.  </p>  <p>  I met with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, who was complimentary about Ireland's active and effective role on the Security Council, and he thanked me for the constant cooperation and support across a range of initiatives including WPS, Human Rights issues, and the Sustainable Development Goals.  Our discussion was focussed on Ukraine and the need for an immediate ceasefire to prevent further humanitarian catastrophe.  The Secretary General noted that Russia&rsquo;s actions have violated the UN Charter and International Law.  We agreed that the scale of the humanitarian and refugee crisis was at a level not seen in Europe for many years and also noted the effect that the war will have on global food and energy supplies.   </p>  <p>  While at the UN, I also met with the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Abdulla Shahid.  In our brief discussion, I thanked the President for his role in convening the Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly which adopted, by an overwhelming majority of 141 in favour to just 5 against, resolution A/ES-11/L.1 demanding that the Russian Federation immediately end its invasion of Ukraine and unconditionally withdraw all its military forces.  We also discussed other efforts to end the crisis.  Lastly, we touched upon Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to Climate action and to other priority areas of the UNGA agenda.  </p>  <p>  While in New York, I also undertook a number of engagements with influential foreign policy organisations. I addressed the Council on Foreign Relations on Europe&rsquo;s response to the invasion of Ukraine. I outlined the position taken by Ireland, underlining the need for strong international cooperation in support of the international rules based order, now more than ever. </p>  <p>  There is a keen interest in the United States on the implications Brexit will have for the island of Ireland, North and South. My visit included an exchange with the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, which was mainly focused on Brexit developments and the importance of stabilising the Northern Ireland Protocol. I also participated in a roundtable discussion with representatives of Irish America on the Good Friday Agreement, reconciliation and legacy issues.</p>  <p>  In addition to political meetings, I had the chance to meet with members of the Ireland Funds and to reiterate the strength and importance of our relationship with the US, underpinned by longstanding  diaspora and business links, which will be key as both countries look towards recovery following the global pandemic.</p>  <p>  This visit to New York came at an important time for Ireland, the United States, and the larger international community, and reinforced the commitment this Government has to the maintenance of international peace and security.</p></reply>

Situated in the context of the unfolding crisis in Ukraine, the latter are likely to focus on the central importance of the European Court for Human Rights; participatory democracy, with a focus on youth engagement; and the protection of the rights of minorities and vulnerable groups.   </p>  <p>  I intend to travel to Strasbourg a number of times over the six-month term, including to engage with the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, while our Permanent Representation to the Council of Europe, led by Ambassador Breifne O'Reilly, will host a series of events to showcase and celebrate the diversity of contemporary Irish culture.</p>  <p>  Notably, in September, the Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee, will host a Ministerial conference in Dublin on the subject of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, with Justice Ministers from all 46 Member States coming together to spur efforts across the continent to substantively tackle violence against women and girls. </p>  <p>  Working with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Finance, and others, my Department is also organizing conferences in Dublin, Cork, and Galway to advance other critical areas of the Council of Europe's work, including children's rights and democratic participation. </p>  <p>  The Committee of Ministers' decision last week, supported by Ireland, to exclude the Russian Federation is unprecedented in the 73-year history of the Council of Europe, and reflects the strongest possible condemnation of the Russian Federation's unjustified and unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, another Council of Europe member. </p>  <p>  I regret that, through these actions, the Russian authorities have deprived the Russian people of the benefit of the world&rsquo;s most advanced human rights protection system. But regrettable as it is, the exclusion is necessary, given the Russian Federation&rsquo;s disavowal of the values, principles, and legal obligations which membership of the Council of Europe entails.</p>  <p>  As a founder member, Ireland will champion those same values and principles through our Presidency term, reaffirming the Council of Europe's central role in the protection of human rights across the continent when it is needed most. </p></reply>

Passport Service statistics show that approximately 33% of first time child applications are incomplete.  A significant proportion of those incomplete applications occur when parents have not submitted any documentation to the Passport Service. In these cases, parents apply online for their child&rsquo;s passport and can take weeks or sometimes even months to submit the required supporting documents such as the witnessed consent form and child&rsquo;s identity documents such as their birth certificate. The Passport Service is unable to process these applications until the required supporting documentation is submitted.   </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is continuously looking at ways to make the application process easier for child applicants and advises during the online application process to make sure that the consent form is correctly witnessed once they have completed the online process.  It is not the experience of the Passport Service that incorrect dates on the Child Identity and Consent form is a widespread issue.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service provides instructions on how to correctly complete these forms on the Department's website (www.dfa.ie/passports/how-to-get-your-application-witnessed/).</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These materials will include information on correctly completing the Child Identity and Consent form. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Passport Service maintains a close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and regularly offers training and guidance to Garda&iacute; on the correct completion of the required identity and consent forms.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has recently implemented a new document management system that will help reduce processing time for applications that are incomplete when initially submitted. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are prioritised and where applications are complete can now be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.</p>  <p>  I am confident that these measures will help to reduce errors on applications and will improve customer experience. </p></reply>

At COP26 in 2021, the Taoiseach announced that Ireland will more than double its international climate finance, reaching at least &euro;225 million per year by 2025. The target represents a significant increase on current levels of climate finance, which totalled &euro;93.6 million in 2019. Reaching the new target will assist in making significant progress towards the Programme for Government commitment to &ldquo;at a minimum, double the overall percentage of our development assistance that counts as climate finance&rdquo; by 2030. </p>  <p>  Work on the Strategy is led by the Department of Foreign Affairs, working closely with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Department of Finance, and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and the Marine, along with other Government Departments. Consultation has also taken place with civil society. Work on the Strategy is well advanced, with a view to finalisation by Summer 2022. </p>  <p>  The Strategy aims to provide a pathway to deliver on our targets, whilst ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s climate finance is effective and impactful in supporting developing countries to address climate change. </p>  <p>  Following the commitment in the Programme for Government, a Climate Unit was established in the Department of Foreign Affairs in October 2020. This Unit is embedded in the Development Cooperation and Africa Division in the Department. There are currently nine officers working in the Unit. </p>  <p>  The Climate Unit has built upon the climate work that was previously taking place across the Department, in particular the funding of climate action through the Irish Aid programme, and is significantly scaling up this work. More broadly, a key role of the Unit is to strengthen capacity across the Department, including at Embassy-level, for effective climate diplomacy and provision of climate finance. The Unit currently has three main areas of thematic focus. These are Adaptation and Resilience, including Loss and Damage; Climate and Security; and Oceans. </p></reply>

The Government respects everyone&rsquo;s right on this island to make the case for the constitutional future they wish to see for Northern Ireland - whether the continuation of the union with Great Britain or a sovereign united Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement - and the two sovereign Governments - explicitly recognise and validate the legitimacy of both of these constitutional positions, which are deeply held.</p>  <p>  The holding of a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland. The decision to hold such a poll in Northern Ireland rests with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Agreement provides that the Secretary of State shall call a poll: &ldquo;if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The principle of consent and the possibility of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland are fundamental elements of the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people of the island of Ireland, North and South. Should there be a vote in favour of constitutional change in the future, it will be a binding obligation on both Governments to introduce and support in their respective Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish.  </p>  <p>  The full implementation and effective operation of the Good Friday Agreement is a priority for this Government. The Government&rsquo;s focus now, and our commitment through the Shared Island initiative, is on working with all communities and political traditions, to take up the significant opportunities of deeper cooperation and connection on the island, and to build consensus on key issues for our shared future, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

This is also the case for citizens of the European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), and Switzerland.</p>  <p>  The employment permits system in Ireland  is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages, in circumstances where there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. The system is managed through the use of lists designating highly skilled and ineligible occupations.</p>  <p>  Since March 2020, the Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment.  Indeed, Ireland was one of the few countries which managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect.</p>  <p>  The Department has experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.</p>  <p>  My Department issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.  The impact of this has resulted in a significant backlog, which has increased from 1,000 in April 2021 to approximately c. 10,500 at the end of January 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits, following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists, that I announced at the end of October has increased applications for employment permits for these roles. Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack, when employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other non-standard methods. </p>  <p>  I and my Department recognises the impact of current delays on the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and have developed a plan of action to bring down the processing backlog built up over the pandemic.  The plan includes both additional staffing and systemic changes.  Staffing actions include recruitment of additional permanent and temporary staff.  In late November 2021 approval was granted to increase our permanent processing capacity by 69% and to increase overall capacity to 125% when temporary staff are included.  On 2 February 2022 further additional approval was granted to increase permanent processing capacity by 125% and increase overall capacity by 225% from the original early base in early November. </p>  <p>  When all recruitment is completed, the team will be three and a quarter times the size it was in early November.  There has also been an increase in overtime and the temporary reassignment of staff from other areas of the Department with relevant skills.</p>  <p>  These measures have already delivered a considerable increase in processing capacity.  As the plan of action is fully implemented it is expected that there will be positive progress achieved in reducing the backlog by the end of Q1 with it substantially reduced by the end of Q2 2022.  This should see a return to more normal processing timeframes.</p>  <p>  In addition, further systemic changes have also been introduced.  The Department has worked with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and the Department of Justice to streamline and extend the time period for General Employment Permits (GEP) issued to doctors.  A new two-year multi-site GEP for Medical Doctors in Public hospitals and Public health facilities was introduced in respect of the January 2022 Doctors rotation.  This will result in significant benefits for applicants, as well as major efficiencies for the Employment Permits Section, by eliminating the necessity to apply for additional employment permits when moving to a different Public hospital or Public health facility within this two year period.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department provides regular updates on its website in relation to processing times and engages directly with key stakeholders including the IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, AmCham, IBEC, representative groups and individual companies.</p></reply>

Following this process and assisted by the Civil Law and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act &ndash; which removed the requirement for consent to such a mode of hearing, the WRC established a remote hearing platform and almost all hearings that have taken place over the past two years have been carried out via that platform. </p>  <p>  In that time, on average, the WRC has been offering between 120-135 hearings per week: more than that available pre-Covid. As Covid restrictions ease the WRC will also will be in a position to bring forward for early disposal those cases that are not suited to a virtual hearing. </p>  <p>  Given this disruption, the median time for decisions issued in Quarter 4 2021 stood at 15 months from date complaint received and this includes complaints received both before and during the initial phase of Covid-19 where cases could not be brought to hearing until the virtual hearing platform went &ldquo;live&rdquo; and was fully utilised by parties. </p>  <p>  Over the next 8 months, the WRC is in a position to dispose of or schedule for hearing all cases received prior to 2022 where parties are available to attend and no delays in submissions arise from one or other party. This will impact positively on the overall median period, and I am further informed that the WRC is in a position to offer complaints currently being received a hearing date or dispose of such cases within ten months. Decisions typically issue within a month of the hearing.</p></reply>

The Act defines the term 'construction contract' for the purposes of the legislation and some contracts are exempt from the legislation including if the value of the contract is not more than &euro;10,000.</p>  <p>  The Act provides, inter alia, important statutory protections for subcontractors in the construction industry. It imposes minimum contractual provisions in relation to payments, particularly the timing of payments and the parties to a relevant construction contract cannot opt out of the provisions of the legislation. </p>  <p>  The Act applies to construction operations where the following items are supplied under a construction contract, as defined in the Act, and which also provides for their installation: </p>  <p>  (i) building or engineering components or equipment; or </p>  <p>  (ii) materials, plant or machinery; or </p>  <p>  (iii) components for systems of heating, lighting, air-conditioning, ventilation, power supply, drainage, sanitation, water supply or fire protection, or for security or communications systems.</p>  <p>  The Act provides a statutory right for a party to a relevant construction contract to refer a payment dispute arising under the contract for adjudication. When this right is exercised, the parties to the contract may jointly agree to appoint an Adjudicator of their own choice to the dispute. If the parties cannot or do not agree as to whom to appoint, a party may apply to the Chairperson of the Construction Contracts Adjudication Panel under section 6(4) of the Act to appoint an Adjudicator to the dispute from the Ministerial appointed Panel of Adjudicators.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where a company is in Receivership and a subcontractor wishes to pursue a case under the Construction Contracts Act, 2013, the subcontractor may wish to take appropriate legal or other advice in relation to such a claim, which should take account of the contract that the parties have entered into.</p>  <p>  Comprehensive information on the Act is available on the website of my Department at enterprise.gov.ie/en/Publications/Information-Booklet-Construction-Contracts-Act-2013.html.</p></reply>

The proposal is targeted and pragmatic and aims at ensuring that governments can resort to compulsory licences, including to export to countries with no or limited manufacturing capacities, in the most effective manner adapted to the circumstances of a pandemic. </p>  <p>  The EU is of the view that there is no single solution and that a multi-pronged approach is needed and that discussions should concentrate on how the Intellectual Property system can contribute towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and the equitable access to vaccines around the world.</p>  <p>  In recent months, the EU has participated in the informal discussions on the intellectual property element of the WTO response to the COVID-19 pandemic with representatives of South Africa, India and the US, facilitated by the WTO DG.</p>  <p>  As a result of these negotiations, a potential draft decision on a proposed solution to the TRIPS waiver was put forward by the WTO Secretariat last week, initially by the group known as the &ldquo;Quad&rdquo;, which comprises the EU, the US, India, and South Africa. </p>  <p>  Once this potential proposal is presented to the full WTO membership for consideration I will be in a position to report on the relevant details.</p>  <p>  What I can say is that the EU has shown flexibility to finding a solution, by clarifying and waiving certain obligations in the TRIPS Agreement which would allow WTO Members&rsquo; governments to authorise a company to manufacture and export COVID-19 pharmaceutical products in a fast and simplified manner.  </p>  <p>  This solution would facilitate production of vaccines, especially in regions such as Africa, while preserving incentives for innovation and investment.</p>  <p>  Europe has committed 200 million doses to reach low and middle-income countries by the end of this year, mainly through the COVAX initiative and is investing &euro;1 billion to ramp up mRNA production capacity in Africa.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government has to date committed to the donation of &euro;13.5 million and five million COVID-19 vaccine doses to the COVAX facility. Over 1.8 million doses have already been delivered to recipient countries including almost 1.5 million doses delivered to African countries including Uganda, Nigeria, Indonesia, Ghana and Burkina Faso. </p>  <p>  The WHO recently stated that it sees a very positive outlook for supply of vaccines for 2022, that this is predicated on the continuation of dose sharing and manufacturers honouring deals brokered under COVAX, and that unequal distribution, rather than supply, could compromise global access to vaccines.</p></reply>

Air services agreements set out, among other things, the arrangements for exchange of air traffic rights.  </p>  <p>  Included in these agreements is the reciprocal exchange of traffic rights i.e. the scheduled air services that are permitted to be flown by the air operators of the parties to the agreement.  Agreements may also set out further rights that may be exercised with the approval of both parties on a case by case basis. That is often the case with fifth-freedom rights.   </p>  <p>  Ireland has traditionally held a liberal aviation policy that has proven hugely successful in expanding the international connectivity that is critical in underpinning business, foreign direct investment and tourism. As such we have maintained a broadly positive approach towards the grant of approval for additional competitive air services whether based on the exercise of fifth freedom rights or otherwise.</p>  <p>  The National Aviation Policy 2015 sets out an undertaking that the discretionary award of rights to provide air services based on a fifth freedom basis should take account of the views of stakeholders.

The DRS is provided for in section 99A of Finance Act 1999 and operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby a partial rebate of excise duty in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT) is available when the retail price of a litre of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 excluding VAT. The repayment rate increases as the retail price of diesel increases, up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre. In Budget 2020, the marginal rate of repayment was increased from 30% to 60% at prices over &euro;1.07 per litre excluding VAT. The rate of repayment is currently capped at 7.5 cent per litre which is reached when the average price of diesel, excluding VAT, is &euro;1.16 or more per litre.</p>  <p>  A repayment under the DRS may only be made to licensed road haulage and bus transport operators who purchase diesel in the State for use in qualifying motor vehicles. To qualify under the DRS, bus transport operators established in the State must hold either an international road passenger operator&rsquo;s licence or a national road passenger operator&rsquo;s licence issued under the Road Traffic and Transport Act 2006. Qualifying bus transport vehicles are those classified as an M2 or M3 vehicle under the EU &ldquo;type approval&rdquo; Regulation 2018/858, This includes buses, and minibuses with seating for a minimum of nine passengers. A school bus operator, appropriately licensed and using diesel purchased in the State in a qualifying vehicle, who wishes to avail of the DRS should register with Revenue. Full details on how to register for the DRS and submit claims online are given on Revenue&rsquo;s website.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in response to the current fuel crisis I recently introduced cuts in MOT rates applying to diesel and petrol that will continue until the end of August this year. MOT rates on diesel were cut by 15c per litre inclusive of VAT and this will be followed by a further 1 cent reduction to come into effect on 1 April and run until 11 October this year. This means that from 1 April the effective rate of MOT on diesel for operators qualifying under the DRS will be at the minimum level required under the Energy Tax Directive, 33 cents per litre.</p></reply>

In recognition of these pressures, a number of support measures are already in place to ease the burden on working parents. These include various tax-exempted<s></s>financial supports provided by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to assist parents to offset the costs of early learning and childcare and measures such as the Working Family Payment provided by the Minister for Social Protection.</p><p>With regard to taxation measures, and separate to the above:</p><p>The Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme for Childcare Services was introduced to encourage employers to develop childcare facilities onsite for their employees.  </p><p>www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-09/09-01-11 .pdf.</p><p>Individuals who provide child-minding services in their own home may claim childcare services relief each year, provided that they do not receive more than &euro;15,000 income per annum from the child-minding income.</p><p>www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/children/childcare-services/index.aspx.</p><p>Furthermore, a Single Person Child Carer tax credit of &euro;1,650 is available as well as an additional standard rate band of &euro;4,000. This credit and band is payable to any single person with a child under 18 years of age or over 18 years of age if in full time education or permanently incapacitated. The primary claimant may relinquish this credit and increase in the rate band to a secondary claimant with whom the child resides for not less than 100 days in the year.  </p><p>www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/children/single-person-child-carer-credit/index.aspx.</p><p>Providing a tax credit for parents in respect of childcare costs was considered by the Interdepartmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare in 2015 and was deemed to be a suboptimal approach to investing in affordability for parents.  Further details of that consideration are available in that report. </p><p>assets.gov.ie/36162/37cc5033f3124062912a416088a48827.pdf.</p><p>Finally, and as announced by my colleague, Minister O&rsquo;Gorman, Budget 2022 made provision for the introduction of a number of measures to support parents in respect of childcare costs.  The universal subsidy of the National Childcare Scheme will be extended to children of all ages and there will be a change to the practice of deducting hours spend in the Early Childhood Care and Education pre-school programme or school from the entitlement to subsidised hours of care.  A new Core Funding stream will come into effect from September 2022 which will require participating providers to maintain their fee levels at or below September 2021 levels.  This will ensure that the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme, and the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, are felt by parents. This will be preceded by a Transition Fund between May and August which will also require providers not to increase fees.</p></reply>

Indicative areas for BAR funding that were identified include: enterprise supports; measures to support fisheries and coastal communities; targeted supports for the agri-food sector; reskilling and retraining; and checks and controls at ports and airports.</p>  <p>  To allow Departments to proceed with programmes to be funded under the BAR, some &euro;54 million was allocated as initial funding in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2022.  Initial allocations were made to: the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation &amp;amp; Science (&euro;14.5 million) for the Skillnet Digital Skills Programme and Erasmus after Brexit initiatives; the Office of Public Works (&euro;1.8 million) to support their work developing the infrastructure for checks and controls at Rosslare Europort; the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine (&euro;33 million) as initial funding for fisheries  and horticulture measures; and the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment (&euro;5 million) as initial funding for a variety of schemes, including customs readiness, to support business impacted by Brexit.</p>  <p>  Further allocations will be made later in the year when, based on detailed proposals from Departments, there is more certainty on specific requirements and timelines for spending.</p></reply>

As part of the framework, the Commissioner will devise binding online safety codes that will set out how regulated online services, including social media services, are expected to deal with certain defined categories of harmful online content on their platforms. </p>  <p>  The categories of harmful online content set out in the OSMR Bill include online content that falls under the rubric of cyber harassment. These include certain offence-specific categories of online content, which are linked to existing criminal offences contrary to section 10(1) of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 (as amended), and the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020.  The Bill also provides for a further category of content, not related to an offence, by which a person bullies or humiliates another person (cyber bullying).</p>  <p>  It is intended that including these categories of content within the meaning of harmful online content in the Bill will have the effect of systematically tackling the availability, on designated online services, of such content online.  Under the Bill, in the event of a failure to comply with a relevant online safety code, and subject to Court approval, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services, including through financial sanctions of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of turnover.</p>  <p>  The Bill was initiated in the Seanad on 25 January of this year and completed Second Stage on 22 February. It is currently awaiting Committee stage in the Seanad. Given the importance of the Bill, I am keen to see it enacted by the Summer Recess. This would pave the way for the formal establishment of An Coimisi&uacute;n by Ministerial commencement order, which would allow An Coimisi&uacute;n begin the work of developing online safety codes to tackle harmful online content, including cyber harassment.</p></reply>

The purpose of these guidelines is to address planning issues on national primary and secondary roads outside of the 50-60km speed limit zones.</p>  <p>  Section 2.5 of the Spatial Planning and National Roads Guidelines (2012) outlines to planning authorities the policy approach to take regarding the creation of a new access onto national roads. The Guidelines require all development plans and any relevant local area plans to implement the policy approaches outlined below:</p>  <p>1.  Lands adjoining National Roads to which speed limits greater than 60 kmh apply: The policy of the planning authority will be to avoid the creation of any additional access point from new development or the generation of increased traffic from existing accesses to national roads to which speed limits greater than 60 kmh apply. This provision applies to all categories of development, including individual houses in rural areas, regardless of the housing circumstances of the applicant.</p>  <p>2.  Transitional Zones: Where the plan area incorporates sections of national roads on the approaches to or exit from urban centres that are subject to a speed limit of 60 kmh before a lower 50 kmh limit is encountered &ndash; otherwise known as transitional zones - the plan may provide for a limited level of direct access to facilitate orderly urban development. Any such proposal must, however, be subject to a road safety audit carried out in accordance with the NRA&rsquo;s requirements and a proliferation of such entrances, which would lead to a diminution in the role of such zones, must be avoided.</p>  <p>3.  Lands adjoining National Roads within 50 kmh speed limits: Access to national roads will be considered by planning authorities in accordance with normal road safety, traffic management and urban design criteria for built up areas.</p>  <p>  Section 2.6 outlines &lsquo;Exceptional Circumstances&rsquo; where planning authorities may identify stretches of national roads where a less restrictive approach may be applied, but only as part of the process of reviewing or varying the relevant development plan and having consulted and taken on board the advice of the NRA and having followed the approach outlined below:</p>  <p>  1. Developments of National and Regional Strategic Importance - This would not apply to one-off housing</p>  <p>  2. Lightly-trafficked Sections of National Secondary Routes - Such areas would be confined to lightly trafficked national secondary roads serving structurally weak and remote communities where a balance needs to be struck between the important transport functions of such roads and supporting the social and economic development of these areas. In such areas, policies in development plans permitting new accesses to national secondary roads may be considered acceptable where the following criteria apply:</p>  <p>  (I). Traffic volumes are low and are forecast to remain below 3,000 AADT (as verified by the NRA) for the next 20 years;</p>  <p>  (II). There is no suitable alternative non-national public road access available;</p>  <p>  (III). The development otherwise accords with the development plan, and</p>  <p>  (IV). Safety issues and considerations can be adequately addressed in accordance with the NRA&rsquo;s Design Manual for Roads and Bridges.</p>  <p>  In relation to the granting of permissions by local authorities, in making a decision in respect of an application for planning permission, planning authorities (and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to planning appeals) are required to consider such applications in the context of the relevant Development Plan, or Local Area Plan where one exists for the area, as well as any relevant Ministerial Guidelines including the Spatial Planning and National Roads Guidelines. In addition, the guidelines state that Transport Infrastructure Ireland (formerly National Roads Authority) must be a statutory consultee on all planning applications involving new access onto national roads. </p></reply>

The preferred scheme for the project involves an abstraction of water from the lower River Shannon at Parteen Basin in Co. Tipperary, with water treatment nearby at Birdhill. Treated water will then be piped 170km to a termination point reservoir at Peamount in County Dublin, connecting into the Greater Dublin Area.</p>  <p>  The project will also facilitate options to reinforce supplies of treated water to communities such as Newport, Borrisokane, Cloughjordan, Mullingar, Carlow, Portlaoise, Navan and Drogheda in the future. This will ensure that the long-term (2050 and beyond) water supply requirements of the region are met in a sustainable manner.</p>  <p>  The project is at the Preliminary Business Case (PBC) Stage of the Public Spending Code, which aims to develop further the strategic case for the project, consider in more detail the range of options available and decide whether there is a case for proceeding with the proposal.

The latest data shows that productivity in the construction sector remains below 2010 levels and is less productive than EU average.  Construction costs have risen considerably over recent years through  a combination of the increased cost of regulatory compliance and general increases in labour and materials costs. </p><p>Housing for All commits that the Government and relevant State agencies will advance methods to reduce residential construction costs, particularly the cost of apartment construction, by increasing the focus of existing and planned construction related initiatives on the residential construction sector, and by ensuring a coordinated, whole-of-government, approach to residential construction.</p><p>In this regard, the Government will enhance the intended role of the new Construction Technology Centre, which is under development by Enterprise Ireland, beyond the standard remit of Technology Centres in general for its first three years of operation in order to prioritise residential construction, in particular by incorporating:</p><p>-structures and funding to enable innovation in residential construction prior to the National Standards Authority of Ireland compliance processes, including demonstration, certification, standardisation and commercialisation as well as research and development; </p><p>-  a proactive role in strengthening the residential construction value chain;</p><p>-  promotion, development and support for innovation / modern methods of construction (MMCs) using digital and manufacturing technology; </p><p>-  support for SMEs to develop scale and to adopt MMCs and Building Information Modelling techniques for residential construction; and </p><p>-  support for digitisation in the manufacturing sector for residential construction e.g. digitally controlled manufacturing equipment. </p><p>This will be complemented by an increased focus for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform-led Construction Sector Group (CSG) on the residential construction sector. This will include the introduction and full implementation of a pipeline of cost reducing innovations and productivity measures, in line with its established remit to improve productivity and efficiency, and to control price inflation.</p><p>In addition the CSG supported by my Department are also in the process of preparing a study to carry out an analysis for each component of cost of construction (including cost of compliance) of house and apartment development, with a view to reducing cost (including cost of compliance) and increasing standardisation.  It will also identify opportunities for cost reduction for consideration by relevant Government departments and industry.</p><p>In accordance with Government policy, social housing construction projects (as with all publicly funded construction projects), must be procured in accordance with the Capital Works Management Framework.

The Affordable Housing Act 2021, the provisions of which I commenced in August and September 2021, laid the foundation for three new affordable housing schemes: 'Cost Rental' housing, the 'Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme', and the national 'First Home' shared equity scheme which will support purchases in the private market. </p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act provided for the establishment of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland. The introduction of Cost Rental tenancies helps to improve affordability and security in the rental market. Rent levels for Cost Rental tenancies are based on the cost of the provision of homes, rather than being subject to the pressures of the open market. Rents will increase only in line with consumer inflation, remaining stable in real terms while continuing to cover management and maintenance costs. The primary eligibility condition for Cost Rental is a maximum household income for new tenants, which was set by the Minister at &euro;53,000 net of taxes and pension contributions. This will ensure that Cost Rental homes benefit the target cohort of moderate-income households, who have incomes above the limits for social housing supports but who are facing affordability pressures in the private rental market.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered from 2021 to 2026 by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding, along with funding for Local Authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund. The Land Development Agency will also deliver Cost Rental, either on its own portfolio of sites or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh. All Cost Rental projects will achieve cost-covering rents at least 25% below comparable open market rates. </p>  <p>  The first 65 CREL-funded Cost Rental homes were tenanted by the Cl&uacute;id AHB in 2021, with 25 at Taylor Hill in Balbriggan and a further 40 at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip. Both developments delivered cost-covering rents at least 40% below comparable open-market prices. The tenanting process is currently underway by the Tuath AHB for a further 44 new Cost Rental homes at the Parklands development in Citywest, also supported by CREL funding, with projected rents of &euro;1,264/month for 2-bed apartments and &euro;1,297/month for 2-bed duplexes. Tenants will also soon be moving into a further 50 Cost Rental homes at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, which are being delivered by the Tuath and Respond AHBs in collaboration with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</p>  <p>  Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Act underpins the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, under which Local Authorities will make homes available to eligible buyers using an equity share model. Following engagement with legal counsel, as well as with the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and the County and City Management Association (CCMA), secondary legislation for the scheme is at an advanced stage and these Regulations will be issued in the coming weeks. The Regulations will include the format for notification of sale of such dwellings by a Local Authority, the application process, eligibility criteria, the form of the purchase arrangement, matters relating to redemption of the Local Authority's equity interest, and provision for a Local Authority to choose to implement a Scheme of Priority for ranking applications. </p>  <p>  The first new homes under this scheme will be made available on an administrative basis at Boherboy in Cork this month. Cork City Council has indicated these will cost &euro;218,000 for a 2-bedroom and &euro;243,000 for a 3-bedroom dwelling. These will be followed by a scheme at Dun Emer in Dublin, where Fingal County Council has indicated a 2-bed apartment will cost &euro;166,000, and a 3-bed dwelling will be between &euro;206,000 and &euro;258,000. In addition, South Dublin County Council has recently advertised 16 homes in Kilcarbery that will cost between &euro;245,600 and &euro;285,300. </p>  <p>  Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act provides the basis for the First Home Scheme, which will be available nationwide. This scheme will support eligible first-time buyers to buy a new-build home in private developments by means of an equity share model, similar to that used in the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme. </p>  <p>  First Home will operate for the period 2022 to 2026 and deploy overall funding of c. &euro;400 million, jointly funded by the State and participating mortgage lenders. A new First Home Designated Activity Company, incorporated in December, will operate this scheme. Significant work is continuing on the detailed design and parameters of the scheme, and full details will be confirmed upon completion of this work. It is anticipated that initial activity on key areas of work, including public communications, will be undertaken over the next months in advance of First Home&rsquo;s first receipt of applications and deployment of equity support, scheduled for Q2 this year. </p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, I announced a new Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021-2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61m. Following extensive engagement with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works etc. were received. The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p>  <p>  -  area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.);</p>  <p>  -  established Health and Safety needs;</p>  <p>  -  state of development of the project (is site acquired?, etc.); and </p>  <p>  -  value for money offered by the proposal.</p>  <p>  This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally. </p>  <p>  Kerry County Council has indicated that the upgrade of Killarney fire station is one of their fire station priority projects, and funding for this is provided for in this Capital Programme, with an estimated cost of &euro;366,000 excluding VAT. </p>  <p>  Under the Annual Fire Services Capital Programmes, Departmental grant-aid of just over &euro;398,000 from 2016 &ndash; 2021 has contributed to the provision of a new &ldquo;Class B&rdquo; appliance (engine), two vans, a 4WD pick-up truck and Community Smoke Alarms for Kerry Fire Service. The Service has also been allocated a new &ldquo;Class B&rdquo; appliance under the 2021 -2023 Appliance Procurement Programme at an estimated cost of c. &euro;480,000.

Normal practice is for an indicative schedule of future meetings to be agreed at each NSMC plenary meeting.</p>  <p>  At the plenary meeting on 30 July 2021, an indicative schedule of meetings was agreed, including a plenary meeting in December 2021. This plenary meeting did not take place. Due to the DUP&rsquo;s continued withdrawal from participation in NSMC meetings and the need for cross-community representation at those meetings, only nine of the 27 meetings initially planned for 2021 took place. This is deeply regrettable. The Council&rsquo;s next meeting is not expected until a new Executive is formed following Assembly elections in May.</p>  <p>  The NSMC, which was established under Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement to develop consultation, cooperation, and action within the island of Ireland, is the formal means for advancing North-South cooperation. In the Council, the Government works with the Executive to advance areas of practical cooperation to our mutual benefit. This is particularly important at a time when we need to support communities and businesses across the island to recover from the pandemic. </p>  <p>  No positive agenda is served by the breakdown of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, either the NSMC or indeed the Executive, which has also been impacted by recent political instability.</p>  <p>  Despite the current absence of formal meetings of the NSMC, practical initiatives previously agreed in the framework of the Council continue to operate and to deliver significant benefits for citizens, North and South. The important work of the North South Implementation Bodies, which operate under the auspices of the NSMC, also continues. </p>  <p>  My Government colleagues and I look forward to increased engagement with the Executive in the period ahead, through Ministerial meetings in the NSMC&rsquo;s policy sectors to deliver projects that benefit communities across the island. The NSMC is essential to overseeing and developing North-South cooperation on matters of mutual interest, and thus it is crucial that the Council is not further impeded from achieving this.</p></reply>

The TCA builds upon the previous Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, in setting out the architecture of the EU-UK relationship.</p>  <p>  Effective implementation of the TCA is a priority for Ireland. Not only does it underpin our trade and business relationship with Great Britain, but it also provides for cooperation in a wide range of areas of significance to us. It also creates a platform for building further cooperation into the future.</p>  <p>  While no agreement could have replaced the seamless relationship with the UK enjoyed prior to Brexit, the TCA provides for tariff- and quota-free goods trade between the EU and Great Britain as well as preferential arrangements in areas such as transport, energy, fisheries, and policing. The agreement is underpinned by extensive governance structures as well as provisions to ensure a continued level playing field and processes for resolving any disputes that might arise.</p>  <p>  The EU and the UK have been meeting regularly through the TCA&rsquo;s governance structures over the past year, including at highest level, in the EU-UK Partnership Council. All of the Specialised Committees, the forums for EU-UK engagement across each of the areas covered by the agreement, have now met at least once, and initial discussions have largely been productive. Each of these Committees shall meet at least once a year, as set out in the TCA. A number of the Specialised Committees, such as energy, are expected to meet for the second time in the coming months. Ireland has actively contributed to the preparation of the EU side&rsquo;s position for those meetings and we continue to work very closely, with the European Commission, on the overall implementation of the agreement. </p>  <p>  The TCA also establishes an EU-UK Parliamentary Partnership Assembly, providing for the participation of political representatives. The EU has set up a Domestic Advisory Group and is in the process of creating a Civil Society Forum, both of which provide a platform for NGOs, business, trade unions and other groups to advise and share their views on the implementation of the Agreement. </p></reply>

We met in London on 6 January and in Munich on 19 February. We also spoke on 28 January after the Foreign Secretary&rsquo;s visit to Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Protocol is the only agreed EU-UK solution that protects the Good Friday Agreement, prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, and ensures the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place within it. </p>  <p>  I have emphasised to the Foreign Secretary that Ireland and the EU remain fully committed to providing certainty and stability for people and businesses in Northern Ireland. The EU has spared no effort in listening to the concerns of people in Northern Ireland and bringing forward a far-reaching and pragmatic package of proposals that would address the issues that matter most to them. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, EU-UK discussions on the implementation of the Protocol are ongoing. I welcome that these talks are continuing and it is positive that EU-UK joint statements have expressed determination to ensure durable solutions are found as soon as possible for the benefit of people and businesses in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  Northern Ireland is already seeing the benefits of the Protocol, with numerous jobs and investment announcements made over the last year based on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s unique access under the Protocol to both the EU Single Market for goods and the rest of the UK internal market. Most people and businesses in Northern Ireland want to take advantage of this unique trading position. Businesses have consistently said that they need stability, certainty and predictability.</p>  <p>  I, of course, have also discussed the situation in Ukraine with Foreign Secretary Truss where the EU and the UK are standing together to support Ukraine in the face of Russia&rsquo;s abhorrent and illegal aggression. I hope that this spirit of partnership can extend to the talks on the implementation of the Protocol. A positive outcome to these discussions will allow us to turn a page and develop a forward-looking EU-UK partnership. There are a range of urgent global challenges which require the EU and UK to work together. A strong bilateral British-Irish relationship is also vital for the Irish and British Governments to fulfil our roles as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and to advance cooperation across a wide range of sectors.</p>  <p>  I will remain in close contact with British Government Ministers, including the Foreign Secretary, in the period ahead and will continue to encourage the British Government to engage constructively with the EU so that we can make progress for the benefit of people and businesses across Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

These include concerns expressed around a series of UK unilateral extensions to various grace periods, and the limited EU access to customs and goods movement data. Accordingly in March 2021, the Commission issued a letter of formal notice to the UK Government beginning infringement proceedings. In July 2021, the Commission paused the infringement process to provide the space for talks to find durable solutions to the implementation of the Protocol. </p>  <p>  EU-UK talks on the implementation of the Protocol are ongoing. I welcome the meetings of the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee on 21 February, and the meeting of the Specialised Committee on the Protocol held on 8 March. I note the determination expressed in the resulting joint statements, to ensure that durable solutions are found as soon as possible for the benefit of people and businesses in Northern Ireland. The EU and the UK have committed to continuing their talks and to further engagement with business groups, civil society, and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland. The talks must remain focussed on their concerns. The EU&rsquo;s proposals published last October directly address those concerns around SPS and customs movements, medicines and giving greater voice to Northern Irish stakeholders in the implementation of the Protocol.</p>  <p>  Although there have been genuine challenges with regard to the implementation of the Protocol, I continue to believe that it will work if we allow it to with flexibility and pragmatism. The EU has spared no effort in listening to the concerns of people in Northern Ireland and bringing forward practical solutions that would address the issues that matter most to them. This flexibility now needs to be reciprocated by the UK.</p>  <p>  I continue to engage regularly with stakeholders in Northern Ireland, including the leaders of the Northern Ireland political parties, the business community, and civic society. I remain in close and regular contact with Vice-President &Scaron;efcovic, and with our partners across the EU. The Union is seized of this matter &ndash; the implementation of the Protocol is a very regular topic of discussion within the Council and the European Parliament. Support for the Commission approach to UK engagement and for minimising disruption in Northern Ireland remains steadfast across the Union. I also have regular engagement with both the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the UK Foreign Secretary. </p>  <p>  I and officials in my Department will continue to monitor developments closely in the coming period and to encourage the British Government to engage constructively with the EU so that we can make progress for the benefit of people and businesses across Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

The Agreements, as well as the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.</p>  <p>  The Civic Forum was first established under Strand One of the Good Friday Agreement, as a consultative mechanism on social, economic and cultural issues. It comprised representative sectors of society, including the business, trade union and voluntary sectors, as provided for by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. It was to be reviewed at the time of the suspension of the institutions in 2002 and was not reconvened.</p>  <p>  The 2014 Stormont House Agreement proposed the formation of a Compact Civic Advisory Panel.  It was agreed as part of the New Decade New Approach agreement by the Northern Irish parties that this panel should be reformed and that 1-2 issues per year, as identified by the Executive, would be commissioned for civic engagement, with the Panel to propose the most appropriate model for specific issues including one Citizens Assembly a year. </p>  <p>  The Government supports the implementation of this commitment, alongside all those made as part of NDNA.  Progress on these commitments will be considered at further Implementation Review meetings involving the two Governments and the Northern Ireland parties. The first NDNA Implementation Review Meeting took place virtually in January 2021, attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the First and deputy First Ministers, and the leaders of the parties in the Executive. We would wish to see a second review meeting at the earliest possible date, but this may prove challenging in the context of the upcoming Assembly elections.</p>  <p>  The Government also continues to support the establishment of the North South Consultative Forum, as provided for under Strand Two of the Good Friday Agreement, representative of civil society and comprising social partners and other members with expertise in social, cultural, economic and other issues. The Government has worked to move the issue forward, submitting proposals to the Northern Ireland Executive for its consideration. We have also raised the issue at successive plenary meetings of the North South Ministerial Council.</p></reply>

The package of language and identity legislation agreed in NDNA was detailed and balanced and should be implemented. As outlined in the Programme for Government, the full implementation of the Agreement is an important priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  With respect to the introduction of language and identity legislation, in the absence of progress in the Assembly, I welcome the commitment by the British Government to take this forward as soon as possible in Westminster.

Funding of &euro;1.2m per annum for 2021-2023 has been allocated for the development of Irish language broadcasting, and the promotion of the Irish language in Northern Ireland, which is being administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (D/TCAGSM). &euro;1.2m over three years (2020-22) has been allocated to further support for the Irish language in Northern Ireland. Additional funding has also been provided to facilitate an All Island expansion of the existing Irish Language Network strategy. </p></reply>

This reflects collective EU solidarity with Ukraine and intensive work by the Member States and the EU institutions.  The EU has imposed unprecedented sanctions against Russia.  The principal rationale of these actions is to incentivise Russia to find a political solution to the conflict that President Putin has created, and to reduce the funding available to Russia to continue its illegal actions in Ukraine.  At the most recent meeting of Foreign Ministers on 21 March 2022, I discussed the impact of these sanctions with my colleagues and the options for implementing further measures.  </p>  <p>  The EU has also committed over a billion euros in support to Ukraine.  Ireland is contributing to a number of EU mechanisms to assist Ukraine, including the new European Peace Facility. We have also contributed to the EU&rsquo;s Civil Protection Mechanism, and we are engaged on discussions on coordinating the EU&rsquo;s response to help the millions of people, mostly women and children, who have been forced to flee Ukraine.</p>  <p>  At the United Nations, Ireland has been at the forefront of efforts to hold Russia internationally accountable for its actions. As a member of the Security Council we are fully committed to ensuring that the situation in Ukraine continues to be considered by the Council.  We have actively supported Security Council and General Assembly meetings on Ukraine, and have urged others to join us in condemning Russia&rsquo;s invasion and in calling on Russia to immediately withdraw its forces from the entire territory of Ukraine. </p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our partners, will continue to support genuine efforts at the UN Security Council to ensure safe and unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to those who need it, and to call for full respect of international humanitarian law.  We have backed this up with concrete support and a package of &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid (from Irish Aid), as well as medical supplies from the HSE, which is being disbursed through our partners in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. </p>  <p>  Ireland stands ready to support any initiative which can achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict, and which respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders.  My Department is monitoring developments in relation to efforts to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict and stands ready to support initiatives which can deliver peace in line with international law, particularly international humanitarian law as well as international human rights norms and standards. </p></reply>

The Department of Taoiseach is coordinating the response across all relevant domestic stakeholders, including with the Department of Justice, the Department of Housing, the Department of Social Protection, and the  Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work closely with colleagues across Government as part of this  coordinated national response.  The Department is also working to ensure the delivery of the &euro;20 million in humanitarian aid which is already being disbursed through our partners in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  On 4 March 2022 the EU agreed to activate the Temporary Protection Directive which allows for beneficiaries to receive the support and protection of the Irish State through a quick and streamlined process.  Such people have protection status for up to a year (with a possibility of extension where appropriate so overall period would not exceed three years), and would be entitled to access employment and State supports including, accommodation, healthcare and social welfare on the same basis as Irish Nationals.</p>  <p>  Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Moldova have received more than 3.5 million refugees and demonstrated tremendous solidarity and generosity.  The humanity and the effectiveness of their response has been outstanding. The burden needs to be shared equitably amongst EU Member States and the Government is committed to ensuring that Ireland plays its part.</p></reply>

Ireland supports the European Union (EU), United Nations (UN), and other international efforts to reduce the influence of Boko Haram and al-Shabaab, and to prevent their attacks, especially against civilians and humanitarian workers and facilities. Ireland continues to monitor the activities of these groups and to assist populations affected by their actions.</p>  <p>  Through Irish Aid, the Government's official aid programme, Ireland is tackling poverty, hunger, and exclusion, which can be drivers of support for groups such as Boko Haram and al-Shabaab, as well as responding to humanitarian need, in regions affected by conflict. Recipients of Irish Aid funding include Concern Worldwide, Goal, Plan International Ireland, and Tr&oacute;caire, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and UN agencies and programmes. As an EU Member State, Ireland also contributes to the significant EU development and humanitarian response in countries affected by Boko Haram and al-Shabaab.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, Irish Aid has allocated &euro;34 million in humanitarian funding to alleviate the conditions of people in distress across the Lake Chad region &ndash; including North-East Nigeria, where the numbers of people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection are at the highest levels recorded. Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;57 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Somalia, including to communities displaced by conflict from al-Shabaab-held areas. In early 2022, Ireland made an additional contribution to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund to respond to the intensifying drought. With humanitarian needs in these regions remaining acute, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.</p>  <p>  Through the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS) and the UN Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations is helping stabilise the situation in the Lake Chad region. Ireland is penholder, together with Niger, on the UNOWAS file at the UN Security Council. In its Presidential Statement on peace consolidation in West Africa of 17 August 2021, the Security Council strongly condemned continued attacks against civilians in the region, and both attacks and threats of attacks against schools, children, and educational personnel, including recent abductions in Nigeria. Additionally, Ireland is a member of the International Support Group of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin (ISG), and has observer status at the Sahel Alliance: both are forums which enable donors to coordinate support in addressing the challenges in Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin.</p>  <p>  The UN-mandated African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which is primarily funded by the EU, assists the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts to combat al-Shabaab. Ireland is supportive of plans to further transition security responsibilities to the Somali Security Forces. Ireland is Chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee at the UN Security Council, which oversees an arms embargo and other tools to encourage a more peaceful and secure Somalia. This complements Ireland&rsquo;s role as an EU Member State supporting development and governance in Somalia, including the strengthening of its institutions.</p>  <p>  The EU has three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Missions in the Horn of Africa. A number of Irish nationals are deployed to the civilian mission EUCAP Somalia, including the Head of Mission. In the Sahel, Ireland currently has 20 Defence Forces personnel participating in EUTM Mali. Ireland also deploys one expert to the civilian mission EUCAP Sahel Niger. Fourteen Defence Forces personnel are deployed in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these missions allows Ireland to contribute to peace and security, help protect human rights, and put in place conditions for sustainable development.</p></reply>

Evidence tells us that they are time and again disproportionately affected by conflict and natural disasters, exacerbating pre-existing gender norms and inequalities. Humanitarian crises disrupt family and social networks, change the roles played by different genders and break down protection structures.</p>  <p>  Existing inequalities for women and girls risk being further exacerbated during and after a crisis. The widest gender gaps exist in countries where there is a humanitarian appeal. An alarming 70 percent of women experience gender-based violence (GBV) in humanitarian contexts compared to 25 percent worldwide. Adolescent girls in conflict zones are 90 percent more likely to be out of school than girls in non-conflict settings. Sixty percent of preventable maternal mortality takes place in settings of conflict, displacement and natural disasters.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 exacerbated domestic violence and also brought about an additional 13 million cases of child marriage.</p>  <p>  In today&rsquo;s armed conflicts, there is often no longer a clearly demarcated battlefield - attacks on schools and hospitals are on the rise. Conflicts in urban areas, with women and children in the frontline. The consequences of these brutal trends are devastating. More women and children are going hungry, are falling victim to preventable diseases and are trapped on the front-line without access to humanitarian aid. In many contexts children are often at risk of recruitment by armed groups.</p>  <p>  The harm that is done to children in armed conflict is not only often more severe than that done to adults, it has longer lasting implications &ndash; for children themselves and for their societies.</p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to ensuring that the needs and capacities of women and children are at the heart of global humanitarian action. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is driving improvements in the collection and analysis of sex and age disaggregated data &ndash; enabling the humanitarian system to target those most in need, including women and children.  Gender was a priority for Ireland during our period as chair of the OCHA donor support group in 2018-19, and also as donor chair of the ICRC donor support group in 2019-20.</p>  <p>  The humanitarian community has responded by putting the needs of women and children at the centre of humanitarian action, part of their focus on the most vulnerable groups.  This includes the provision of safe spaces for children, child protection services, emergency education and health care services, and income generating opportunities. Humanitarian actors also provide legal aid, GBV services and psychological support to vulnerable groups, including women and children.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the specific needs of women and girls, there are several humanitarian agencies with specific expertise in this area. These include UN agencies such as UNHCR, UNICEF and UNFPA as well as many NGOs. Ireland is a strong supporter of these agencies, and provides flexible, annual funding. In our recent response to the Ukraine crisis Ireland provided additional funding of &euro;1 million to UNICEF, &euro;1.5 million to UNFPA and &euro;5 million to UNHCR. Ireland also provides annual funding of &euro;1.8 million to the International Rescue Committee, an NGO with specific expertise in the prevention and response to GBV.</p></reply>

Its effective implementation contributes towards eliminating violence against women and girls, as set out in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 5.2.</p>  <p>  At the EU level, Ireland and all EU member states assess military export licence applications on a case-by-case basis against the eight criteria of the Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP of 8 December 2008 defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment. These criteria include an assessment of the end destination&rsquo;s respect for international commitments; respect for human rights and international humanitarian law; and the internal political situation and preservation of regional peace, stability and security in the country of final destination.</p>  <p>  In line with the National Action Plan for the implementation of UNSCR 1325 and related resolutions, gender analyses continue to be integrated into Ireland&rsquo;s work in conflict-affected contexts and on peace and security issues, including in relation to disarmament. Ireland has continued to utilise its leadership role as co-chair of the International Gender Champions Disarmament Impact Group (DIG) to work for the increased participation of women in disarmament discussions. The full, equal and meaningful participation of women in arms control and disarmament is critical.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to promote the strengthening of disarmament and arms control measures, given our firm belief that this will contribute to the reduction of GBV, among other aims.</p></reply>

Conflicts such as that in northern Ethiopia (in which Eritrean forces are also embroiled), the conflict and violence in Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan, the ongoing efforts to ensure a democratic transition in Sudan, the Sudan/Ethiopia border dispute, and tensions over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) are combining to reverse the development and peace gains of recent years.</p>  <p>  Conflict and inter-state disputes in the region are unfolding against the background of climate-induced shocks, including the worst drought in decades. In February, the World Food Programme assessed that 13 million people in the Horn faced severe hunger. The impact of the invasion of Ukraine on food supplies has prompted revised estimates, with 20 million in Sudan alone expected to struggle with acute hunger in 2022.</p>  <p>  Peace and stability in the Horn of Africa is a priority for Ireland, including in our role on the UN Security Council where the situations in Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan are regular agenda items. Ireland is the unofficial penholder at the Council on Ethiopia, in addition to chairing the Somalia Sanctions Committee and playing a prominent role in discussions on Sudan and South Sudan. Ireland has partnered with African members of the Council to address thematic areas of particular pertinence to the region, such as climate and security; Women Peace and Security, and conflict and hunger. Ireland has worked to ensure participation of civil society from the Horn of Africa in debates on relevant peace and security agenda items, prioritising women peacebuilders, in particular during our Presidency of the Council in September 2021.</p>  <p>  In July 2021, Minister Coveney visited Kenya and Somalia for a series of high-level political meetings designed to inform Ireland&rsquo;s work on the Council, deepen bilateral relations, and enhance collaboration on regional security challenges.  Both bilaterally and through the European Union, Ireland supports the peace and security capacities and leadership of organisations such as the African Union and IGAD (the Intergovernmental Authority on Development) in tackling the region&rsquo;s crises. Ireland also works closely with the Office of the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa. At the European Union, the Human Rights Council and the United Nations more broadly, Ireland will continue to highlight the human rights and humanitarian imperatives in the Horn: only by taking a people-driven, ground-up approach to security can sustainable peace in the Horn be achieved. Between 2012 and 2021, Ireland provided over &euro;267 million in humanitarian and development funding to the region.</p></reply>

In addition to the tragic loss of life, disasters force millions from their homes and impact on their abilities to earn a living or grow food. It is too often the most vulnerable people in societies who are most affected by natural disasters, which impact disproportionately on women and girls. </p>  <p>  In 2021, climate change joined conflict as a root cause of famine, as evidenced in drought-affected Madagascar. Storms and flooding are becoming more intense, while protracted and repeated droughts are the new norm in many countries. All too often these events are taking place in places where the institutional capacity to cope with such shocks is extremely limited. </p>  <p>  At the beginning of each year, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs publishes the Global Humanitarian Overview.  This maps out global humanitarian needs, including countries suffering the impact of natural disasters, and is a guide to donors as to where their resource allocation can have maximum impact. The Overview is updated on a monthly basis. At the end of February, for example, an additional 540,000 people affected by Storm Anna in Malawi were included in the number of people in need of assistance.</p>  <p>  While it is not possible to predict all natural disasters, an estimated half of today&rsquo;s crises are somewhat predictable. Improvements in data and predictive analytics enable more accurate forecasting of certain types of shocks or crises and their likely impact. This supports the humanitarian community to respond before the crisis peaks. This approach has been used in response to drought in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa and floods Bangladesh. </p>  <p>  Ireland is very supportive of this anticipatory action. We carefully select partners and funding mechanisms that are able to respond swiftly and efficiently to minimise the impact of natural disasters on the most vulnerable populations. At a UN High-Level Event on Anticipatory Action in September 2021, Ireland stated that in 2020 close to a quarter of its humanitarian funding - approximately &euro;45 million out of a total &euro;192 million - was channelled to mechanisms that support anticipatory action.  </p>  <p>  Ireland, together with other donors, continues to monitor the evolving needs of those suffering from the impact of natural disasters, drawing on the most up-to-date information and data to ensure that Irish Aid assistance continues to support the vulnerable populations most impacted by natural disasters, and is ready to respond quickly to emerging needs.  The OECD, in a 2020 review of Irish Aid, found that Irish Aid's 'very flexible funding models, especially for humanitarian assistance, could provide useful inspiration to other.. donors.'</p></reply>

Those figures have already increased due to the invasion of Ukraine and deteriorating conditions in other countries, including due to the emerging food crisis due to challenges to grain and fertilizer exports from Ukraine and Russia. </p>  <p>  Responding to the needs identified in the 2021 Global Humanitarian Overview, donors such as Ireland ensured that food, medicines, health care and other essential assistance and protection were delivered to 107 million people.  The needs of the most vulnerable, particularly women and girls, were prioritised. </p>  <p>  Each year, Flash Appeals are launch in response to emerging humanitarian needs, as happened last year for example in response to the drought in Southern Madagascar and Typhoon Rai/Odette in the Philippines. </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to plays its part within the international humanitarian system:  consistently ranked amongst the top 20 humanitarian donors, the OECD in its 2020 review of Irish Aid found Ireland to be &lsquo;an excellent humanitarian partner&rsquo; whose &lsquo;flexible funding models, especially for humanitarian assistance, could provide useful inspiration to other donors.&rsquo; </p>  <p>  Irish Aid&rsquo;s humanitarian spend was &euro;192 million in 2020, and final figures for 2021 will show a further increase.  Irish Aid funding to UN agencies, the Red Cross Family and NGOs supports large-scale crises, such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Syria and Yemen, while also supporting crisis response in places no longer in the headlines, for example the Central African Republic. In 2021 Irish Aid responded to a number of Flash Appeals, including the volcanic eruption in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the earthquake in Haiti. </p>  <p>  Importantly, Irish Aid funding is predictable and flexible, giving partners the ability to respond immediately to emerging needs and also to plan for multi-annual interventions where necessary.  This approach has meant that partners had pre-positioned Irish Aid funding, enabling their immediate response to humanitarian needs in Ukraine and ensuring that there are structures in place on the ground to maximise the impact of the &euro;20 million Irish Aid Ukraine humanitarian response package released in recent weeks.</p></reply>

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries. Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Albania, alongside Turkey, are all currently recognised as candidates for membership of the European Union.</p>  <p>  The European Commission presented Member States with the main findings and recommendations of the seven country reports last October in their &lsquo;Enlargement Package&rsquo;. While situations vary from country to country, the report noted limited progress in the enlargement process overall due to both the impact of the pandemic and ongoing delays and blockages in the enlargement process. It also noted a general stagnation in progress in the crucial areas of fundamental rights and rule of law.</p>  <p>  While technically remaining the two front-runners in terms of EU accession, there is general agreement within both Council and Commission that both Serbia and Montenegro need to increase the dynamism in their reform agenda. Serbia needs to accelerate its reforms regarding fundamental rights and the rule of law, and make significant progress in the normalisation of relations with Kosovo. More recently it has been noted that a stronger showing of support for EU values will be needed if Serbia is to advance its accession process.</p>  <p>  In Montenegro, more intensive efforts in relation to freedom of expression, media freedom and the fight against corruption and organised crime are required. I have also urged intensified dialogue among all parties in Montenegro to address those issues currently giving rise to tensions within the country.</p>  <p>  Both North Macedonia and Albania have clearly fulfilled the conditions necessary to commence accession negotiations. In our view, shared almost unanimously within the Council, the negotiating frameworks for both countries should be agreed and Intergovernmental Conferences held as soon as possible to start the accession process.</p>  <p>  Although a candidate country and an important partner for the EU, accession negotiations with Turkey have stalled for a number of years and are likely to remain so until the government of President Erdogan makes sustained efforts to address some long-standing concerns regarding the internal human rights situation within Turkey and its respect for rule of law and observance of fundamental rights.</p>  <p>  Currently, EU relations with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia are set within the framework of the Eastern Partnership. &lsquo;Association Agreements&rsquo; and &lsquo;Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements&rsquo; (DCFTAs) are in place with all three aimed at promoting deeper political ties, stronger economic links and ensuring respect for common values. While some progress has been made over the years towards closer integration with the EU, progress on reforms has been slow overall.</p>  <p>  Following discussion at the informal European Council in Versailles on 10-11 March, the European Commission has been invited to provide their assessment of Ukraine&rsquo;s preparedness for EU accession along with that of Moldova and Georgia which have also submitted applications to join the EU. This will be based on a number of criteria, primarily each country&rsquo;s capacity to align with the EU acquis. Analysis of this level understandably takes time and in the past, it has taken up to three years for the Commission to revert to the Council with their opinion. Typically, the opinion will set out a number of deliverables to be fulfilled by the country, before it can be considered an official candidate country. Once the opinion is accepted by the Council, the country becomes a potential candidate country (similar to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo), entitling them to extra technical support and guidance under a stabilisation agreement with a view to boosting the country&rsquo;s preparedness for accession. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support strongly the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU.</p></reply>

At the beginning of 2022, the United Nations estimated that 274 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance in 63 countries across the globe. Since then, an additional 10 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, mainly as a result of the Ukraine crisis. Conflict is the most significant driver of the record level of humanitarian need and the impact is felt most greatly on vulnerable groups, including women and children.</p>  <p>  Reducing humanitarian need is one of the four key priorities in Ireland's development policy, A Better World. Ireland prioritises the provision of needs-based, principled humanitarian aid to major humanitarian crises such as Yemen, but also to &lsquo;forgotten crises&rsquo; which receive less attention, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic and Sudan. </p>  <p>  Our strong and enduring commitment to effective multilateralism, particularly through our membership of the European Union and the United Nations, is critical to maximising Ireland&rsquo;s response to conflict and fragility around the globe. </p>  <p>  We have been actively using our current role as an elected member of the UN Security Council in this context. Our approach at the Security Council is underpinned by three core principles: Building Peace, Strengthening Conflict Prevention, and Ensuring Accountability. In line with these, our priorities include: highlighting potential drivers of conflict, such as climate and food insecurity; improving peacekeeping mandates; and promoting respect for international law and accountability. Ireland has been active right across the Council agenda on regional issues, including Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria, Iran and the Middle East, and on thematic issues, such as climate and security; women, peace and security; and the protection of civilians in armed conflict. We have a number of formal roles and responsibilities, and we have also led the Council&rsquo;s response to the situation in Ethiopia. We always aim to play a constructive role, and to help the Council fulfil its key role in the maintenance of international peace and security. </p>  <p>  Regarding the further invasion of Ukraine by Russia, supported by Belarus, our efforts are aimed at bringing an end to this war as soon as possible, ensuring accountability for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and meeting the humanitarian needs of those caught in the midst of violence. Ensuring inclusivity in all of these elements, and in particular, the full, equal and meaningful participation of women and girls is vital.</p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our partners, will continue to support genuine efforts at the UN Security Council to ensure safe and unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to those who need it, and to call for full respect of international humanitarian law.</p></reply>

The report was published on the 9th February 2022.  </p>  <p>  The Commission undertook a significant body of work encompassing their wide-ranging terms of reference.  The report contains 69 main recommendations and together with sub recommendations, there are 130 recommendations.  The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  </p>  <p>  The report proposes significant changes for the Defence Forces, including to Defence Forces culture, high-level command and control structures, and for the level of Defence provision in Ireland.  Clearly, there are matters that will require careful consideration and in some critical aspects inter-departmental discussion and agreement. This includes the level of resourcing that may be allocated to Defence, legislative implications and the governance framework that will be required to underpin any changes the Government approve on foot of the Commission's report. </p>  <p>  I will also be seeking the views of my Department and the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces Representative Associations will be consulted on all matters that fall within the scope of representation, relating to the implementation of any approved plan.  I will also engage with key stakeholders and the Oireachtas, and I welcome the D&aacute;il statement on the report which took place on the 16th February.  I firmly believe that this is an opportunity to have a mature debate around the type of defence capabilities that we require and I am very much open to such a discussion. Current events are highlighting the importance of such a debate.</p>  <p>  The intent is that following relevant consultation, and before the summer recess, I will revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan. This high level plan will set out proposed timelines and oversight arrangements for its implementation.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is obliged to tender all works, goods and services to be provided by external suppliers in line with national and EU procurement legislation and this includes services provided by contractors under the School Transport Scheme.  Compliant tenders are evaluated against published award criteria. Successful tenderers are awarded a contract for up to five years. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education is considering in consultation with other relevant departments and Bus &Eacute;ireann the implications that increasing fuel costs may have on the provision of school transport services.  The Department is also very aware of the potential impact of the current situation unfolding in Ukraine which is impacting fuel prices further. </p>  <p>  Government has announced a reduction in excise on fuel will result in a decrease in the cost of fuel.  The reduction of 20 cent per litre on petrol and 15 cent per litre on diesel will be in place until 31 August at an estimated cost of &euro;320m. This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will know, we already support a linguistically and culturally diverse community in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department is responding to immediate needs through the provision of school places locally as need arises, and planning for the medium and long-term in alignment with the whole of Government approach, having regard to the need for rapidity and scale.  </p>  <p>  There is a helpline for schools who have queries regarding Ukrainian students, and my Department will be sharing information online and on social media for parents in relevant languages to support them in accessing schooling for children.  </p>  <p>  The utilisation of capacity within existing schools across the country will be a very important aspect for addressing the need for education provision for Ukrainian children. My Department already has data on capacity and under/over subscription at individual schools from its National Inventory of School Capacity based on schools&rsquo; annual enrolment returns, and utilises its Geographic Information System to facilitate spatial analysis of this and other data. </p>  <p>  At both primary and post-primary level there are significant variances in available capacity at local and regional level across the country, in both rural and urban areas. Ultimately, the location of the accommodation provided for the Ukrainian families will be relevant in maximising the utilisation of existing school capacity to meet their education needs and my Department is coordinating with other Government Departments in this respect, with a view to ensuring alignment of our planning processes as much as possible.</p>  <p>  Schools with available capacity to accommodate arriving Ukrainian children will be supported with the provision of additional furniture where that is required. My Department already provides additional allocations for schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support.  If a school has additional needs arising from the usual requirement, the school can apply for additional supports. </p>  <p>  The Teacher Education Support Services are also prioritising requests from schools who are enrolling children coming from Ukraine. </p>  <p>  A working group has been formed to consider language and cultural resources and supports for teachers and schools. The group includes representatives of the Department (including NEPs), its inspectorate, the teacher education support services, the NCCA and the ETB sector.</p>  <p>  The group is assessing and sharing existing relevant resources and supports, and identifying any gaps which need to be addressed through the provision of additional resources and supports both in the short term and over the medium to longer term. All relevant resources and supports are currently being collated and made available on one central website for schools and teachers to access. New CPD supports are being designed and developed also and will be made available to schools and teachers shortly.  </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has published a range of resources to support learners with English as an additional language (EAL) across Early Childhood, Primary and Post-Primary. These materials aim to support teachers and early childhood practitioners to nurture the language development of EAL learners. Further guidance about these resources will issue to schools shortly.  </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council is working closely with the Department to assist and prioritise the registration of any Ukrainian nationals who arrive in Ireland and who are teachers. Arrangements to support the registration of Ukrainian teachers by providing a streamlined process and reasonable accommodations are being put in place. A dedicated email address ukrainianteachers@teachingcouncil.ie has been set up and Ukrainian teachers are encouraged to use this to get advice and assistance from the Council.</p></reply>

These guidelines, are available on my Department's web-site at www.gov.ie/en/publication/7e515-technical-guidance-documents. In primary schools, a mainstream classroom of 80m&sup2; in area is provided in the design of new school buildings and extensions to existing buildings. At post primary level, specifications vary with the purpose of the classroom. These guidelines fully comply with all statutory requirements.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom and Special Education Needs (SEN) accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school&rsquo;s existing accommodation.  </p>  <p>  The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics. The second half of the National Development Plan will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.  </p>  <p>  Schools can also avail of funding in respect of their accommodation under the Annual Minor Works Grant or the Summer Works Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account, for example, classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools. </p>  <p>  At primary level, the annual staffing schedule determines the allocation of teachers to schools. The current allocation is on an average ratio of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils.  Budget 2022 has implemented a further 1 point reduction for the 2022/23 school year so that primary schools will be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of 1 classroom teacher for every 24 pupils in September 2022.  Lower thresholds apply to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools.</p>  <p>  This Budget measure has brought the teacher allocation ratio in all primary schools to the lowest ever seen at primary level.  This is the second successive Budget which has seen an improvement in allocation of teachers to primary schools.</p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio shows an improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 16:1 to 14.5:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2020/21 school year.  This compares favourably with the OECD pupil teacher ratio which is 1:15. In the same period the staffing schedule improved from 28:1 to 25:1 for this school year.</p>  <p>  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 23.3 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes for this school year, and statistics on this will be published later in the year.</p></reply>

Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. Topics covered at post-primary include: sexual harassment; healthy and unhealthy relationships; consent; domestic gender-based and sexual violence; dating violence and rape.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to the development of inclusive and age appropriate curricula for RSE and SPHE across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relation.</p>  <p>  Following a review of RSE in schools across all stages of education the NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools.  </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPE/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. These resources cover all topics including many of the topics that have been raised recently as important for young people's education - there are resources to help teachers in teaching about rights and responsibilities in relationships, how to recognise healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationships, how to interact safely and respectfully the influence of the media on young people's understanding and expectations, sexual consent and assertive communication.</p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these and other related topics within the SPHE classroom. The Toolkit provides practical help designed to deepen teachers' understanding and skills so that they feel more confident in addressing important and sensitive topics.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for redeveloping and updating the SPHE curriculum is progressing. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification is due to be agreed at NCCA Council by the summer, with a public consultation to follow when schools return in September. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and rolled out in schools from September 2023. Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow afterwards. </p>  <p>  I have announced a review of the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and procedures on bullying.  This review will take account of developments and relevant research since the action plan and procedures were published and will specifically consider areas such as cyber bullying, gender identity bullying and sexual harassment. </p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published in August 2021.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the Department of Justice in formulating and implementing the Third National Strategy for Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (DSGBV). Proposed actions for my Department include enhancing understanding of gender and relationships, and enabling frontline professionals and support staff, with the assistance of the support services for teachers, to have the necessary analysis, skills, and expertise to identify potential DSGBV dangers and make appropriate preventative interventions. As well as being done through developing and implementing update SPHE and RSE curricula, it will also be achieved by building on continuing professional development (CPD) and anti-bullying procedures. </p>  <p>  The proposed actions are intended to reflect the ambition of my Department to play its part in realising the aim of eradicating domestic, sexual and gender-based violence from society and I look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice in furtherance of this.</p></reply>

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, in consultation with parents, having regard to the ethos of the school.  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary junior cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. My Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines.</p>  <p>  The current SPHE/RSE curriculum at both primary and post primary facilitates teaching and learning about consent. </p>  <p>  At primary level, the Stay Safe Programme is a mandatory part of the SPHE programme. The primary SPHE programme as a whole is also due to be updated by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) as part of the work resulting from the NCCA&rsquo;s review of RSE provision in schools.</p>  <p>  At post primary level, two programmes are in place which come under the heading of Personal Safety. One of these programmes is for Junior Cycle which addresses personal safety in relationships and explores topics such as healthy and unhealthy relationships, consent and domestic gender-based and sexual violence. The other programme, which is for Senior Cycle, addresses topics such as domestic violence, sexual harassment, dating violence and rape. Both of these programmes were designed by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and are intended to be taught as part of the wider SPHE/RSE curriculum. Professional development support is available to teachers, directly linked to these resources. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  In April 2018, the then Minister for Education and Skills asked the NCCA to undertake a major review of RSE in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA in December, 2019.</p>  <p>  The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.</p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools.  </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the work of the NCCA has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE/RSE may be approached in a more holistic way. This work is progressing well and sections of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE JC Short Course and SC SPHE Framework) have now been published.  </p>  <p>  The NCCA online SPHE toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address issues of consent, gender and sexual discrimination and violence, and related topics within the SPHE classroom.  </p>  <p>  In tandem with the development of the online Toolkit, preparation for redeveloping and updating the SPHE curriculum is progressing. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.   A draft revised Junior Cycle specification is due to be agreed at NCCA Council by the summer, with a public consultation to follow when schools return in September. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and rolled out in schools from September 2023. Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow afterwards. </p>  <p>  In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of consent education and naming consent within the learning outcomes for RSE, across all levels, based on the principle that consent is a core dimension of all healthy interpersonal relationships.</p>  <p>  In addition to developing updated curricula and support materials the NCCA will contribute to facilitating interagency collaboration and linkages between the formal and non-formal education sector to enhance the sharing of expertise, learning and resources related to RSE. The NCCA will also initiate networking between groups/agencies working to support schools on targeted initiatives, such as consent and LGBTQI+ issues.</p></reply>

This support was vitally important to ensure that our schools remained open for pupils. I am conscious that, at the same time, so many aspects of the student teacher experience were altered by the pandemic. </p>  <p>  Over the past two years, Education Stakeholders, including the Department of Education, Higher Education Institutions providing initial teacher education (ITE) and the Teaching Council, have sought to work together to maintain the integrity of the students&rsquo; ITE experiences and support students in satisfactorily completing their ITE programmes, while also meeting the challenges to the education system as a whole. In this context, a number of Guidance documents were developed and published, to provide information and clarity around aspects of ITE that were particularly impacted by Covid-19 and to set out the framework within which student teachers could facilitate additional substitute supply, as appropriate to their own circumstances. </p>  <p>  In this regard, a framework for adapted School Placement arrangements was developed by the Department of Education and the Teaching Council, together with the relevant Initial Teacher Education (ITE) providers, in order to ensure that student teachers at primary level could continue to support schools during periods of planned school placement from the beginning of January up to the February mid-term break. During this period, student teachers continued to be located in their host school for school placement, but were also available to support other schools where required. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the adapted School Placement arrangements were an exceptional measure introduced as part of a suite of measures to support schools to minimise the risk associated with COVID-19 in January and February, with the understanding that these would be unwound as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The Department understands that student teachers are now experiencing more typical School Placement arrangements, and associated assessments, which are a critical part of their ITE programmes.  While the adapted School Placement arrangements are no longer in place, student teachers will, if they wish, still be able to support schools by providing substitution cover when they have availability outside of their ITE programme requirements.  However, student teachers cannot be compelled to carry out substitution work and any substitution work carried out would be in a paid capacity. </p>  <p>  Due to the exigencies of the public health emergency still posed by the spread of Covid-19,  I have signed into force legislation which permits payment for periods of more than five consecutive school days to 3rd and 4th year student teachers, who satisfy the criteria to be eligible to apply to the Teaching Council for registration, pursuant to Route 5 of the Schedule to the Teaching Council (Registration) Regulations 2016. </p>  <p>   This is a temporary and time limited amendment to Regulation 7 of the Education Act 1998 (Unregistered Persons) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 32 of 2014) which will expire on 30th June 2022.  This amendment solely relates to this category of unregistered persons and the &ldquo;5-day rule&rdquo; remains in place in relation to the employment of all other unregistered persons in schools.</p>  <p>   In addition, the Teaching Council is working to put processes and procedures in place to support the registration and vetting of 3rd and 4th year student teachers.  This is expected to be in place before the end of this academic year.</p></reply>

There is no longer any need for a student to have a diagnosis of a specific learning difficulty to be eligible.  </p><p>In 2019, the most recent year for which complete data is available, 23,041 reasonable accommodations were granted to 19,795 candidates (16% of the overall cohort) to facilitate their participation in the state examinations.

'Urban' refers to settlements with a population of 1,500 or more, while settlements with a population of less than 1,500 are classified as rural. This CSO classification also takes into account growth in population and the expansion of urban areas over time (urban sprawl), and is considered the most appropriate method of categorising schools as 'urban' or 'rural'. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that, in the context of identification of schools for inclusion in the DEIS programme, the assessed level of concentrated disadvantage of a school's pupil cohort is independent of the school categorisation as 'urban' or 'rural'.</p></reply>

Arising from this review, routes may be altered, extended or withdrawn depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year.  </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the family referred to by the Deputy reside 4.4 km from home to the school they are attending, their nearest school, and are eligible for transport under the terms of the scheme.  I am pleased to advise that the status on Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s system has now been changed to &ldquo;eligible&rdquo;, and that their local office has been in contact with the family referred.  They have also advised that there are seats available on a service that can accommodate these children at present and these seats will be offered to the family once relevant payment has been made. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.</p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway.  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.</p></reply>

The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  The Commission has completed its work and its report was published on 7th October 2021.  The Commission's Report, its Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, and submissions made to the Commission are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard including measures in relation to PRSI base broadening.</p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, this Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  The views of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will be considered as part of the Government&rsquo;s deliberations over the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  My officials are also examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions on any specific recommendations.  In this regard, I will be bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government in April. </p>  <p>  As the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland, the State Pension is very effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension Age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department is working actively with the Department of Housing and the City and County Management Association to extend the supply of buildings with the potential to accommodate refugees. The scale of the accommodation challenge is very significant. However, it is necessary that the owner of the facility offer it as accommodation In regard to the former Dingle hospital, you may be aware that in September 2020, M&oacute;rtas Pobail applied to Kerry County Council to change the use of the former hospital buildings to a mixed-use facility. Following this, in May 2021, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta announced it had secured &euro;415,000 under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund to develop a master plan for the Old Dingle Hospital project. As such, this is a matter for those bodies.</p></reply>

This pilot is one initiative as part of a wide ranging strategy addressing various aspects of the lives of children from birth to age five including supports for parents to balance working and caring, developments in early learning and care and health initiatives.</p>  <p>  The gift of the Baby Box is intended as a welcome from the State for a new arrival to a family and an acknowledgement of this very significant moment for parents. The universal distribution of Baby Boxes also reflects an important equality principle that each child is given something of equal value at the start of their life. The concept of Baby Boxes has been implemented in a number of countries including Scotland, whereby parents receive a package of items to assist with the transition to parenthood. The pilot will undertake research and consultation to determine items for inclusion in the Baby Box, informed by the commitments in the First 5 strategy, and these may include safety items, toys to support early development and books.</p>  <p>  Key objectives with the Baby Box and linked communications will include support for parent-infant bonding, information on baby development and early learning, advice and support for breastfeeding and promotion of infant health and safety.  </p>  <p>  This action was delayed by the reassignment of personnel to the Covid response.  The preparation to advance the initiative is now proceeding with the first meeting of the project advisory group held on December 13.  It is envisaged that the pilot rollout will get underway in quarter 2 of 2022.  A key element of the pilot is the evaluation.  It is hoped the pilot evaluation report will be finalised in Q3 of 2022.  Discussions are underway in agreeing the location or locations of the pilot and a decision will be taken shortly.</p></reply>

The National Youth Assembly of Ireland is now in place to act as a consultative forum on issues such as climate, rural and other important issues, as required. </p>  <p>  The main function of the National Youth Assembly is to provide a systematic means of capturing the voices of young people in Ireland and feed this directly into Government policy, such as the annual revision of the Climate Action Plan and the work programme for Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021-2025.</p>  <p>  By providing a forum in which young people can give their views, the National Youth Assembly of Ireland provides insight into some of the concerns facing young people, and assists Government in acting on the potential solutions that young people propose. </p>  <p>  The Rural Youth Assembly was convened in November 2021 as a precursor to the National Youth Assembly of Ireland. The Minister for Rural and Community Development heard from young Comhairle na n&Oacute;g (Youth Councils) representatives (aged 12 to 17 years) on their experiences and views on rural Ireland. The views of the young people will inform recommendations for future actions under the Our Rural Future work programme.</p>  <p>  Building on  the success of the Rural Assembly event, the National Youth Assembly of Ireland was established.  On 2nd March 2022 I convened, with Minister Ryan, the inaugural National Youth Assembly on Climate. Young delegates at the Assembly made recommendations to Minister Ryan, and these will inform the Climate Action Plan 2022. </p>  <p>  Youth Assembly delegates range in ages from 12 to 24 years and come from all across Ireland. Thirty young people are selected to sit on the National Youth Assembly for a term of 18 months. The sitting delegates are nominated by established youth organisations including Comhairle na n&Oacute;g (Local Youth Councils). When selecting delegates from the young people nominated, the selection panel, which includes officials from my Department , aim to select a broad representation of diverse young people from a range of youth organisations, taking into account geographical spread, urban/rural representation, age, gender and special interests. </p>  <p>  The sitting delegates are joined at each Assembly by up to ten guest delegates who have a special interest in specific topics being addressed (such as climate issues, rural development etc.). Guest delegates are nominated by established organisations that have a particular interest in the issue being addressed by the Assembly and from organisations relevant to seldom heard children and young people.  Where there are more nominations than places available, a lottery system is used to choose delegates within the criteria specified. </p>  <p>  The Youth Assembly will convene up to four times a year, including once as the National Youth Assembly on Climate and once as the Rural Youth Assembly.  The Youth Assembly may also convene at other times on related issues or on other issues as required, with a maximum of four Youth Assemblies being convened in any calendar year. </p>  <p>  The establishment and function of the National Youth Assembly also meets the commitment in the  interim Climate Actions 2021 to  Establish a Youth Climate Council as part of the new National Dialogue on Climate Action engagement model and annual Climate Action Plan consultations, to help support future dialogue with young people.</p>  <p>  Including the voice of children and young people in decisions that affect them also fulfils  Government commitments under Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p></reply>

I am very mindful of the importance to people who were born in Mother and Baby Homes of access to their personal data.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to meeting its obligations as a data controller when dealing with Subject Access Requests (SARs) and is responding on a case by case basis to individuals in accordance with the requirements of GDPR.</p>  <p>  As of 18 March 2022, my Department received 562 SARs relating to the Mother and Baby Homes archive and responded to 480 of these. </p>  <p>  While the archive is largely a digital one, some physical records also transferred to the Department on the dissolution of the Commission.  Individuals were previously advised that where physical records relating to them were retrieved following searches of the records, they would be provided with copies of the records. The physical records continue to be catalogued by the Department&rsquo;s archivist. Searches of the physical records are being conducted as may be appropriate in the circumstances of each request. Records retrieved are provided to individuals as previously advised to them in correspondence relating to their SAR.  </p>  <p>  On 10 March 2022, the Minister for Health signed the new Data Protection Act 2018 (Access Modifications) (Health) Regulations 2022.  These new Regulations replace the existing Data Protection (Access Modification) (Health) Regulations 1989. They remove the mandatory requirement to consult a health practitioner in every case and permit a data controller to exercise his/her discretion to consult in appropriate situations. </p>  <p>  The Regulations will have a particularly positive impact for individuals seeking to access their health data in the Mother and Baby Homes archive as it will no longer be mandatory in all cases to consult the individual&rsquo;s health practitioner before releasing their health data to them. The new Regulations will facilitate access to an individual&rsquo;s health data in a more timely manner. </p>  <p>  Following the making of the new Regulations, my Department is reviewing all SAR responses where health data was previously withheld and is working to provide health data to individuals as quickly as possible. Individuals who are awaiting the release of their health data do not need to take any action at this time and my Department will be in contact with them at an early date. My Department is also working to provide health data under GDPR to those individuals who previously opted to receive their health data under FOI as an interim measure pending the making of the new health Regulations.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s first National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2022, published in November 2019, is the primary policy vehicle to achieve this vision.</p>  <p>  The Strategy pursues objectives under four thematic pillars providing a vision of an Ireland where LGBTI+ people are visible and included, treated equally, healthy and feel safe and supported. With a view to making progress towards these high-level objectives, it contains over 100 actions.</p>  <p>  To offset delays in the strategies implementation due to the public health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I extended its lifetime into 2022.  It will be reviewed as part of the process of developing a successor strategy.</p>  <p>  The LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy arose from the National Youth Strategy, which was published in 2015. This broader youth strategy identified LGBTI+ young people as a specific group to be considered in the context of focused provision for marginalised and disadvantaged young people. Following this, the LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy was published in June 2018. As with the Inclusion strategy, its lifetime was extended into 2021 to off-set delays in its implementation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. A review of the strategy is now underway and the subsequent report will be available in due course.</p></reply>

Under the direction of my Department, Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process with the CCC administering on-the-ground case management assistance. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances. CCC and Pobal have previously engaged with services that were losing access to their current premises and provided assistance to identify alternatives.</p>  <p>  Financial supports, which may also be accessed through the case management process, are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal.  This includes a strand that can support community services with the operational costs associated with a sudden need to move premises. </p>  <p>  While both community (not-for-profit) and private (for-profit) services play a vital role in the sector in providing services in local communities, this financial support is currently available for the community sector. It is unfortunately not possible for the Department to provide direct financial assistance to private (for-profit) childcare services experiencing this particular circumstance at present.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting, however, that past experience of services that unexpectedly lose their premises indicates that locating suitable alternative premises is normally a bigger obstacle than access to finances.  Support to find alternative accommodation is available to all services, both private and community, from their local CCC.</p>  <p>  The CCC should be the first point of contact for any service seeking support; I would therefore urge any ELC or SAC service in difficulty to contact their local CCC as soon as possible if they have not done so already.</p></reply>

The TEC programme closed to new entrants on 14th February 2020 following the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). The  ASCC provided up to one year of afterschool care for primary school children for certain categories of working parents/guardians and parents/guardians on certain employment programmes (not including Community Employment) based on eligibility criteria provided by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>ASCC was available for a once off maximum of 52 weeks and for the final programme year for any new applicants of 2019/2020 this allowance had to be used consecutively. The ASCC ceased operating once all participants registered completed their allotted time on the programme within the 2020/2021 programme year. Therefore there are no longer any children availing of the ASCC.</p><p>The table below which outlines the numbers of children registered with the ASCC programme for the past five programme years. This information was provided by Pobal who act as the scheme administrator for my Department. <table>    <tr>       <th>Programme Call</th>       <th>Number of unique children</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ASCC 2017/18</td>       <td>363 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ASCC 2018/19</td>       <td>228 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ASCC 2019/20</td>       <td>87 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ASCC 2020/21</td>       <td>14 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ASCC 2021/22</td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total</b></td>       <td><b>584*</b></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>* A child might have been registered for ASCC in more than one year.

It changes the existing law on capacity from the status approach of the wardship system to a flexible functional approach, whereby capacity is assessed on an issue and time-specific basis.</p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service (DSS) will operate the progressive provisions of the 2015 Act.  The DSS has responsibility under the Act for establishing and maintaining panels, which includes a panel of Decision-Making Representatives. Decision-Making Representatives will perform certain specified functions under the 2015 Act and the panel will be monitored and maintained by the Decision Support Service.</p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing preparations for the commencement of the 2015 Act, the Decision Support Service has been undertaking a recruitment process to establish the Decision-Making Representatives panel. It is intended that this panel will consist of approximately 125 members and will be geographically spread to cover different parts of the country. Criteria for inclusion on the panel will include the applicant's experience, qualifications, expertise and general suitability. There are also specified mandatory and desirable eligibility requirements attached to the recruitment of panel members, and the Decision Support Service will be providing training to all recruited panel members.</p>  <p>Under the 2015 Act the Decision-Making Representative role will require the making of decisions in relation to both personal welfare, and property and affairs. The Act therefore envisions a diverse panel where a broad range of Decision-Making Representatives will be recruited and that is what my Department and the DSS are working to achieve. However, it must be acknowledged that the systems and procedures the Act will introduce are novel in this jurisdiction and initial panel composition will depend on the initial eligibility and range of applicants and the outcome of associated recruitment processes.</p></reply>

AIM is a programme of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access and meaningfully participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) pre-school programme.  AIM offers tailored, practical supports based on need and does not require a formal diagnosis of disability.  It should be noted that a formal diagnosis of disability does not guarantee additional supports under AIM, as it may be found that existing supports are sufficient to ensure a child&rsquo;s meaningful participation in the ECCE programme. </p>  <p>  The HSE form part of our structures and as lead on 40 Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams (CDNT), we engage from time to time on issues of assessment of need for supports.  The types of supports range from specific equipment and capital grants to assessing appropriate medical supports for children to enable them to attend preschool. Throughout recent weeks and months officials have provided detailed briefing to me on Children's Disability Network Teams and related issues. I have strongly supported and welcomed the significant additional funding provided in this year&rsquo;s budget to the HSE to enhance the development of Children&rsquo;s Network Disability Teams across the country. </p>  <p>  The recently approved and published HSE National Service Plan demonstrates a strong commitment by the HSE to continued improvement in disability services. I very much welcome the recent publication of the Disability Capacity Review which it is hoped will provide a future road map for expansion and improvement of disability services.  </p>  <p>  In addition I meet regularly with Minister Rabbitte on all important areas.</p></reply>

The report investigates the use and prevalence of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), with a specific focus on cases of alleged sexual harassment or discrimination in Ireland and a number of other jurisdictions, including the UK, USA, Canada and Australia.</p>  <p>  The report was undertaken in the context of growing public awareness of the potentially unethical use of NDAs, and the ongoing review of Ireland&rsquo;s Equality Acts. The research was also undertaken in the context of the introduction of a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill designed to regulate the use of NDAs: the Employment Equality (Amendment) (Non-Disclosure Agreements) Bill 2021 (Bill 82 of 2021).</p>  <p>  The report draws together what is known about NDAs in order to provide a resource to policy-makers in their deliberations about any future regulation of their use in the Irish context. Its findings include that, in line with other jurisdictions, NDAs are used in Ireland in a range of contexts. While their inherent secrecy presents a challenge to researchers and policymakers seeking to understand their prevalence and impact, what is known is that: victims of sexual harassment and discrimination often feel isolated as a result of signing an NDA; organisations can use NDAs to silence victims and avoid challenging discriminatory organisational cultures; and, NDAs can prevent patterns of harassment and discrimination being identified and exposed. </p>  <p>  The report includes recommendations on potential methodologies for further research, and an overview of stakeholder perspectives on the optimum legislative response. The report describes how some commentators and practitioners are in favour of the effective prohibition of NDAs in cases of sexual harassment or discrimination, while others favour their regulation, but still see an important role for them in the ethical resolution of disputes and worry about unintended consequences should they be prohibited.</p>  <p>  The full report is available here: www.gov.ie/en/publication/ef5f6-the-prevalence-and-use-of-non-disclosure-agreements-ndas-in-discrimination-and-sexual-harassment-disputes/.</p></reply>

On 14th March 2022, I published his report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations.</p>  <p>  In reflecting on these recommendations, I am pleased to confirm that the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 can and will robustly fulfil the vast majority of the recommendations.  In particular, it will provide for access to records; access to counselling and related supports; access to a statutory tracing service, including genealogy expertise and facilitated contact with family; an accurate birth registration; official recognition of the identity by which a person has lived; a specialist tracing service; and safeguarding of records.  In addition, I am happy to move forward on recommendation 16 regarding a payment towards legal costs associated with, for example, a declaration of parentage, and have announced a once-off payment of &euro;3,000 to the individuals affected by confirmed illegal birth registration in the files of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Guild.</p></reply>

However, today the safeguards in the adoption acts ensure that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration in all adoption cases.  </p>  <p>  Following Tusla's discovery in early 2018 of evidence of illegal birth registrations in the files of the St. Patrick's Guild adoption society, the Government instructed Tusla to inform the affected individuals.  Some of these cases involved persons living in other countries.  </p>  <p>  In March 2021 I asked Professor Conor O'Mahony, the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, to consider the significant complexities and challenges which arise in relation to the issue of illegal birth registrations, and to provide a report proposing an appropriate course of action. On 14th March 2022 I published the report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations.</p>  <p>  Recommendations 8-12 relate to creating a Specialist Tracing Service that would take a two-pronged approach to identifying further cases of illegal birth registration. Firstly, it recommends a review and trace of the files flagged by Tusla as raising suspicions of illegal birth registration, but which fell short of the amount of evidence in the St. Patrick Guild files during the Independent Review. Secondly, it recommends creating a right of expedited review for persons who hold reasonable suspicions that they may have been the subject of an illegal birth registration.</p>  <p>  On the first point, I will request Tusla to review these files to see if illegal birth registrations can be confirmed. Where they can be, I will direct Tusla to inform the affected individual in an ethical and sensitive manner. I will provide the relevant legal underpinning for this review through the Birth Information and Tracing Bill and prior to issuing a formal request to Tusla.  </p>  <p>  On the second point, through the Birth Information and Tracing legislation, a person who suspects that their birth was illegally registered will have the right to request an expedited review of their case.  </p>  <p>  In the coming months, my priority will be to deliver the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, which will robustly fulfil the vast majority of the report's recommendations and ensure significant support for people affected by an illegal birth registration.</p></reply>

Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website.  If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) should be alerted without delay. </p>  <p>  Tusla acts urgently on notification of an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk may initially be dealt with by AGS or by Tusla, but in the main both agencies work together in such cases. Referrals to Tusla increased by 8% in 2021.</p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have specific powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act to remove a child from a situation of danger, and under Section 13 of that same act, to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla. Tusla will at that point carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. This may in some cases include applying for an Emergency Care Order.  In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm. Where a child is already in care, Tusla will make a determination as to whether the child is safe in their placement or if they need to be moved.</p>  <p>  Tusla has a dedicated social work team for Separated Children Seeking International Protection (SCSIP). Over the past 20 years the SCSIP Team has developed expertise through Ireland's participation in International Refugee Protection Programmes and by caring for separated children seeking international protection who arrive unannounced at Irish ports and airports.</p>  <p>  SCSIP who arrive at ports of entry to Ireland are referred to Tusla for a child protection needs assessment. In the first instance, Tusla makes every attempt to contact relatives of the child and to reunite the child with family members or friends. If children cannot be reunified with family or friends, they are received into the care of Tusla. </p>  <p>  These children are placed by Tusla either in small specialist residential care centres, or with specifically recruited foster families under a F&aacute;ilte Foster care programme. The children are automatically entitled as children in care to a medical card and access to education services. In addition, a Social Worker is allocated to them to develop a care plan and monitor the progress of the child/young persons care. The care plan may involve specialist English language tuition, intensive educational supports and therapeutic work in respect of trauma. </p>  <p>  The basis for care of a SCSIP is different from the general child in care population as they are received into care  for protection and welfare reasons due to their separation from their primary carers, which can be as a consequence of war or persecution.  Children who arrive in Ireland outside of a dedicated refugee programme are supported in their application for refugee status. </p>  <p>  Assisting children with reunification with their families has evolved to be a key piece of the support social workers provide to those who are eligible to apply.  Where relevant the process of reunification is started as soon as the young people come to the attention of Tusla. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Government launched a public awareness campaign on domestic abuse during COVID-19 with a new website stillhere.ie. The campaign was developed by the Department of Justice in collaboration with frontline services including Women's Aid, Safe Ireland, Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Rape Crisis Network Ireland, National Women's Council of Ireland and Men's Development Network. The campaign sought to reassure victims that services are 'still here', and that victims are being prioritised. The website stillhere.ie has details of support services, including recourse to AGS, for anyone at risk or experiencing domestic abuse in their home. </p></reply>

Details of the new measure have been published on the Department of Justice's Irish immigration website - www.irishimmigration.ie. </p>  <p>  Added to that, the Department of Social Protection officials at the points of entry provide PPSNs which enable those arriving to access all the services that our country can offer.</p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has a significant role, as part of the State's overall response, to support children and families displaced from Ukraine, as a result of the war and coming into Ireland.

Tulsa has been advised that 88% of all Ukrainians are arriving in Ireland through Dublin Airport and has  a Social Worker present at Dublin Airport providing a duty service from 10am until 2am the following day.

The public sector duty assessment and implementation for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth was published in 2021 and the Department will continue to report on developments relating to the implementation of the Duty in its Annual Report.</p>  <p>  Discrimination on specified grounds is prohibited by law in the field of employment under the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2021 and in the supply of and access to goods and services under the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2018. Complaints regarding breaches of equality legislation may be pursued before the Workplace Relations Commission. The Workplace Relations Commission publishes statistics regularly on its decisions in regard to equality complaints, disaggregated by discriminatory ground.</p>  <p>  I am conducting a review of the Equality Acts to examine, among other issues, the functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combatting discrimination and promoting equality. This exercise includes a public consultation during 2021 which remained open for contributions until December 2021 and these submissions are now being examined.  The review will also look at the degree to which the legislation is effective in ensuring equal access to services.</p>  <p>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which is independent in the exercise of its statutory functions, includes among those functions keeping under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and equality, including in relation to the provision of goods and services.</p></reply>

Both are coordinated by my Department and constitute a strategic policy and action framework for acting on disability issues, in consultation and collaboration with people with disabilities, other disability experts, family members, disability organisations and disabled persons organisations. </p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017-2022 includes measures to support people with disabilities in all aspects of their lives. The Comprehensive Employment Strategy is focused on providing equal opportunities for access to fair employment and retention of employment. </p>  <p>  The NDIS is a key framework for policy and action to address the needs of persons with disabilities in Ireland. The Steering Group drives and monitors progress across the Strategy and is chaired by Minister of State for Disability Anne Rabbitte T.D. and includes representatives of several Government Departments and Agencies and the Disability Stakeholder Group (DSG).  </p>  <p>  The NDIS specifically supports effective progress in delivering on the obligations set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), where Government's policy is one of progressive realisation, each year moving forward on key reforms, with the obligations arising from the Convention being met over time. Initial priority has been given to meeting legislative commitments. </p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024 (CES) is the primary disability employment policy initiative in Ireland. The CES's strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide co-ordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent chairperson, Mr Fergus Finlay. Currently the group is developing a final Action Plan for the period 2022 &ndash; 2024. </p>  <p>  Both of these strategies provide an ongoing, coordinated and holistic platform for addressing issues affecting persons with disabilities whether in relation to access to jobs, housing or social services, with actions in each Strategy targeted at these and other areas of significance. Both I and my colleagues in Government are committed to continuing to drive progress under the Strategies.</p></reply>

It is a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to employment of all persons with disabilities. The CES's strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide co-ordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers. Each Department is responsible for delivering and implementing the actions assigned to it to achieve the strategic priorities and for reporting on those to the CES Implementation Group. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent chairperson, Mr Fergus Finlay. </p>  <p>  Currently the group is developing a final Action Plan for the period 2022 &ndash; 2024. The Phase III Action Plan will focus on driving progress across those areas that will have the greatest impact for people with disabilities. I look forward to seeing the finalised Plan in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Some key progress to date includes a range of calibrated supports for jobseekers and employers in taking on employees with disabilities provided by the Department of Social Protection, measures to improve access to and uptake of further and higher education, the ability to defer day places for school leavers with disabilities to allow pursuit of continuing education or employment, the funding and development of the Employers for Change Service which provides advice and guidance to employers in becoming "disability confident", and initiatives like the "Towards Work" programme.</p>  <p>  Recognising the lead role of the Public Service in this area, I will also introduce legislation in the coming weeks to double the target number of people with disabilities employed in the public sector from 3% to 6% via the forthcoming Assisted Decision-Making Capacity (Amendment) Bill.</p></reply>

Safe practice is defined as the implementation of appropriate safeguarding measures necessary for working with young people in a manner that acknowledges their need to live in as normal an environment as possible. All children have the right to be cared for, fulfil their potential and be protected from harm.</p>  <p>  Once a child has been received into care, the most crucial task for the social worker is to find a placement that matches that child's needs. Children, depending on their identified need, may be placed in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care, special care or other placement types. A key part of the social worker role is to develop, in consultation with the child and relevant others, a care plan which will guide the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits. There are safeguards surrounding each child's care placement, whether foster or residential care, and all placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.</p>  <p>  Regulations govern the placement of children in care.  These provide for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions. The Regulations also provide that the allocated social worker oversees the implementation of the child's  care plan, visits the child and consults with family members, foster carers and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal.</p>  <p>  HIQA carries out announced and unannounced inspections of children's services including Child Protection and Welfare Services, Foster Care Services, statutory Children's Residential Centres and Special Care units. HIQA carry out these inspections against Regulations and Standards, by reviewing files on site, interviews and questionnaires with staff and service users and their families. Following an inspection, HIQA share their initial judgements and draft report with the service/area. HIQA then works with the management of the centre or area in order to agree an Action Plan to address any identified deficits. Final reports are published, and are submitted to the Department with the area or service's Action Plans and are monitored as necessary by DCEDIY officials.</p>  <p>  Tusla has policies and procedures for responding to concerns, allegations and complaints made by or on behalf of children in care.  This includes ensuring all allegations, concerns, and complaints by children in care are taken seriously and receive the required response as stated in policies within Tusla.  In addition, the Ombudsman for Children and Tusla's own National Review Panel will report on specific topics relating to the work of Tusla which prompts further improvements in Tusla services.</p>  <p>  The foregoing sets out the safeguards in place with regard to all placements of children in care. Tusla in discharging its statutory responsibilities under the Child Care Acts must have the best interests of the child as its paramount consideration. It actively monitors every placement of every child in care to ensure its appropriateness to the needs of that child, and any concerns or breaches of standards are addressed in this context.</p></reply>

The Strategy provides a framework for a range of actions to support migrants to participate fully in Irish life. While initially due to conclude in 2020, the Migrant Integration Strategy was extended to the end of 2021 in recognition of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation. </p>  <p>  My Department has commissioned a study to evaluate the processes for implementation of three equality strategies, which includes the Migrant Integration Strategy as well as the National Strategy for Women and Girls and the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy. I anticipate that a consultation process to develop a new strategic policy for migrant integration will commence during 2022, with work to build the new Strategy taking place in 2023.</p>  <p>  As part of its actions under the Migrant Integration Strategy, my Department administers a number of funding programmes to support integration at both national and local level.</p>  <p>  One such initiative is the National Integration Fund, a three-year funding programme to promote projects that address areas where migrants find it difficult to avail of opportunities on an equal basis with other members of Irish society. Following a competitive funding call launched in August 2020, 18 successful projects located throughout Ireland were granted funding totalling almost &euro;2.2 million over the three year period. This funding will support national organisations and larger-scale initiatives to empower new members of Irish society to play an active part in their communities.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Communities Integration Fund, which has been in place since 2017, provides small grants of up to &euro;5,000 to community organisations for initiatives to promote integration at local level. Since its inception, the Communities Integration Fund has supported over 490 projects with grant funding totalling &euro;2.76m. A further funding call was launched in early March this year and closes for applications on 6 April.</p></reply>

It is also available to families with children over 3 years who have not yet qualified for the free preschool (ECCE) programme. </p><p>- The <b>Income Assessed Subsidy</b>is available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years. It is means tested and will be calculated based on individual circumstances. Those on the lowest incomes will receive the highest subsidies. </p><p>As part of the monitoring, review and evaluation of the NCS, Frontier Economics was commissioned to undertake a formal review of the first year of the NCS, with the report published in December 2021. The report noted that childcare costs in Ireland have been found to be a significant factor in contributing to low levels of participation in employment, education and training for mothers, particularly for lone parents. The NCS was designed to make childcare more affordable and, in some instances, free.</p><p>As part of Budget 2022, I announced a number of changes to the NCS, which will be of significant benefit to many parents. These changes will result in more parents getting additional subsidised hours for early learning and childcare in Tusla registered services by extending the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 - benefitting up to 40,000 children.</p><p>A further change will remove the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children.</p><p>In addition,  I would note the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, mentioned above, is a universal programme available to all children within the eligible age range. The programme is provided for three hours per day, five days per week over 38 weeks, and the programme year runs from September to June. A child must have turned 2 years and 8 months on or before the 31st August of a given programme year in order to be eligible (and cannot turn 5 years and 6 months during the programme year).</p><p>Furthermore, from September 2022, a major new Core Funding stream will be introduced. Under Core Funding providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase.  The commitment not to increase fees will ensure that the full affordability benefits of the ECCE programme and the NCS are felt by parents.</p><p>My Department will continue to keep these schemes under review to ensure they meet their objectives and are in line with international best practice. In this regard, I would note a 12 month review of ECCE will commence this year which will involve an international comparison and the three year review of the NCS will commence at the end of 2022.</p></reply>

Since the start of the 2020/2021 academic year, my Department has worked with the HEA Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and the sectoral representative bodies to ensure the national, sectoral and local roll out of: </p><p>- Online consent training for all incoming students; </p><p>- Online bystander intervention training for all incoming students; </p><p>- An Anonymous Report and Support Tool for issues of bullying, harassment, and sexual harassment. </p><p>HEIs were requested to consider making consent classes mandatory for incoming students from the 2020/21 academic year. In practice it has not been possible to ensure all students take these classes, however all HEIs offer consent or bystander intervention programming as part of induction for new students.

The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) provides funding to eligible further and higher education institutions to assist them in offering supports and services to eligible students with disabilities so that they can participate on an equal basis with their peers.  The FSD aims to support the personal, educational and professional development of the participating student and contribute to the achievement of their full potential. </p>  <p>  Funding can be used to provide supports and accommodations in any of the following broad categories: assistive technology equipment and software (including student training); non-medical helpers (e.g. personal assistants, note takers); academic/learning support; deaf supports (e.g. sign language interpreters, Speed Text); and transport support Eligible institutions receive block grant funding in respect of the FSD for a full calendar year. The disability support staff in each institution completes a needs assessment in respect of each student. On completion of the needs assessment, appropriate accommodations are then put in place to support the students&rsquo; journey through their chosen course. The nature and cost of the supports provided to each student varies depending on the particular needs of each student. As such, it is not possible to provide an estimated cost per student. </p>  <p>  A range of other supports are also available to students. As part of our Covid response, my Department allocated &euro;15 million to higher and further education providers for a grant to support disadvantaged students in accessing ICT devices. This initiative enabled a bulk purchase by HEAnet of approximately 16,500 Dell devices on behalf of further and higher education institutions. The key objective of this initiative was to address concerns regarding the digital divide in the context of the shift to online and blended models of learning. This initiative allows for the redistribution of laptops when returned by students. The latest data available for the end of 2021, has confirmed that a total of 21,581 laptops were procured which supports 24,683 students. The Devolved Capital Grant which is issued annually to the HEIs also allows for the purchase of ICT equipment at the discretion of the HEI to address the digital divide for disadvantaged students. </p>  <p>  Work on the development of the new National Access Plan which will cover the 2022-2026 period, is at an advanced stage. Officials in my Department are working closely with the Higher Education Authority and relevant Government Departments on finalising the content of the plan, including a range of key goals and actions.  The plan is expected to be published in the first half of 2022.</p></reply>

The Model will increase community engagement and access to a wider range of specialist services across the country.  It development and design flow from recommendations made by both the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, implementation of the Operating Model is in an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  Each of the 19 Divisions under the new Model will be comprised of four Functional Areas: Community Engagement, Crime, Performance Assurance and Business Services.  Implementation of the Model has initially focused on the Business Services Functional Area.  To date, 17 out of the 19 Divisions have commenced the phased implementation of Business Services.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Operating Model Central Implementation Team conduct ongoing reviews of the Model. Evaluations are conducted monthly with Divisions who have commenced implementation to assess progress and the adoption of the new ways of working. Feedback is actively tracked and reviewed by the Model Central Implementation Team, and this will continue throughout the rollout of all phases and functions of the model. </p></reply>

Of these, 44 applications were approved for 119 beneficiaries, with 40 applications refused in respect of 188 beneficiaries because they did not meet the criteria for the Programme. </p>  <p>  SHAP immigration stamps were issued to 79 people who took up their SHAP immigration permissions and travelled to Ireland between 2014 and January 2017. In 2021, SHAP immigration permissions were renewed in respect of 12 beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  Between 2011 and the end of February 2022, a total of 1,406 Syrian nationals were granted international protection under the Refugee Act 1996 (up to 2016) and the International Protection Act 2015 (from 2017). </p>  <p>  Prior to the transfer of responsibility for the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) from my Department to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on 14 October 2020, a total of 3,358 people were relocated and resettled to Ireland, the vast majority of which were Syrian nationals. </p>  <p>  Additionally, Syrian nationals legally resident in Ireland on another immigration permission, for example as students or people with employment permits, may apply for an extension of their permission to remain in the State while the crisis situation in Syria continues. </p></reply>

Combatting it is, and will continue to be, a priority for me and for this Government.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has committed significant resources to the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking in Ireland. A specialised Garda Unit, the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU), has been in place since 2009 to conduct investigations into human trafficking. It also provides advice, support and where necessary, operational assistance to investigations at district level. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also active in relation to trafficking gangs through work targeting organised crime &ndash; this includes targeting their finances and their use of the internet and by Garda&iacute; working closely with other jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that this Government is serious about preventing and prosecuting for human trafficking, and committed to supporting those that are victims of it. We are confident that the victim-centred policy approach we are taking will encourage more victims to come forward and access supports and that this will, in turn, strengthen prosecutions and convictions.</p>  <p>  Last year Government approved proposals to revise the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) to make it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, be identified and access advice, accommodation and support.</p>  <p>  The revised NRM will provide for all agencies, both State and civil society, to co-operate, share information about potential victims, identify those victims and facilitate their access to advice, accommodation and support.</p>  <p>  The new approach acknowledges various state bodies and NGOs have a role in identifying victims of human trafficking and referring them to the NRM.</p>  <p>  We want to be sure that every victim of trafficking is identified and helped so we can support them. Doing this will also help us gather more information and evidence in order to bring to justice the traffickers who prey on vulnerable people with no regard for the lives and safety of their victims.</p>  <p>  In addition, the development of a new National Action Plan on human trafficking is also taking place. A consultant has produced a short and focused analysis of the current position in relation to human trafficking in Ireland. The analysis includes a research review, a synopsis of the extent of trafficking in Ireland and a summary of issues to address.</p>  <p>  Following that analysis, the Department of Justice is now engaged with a working group to draft a new National Action Plan. Officials will be engaging with Civil Society representatives in the coming weeks with a view to finalising the plan to submit to Government after the Easter recess.</p></reply>

It allows those engaged in prostitution to provide information to Garda&iacute;, for instance if they were subjected to violence by clients, without fear of prosecution for selling sexual services. </p>  <p>  Section 27 of the 2017 Act provides for a review of Part 4 of the Act three years after it is commenced. In the context of the goal of the legislation, which is to protect vulnerable persons, the review will include consideration of whether further measures are needed to strengthen protection for persons who engage in sexual activity for payment.</p>  <p>  The review of Part 4 is being carried out by an independent expert and is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are also working on a legislative amendment to expunge previous convictions for &lsquo;sale of sex&rsquo;, or prostitution offences. This is a significant step in recognising and responding to the needs of victims of sex trafficking, and those forced to provide sexual services, which will include people trafficked into Ireland for that purpose.</p>  <p>  Given the link between trafficking and prostitution, I would like to also assure you that the Government is fully committed to addressing human trafficking in all forms under Irish and EU legislation and the principal international conventions.</p>  <p>  The Second National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Human Trafficking involves a victim-centred and human rights based approach with the ultimate aims of preventing human trafficking, ensuring an effective criminal justice response and delivery of supports to victims.</p>  <p>  In that regard, my Department provides funding to several non-governmental organisations for their work to provide support to victims of trafficking.</p>  <p>  Separately, last year the Government approved plans to revise the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) to make it easier for victims of human trafficking to come forward, be identified, and facilitate their access to advice, accommodation and support.</p>  <p>  Currently, when suspected victims of human trafficking are encountered by, or referred to, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they are provided with a wide range of services by both the Government and NGOs through the NRM. The new approach acknowledges that other state bodies and NGOs have a role in identifying victims of human trafficking and referring them to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  Action is also being taken to raise public awareness in Ireland and help members of the public identify the signs of human trafficking. More information is available on www.blueblindfold.gov.ie, a website maintained by my Department.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last year formally established the Organised Prostitution Unit, attached to the Garda National Protective Services Bureau. The establishment of this specialised unit reinforces the service's commitment to protecting vulnerable persons, including victims of human trafficking involved in prostitution here.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also continues to commit significant resources to the investigation of human trafficking and organised prostitution, and to supporting vulnerable victims including those who have been victims of trafficking.  A specialised Garda Unit, the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU), has been established to coordinate delivery of the national strategy. </p></reply>

The act provides a comprehensive definition of the term &lsquo;intimate image&rsquo; and the penalties include a term of imprisonment of up to seven years on conviction on indictment.</p>  <p>  Section 3 makes it an offence to record, distribute or publish an intimate image without consent even if there was no intent to cause harm. This summary offence provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of 12 months. </p>  <p>  In section 4 distributing, publishing or sending a threatening or grossly offensive communication is made an indictable offence with a maximum term of imprisonment of two years.  It also provides for once-off harmful communication to or about another person without the need for persistence of offending.</p>  <p>  Coco's Law amends and updates the definition of &lsquo;harassment&rsquo; introduced in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 to reflect and include the cyber or online environment.  It also increases the penalties for the offence of harassment, notably to 10 years for conviction on indictment as well as providing for increased fines.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has to date, commenced 28 prosecutions by way of charges and summonses, relating to 19 separate investigations under the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020. </p>  <p>  We need to make sure that people are aware of the harm caused to victims and of the potential penalties applicable if a person is tried and convicted of engaging in this unacceptable behaviour.</p>  <p>  On 2 September 2021, my Department with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, established a partnership with Hotline.ie to create an online reporting facility. This enables victims of intimate image abuse (IIA) to report it to Hotline.ie and request the assistance of Hotline.ie who will engage with the relevant service provider to seek the removal of the illegal content reported. At the same time, if a victim requests, Hotline.ie will pass all relevant information to the Garda&iacute; so that a thorough criminal investigation can be conducted with a view to prosecuting offenders. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that during the period 2 September 2021 to 23 March 2022, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na received 39 reports from Hotline.ie.  Following the removal of the reported links by Hotline.ie and further engagement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 16 cases have been closed with no further action requested and 23 remain under assessment / investigation.</p></reply>

The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  This payment will be made to those eligible public sector frontline healthcare staff (inclusive of agency staff working for the HSE) who worked in clinical settings, noting this list is not exhaustive: those Doctors / Nurses / Health Care Assistants / Porters / Cleaners etc. that work in clinical settings. The measure encompasses Health Care Support Assistants (also known as Home Carers / Home Help) employed by or carrying out duties contracted to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The measure also encompasses those eligible working on site in long term residential care facilities for people with disabilities (inclusive of those facilities whether HSE or section 39). The measure further extends to those equivalent healthcare workers in private nursing homes and hospices. Arrangements for this sector encompassed by this measure are currently being progressed by the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health appreciates the levels of interest this announcement has generated. We are working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, particulars and terms and conditions that apply. Additionally, the Department and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions on this matter. This consultation is part of the Department and HSE&rsquo;s objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly.</p>  <p>  Upon conclusion of consultations with the trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars shall be published by the HSE. Noting that the details will be finalised once this consultation has concluded, it would be inappropriate to comment any further at this point.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy regarding the number of persons on the outpatient waiting list with an address in counties Roscommon and Galway is outlined in the attached document and was provided to my department by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).</p></reply>

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  In relation to the regulatory framework, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for homecare and support providers in April 2021.  The framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis will be undertaken by the Department in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.</p>  <p>  The regulations being drawn up by the Department and the standards being drafted by the HIQA both take cognisance of the diverse and often complex needs of those who require homecare and support. The aim is to ensure that service-users are safe-guarded and protected, and a responsive, person-centred, quality-driven home-support service is provided. This is central to the Sl&aacute;intecare objective of providing &lsquo;right care, in the right place at the right time&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The development of regulations and quality standards are at an advanced level. HIQA ran a public scoping consultation in September to inform the development of National Standards for Home Support Services. HIQA has convened an Advisory Group, with representation from the Department of Health, to assist in the process of developing the Draft National Standards.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department developed draft regulations and a targeted stakeholder consultation was undertaken in January 2022. Evaluating the feedback of this consultation is informing amendments in the draft regulations in advance of a public consultation planned in Q2 2022.</p></reply>

As such I have held multiple meetings with relevant key stakeholders in recent months on these matters.  </p>  <p>  I have also spoken about my commitment in establishing a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group to examine strategic workforce challenges, including recruitment and retention of workers, in front-line carer roles in home support and nursing homes.  This Group is now fully established and I opened the inaugural meeting on 3rd March 2022 and expressed my full support. </p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference for the Group are available on the Department&rsquo;s website: </p>  <p>gov.ie - Minister for Mental Health and Older People Mary Butler launches the first meeting of the Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group on Home Carers and Nursing Home Health Care Assistants (www.gov.ie)  </p>  <p>  The Group will progress a structured programme of ongoing consultative engagements with stakeholders to further explore and define the issues, listen to stakeholder views, and identify approaches to respond to the strategic workforce challenges including the recruitment of staff.</p>  <p>  The Group will also provide a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address the workforce challenges in the sector and develop a report for my consideration outlining the Group&rsquo;s key findings, recommendations, and a proposed action plan to support implementation of these recommendations to include periodic monitoring of progress.</p>  <p>  The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations to me by September 2022.</p>  <p>  That said, it is important to note that progress is being made in terms of reducing the waiting lists - at the end of January 2022 there were 4,836 people assessed and waiting for a carer to become available. This is a reduction from December 2021, when 5,322 were waiting for a carer to become available. At the end of January 274 were awaiting processing of funding approval, which is a reduction from 474 in December 2021. Furthermore, the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to approximately 5,110 by the end of January 2022.</p></reply>

For the duration of the Covid-19 public health emergency, where the need for social distancing, reducing personal contacts and reducing the burden on medical practitioners are paramount, it became possible for a woman to access a termination under section 12 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 (i.e., before 12 weeks) from her medical practitioner by telephone or video conference consultation.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to monitor service provision, facilitate the smooth-running of the service and resolve any issues that may arise. However, with restrictions eased, the Department is currently reviewing whether remote consultation as part of a blended approach to termination of pregnancy care should be continued post the COVID-19 public health emergency period. </p>  <p>  At the request of the Department, the HSE conducted a review of the Revised Model of Care for Termination of Pregnancy. The findings of this review are currently being examined.</p>  <p>  It is important to reflect that COVID-19 is still with us and Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) guidance on Managing Risk of Transmission of Respiratory Viruses including COVID-19, continues to advise, amongst other things, to limit footfall in General Practice settings and support telephone consultations where care that meets the needs of the patient can be delivered - this helps to eliminate the risk of transmission of viral infection. As such the arrangements for remote access to this service in the context of COVID-19 remain in place.</p></reply>

Following the last meeting of the NPHET, and on the basis of the advice I received from the CMO, the Government removed the mandatory element of mask wearing in areas where it was regulated. </p>  <p>  The NPHET advice, that was accepted by Government, clearly stated that while the mandatory element of mask wearing had been removed, there was no change to the public health advice in relation to the continued wearing of masks, practising of physical distancing and avoidance of crowded environments based on individual risk assessment and with a continuing focus on protecting others, and adherence to basic hand and respiratory hygiene. </p>  <p>  The wearing of masks is also advised on public transport. This is a setting where physical distancing can be difficult and where those who are more vulnerable to the severe impacts of COVID-19 do not always have a discretion to avoid. For these reasons, the NPHET recommended that the wearing of masks on public transport should continue to be advised. The continuation of mask wearing in healthcare settings is also advised. </p>  <p>  These messages, along with the important message to stay home if you have symptoms, are being carried on my Department and HSE social media channels, so as to remind people of the current public health advice.</p></reply>

Firstly, I would acknowledge that the safety concerns around the misuse of non-prescription medicinal products containing codeine are well established and this is an important medication safety issue. Codeine containing medicines should only be used when considered necessary and for the shortest period necessary. I would empathise with any individual patient of family impacted by the illness of addiction. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query, there are currently a number of controls in place addressing the supply of prescription exempt medicinal products containing codeine. This group of products may only be supplied from a pharmacy under the personal supervision of a pharmacist. The pharmacist has a legislative obligation to be satisfied when supplying such products that the appropriate product is being sought and that the patient/purchaser is aware of the appropriate use of the medicinal product, the medicinal product is being sought for that purpose and the medicinal product is not intended for abuse and/or misuse.  This obligation applies also when the product is being supplied through an online interaction and the pharmacist must personally review every online order. </p>  <p>  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland regulates the practice of pharmacists and the operation of pharmacies in Ireland. It has been overseeing this issue since late 2009 when it first introduced particular guidance relating to the supply of these products and routinely monitors the adherence of pharmacists and pharmacies to the controls in place.    </p></reply>

The then Minister amended the Mackerel policy in July 2017 after intensive review and public consultation, however this particular amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery.  </p>  <p>  In order to amend Mackerel Policy, I must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect of a policy, it would require due process, involving an assessment of all issues arising, including a full public consultation.  </p>  <p>  There has been, for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota to the UK by 2026.  This will only increase demands for a higher share of Ireland&rsquo;s Mackerel quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet. The Deputy should be aware that the 400 tonne limit for the hook and line fishery has not been reduced and has remained the same as in previous years.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the situation is that if there is an increase in the Mackerel quota for any sector in the allocation made available, such as for the hook and line fishery, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the TCA.  </p>  <p>  The management arrangements, within the policy, for the Hook and Line fishery has been on the agenda and discussed with Industry representatives at recent meetings of the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC). It is important to note  that the remit of the QMAC is to examine and make recommendations within Ministerial Policy. I have asked the QMAC to examine measures to strengthen the management arrangements for the 2022 mackerel hook and line fishery, within the policy, for my consideration.</p></reply>

This is to ensure the person receiving the scheme payments is the person farming the land being claimed.</p>  <p>  Under the CAP Strategic Plan Regulation, Active farmers are defined as those &ldquo;engaged in at least a minimum level of agricultural activity&rdquo;. It is proposed that the minimum level of agricultural activity will be based on the minimum stocking rate requirement for grassland farms. </p>  <p>  The Department will check existing databases such as the Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) system, and the sheep and goat census.  It is proposed that the minimum stocking requirement would be set at 0.10 Livestock Unit per hectare (LU/Ha), based on the new Eurostat coefficients.  The new proposed minimum stocking rate of 0.10 LU/Ha maintains the link with 1 Ewe per hectare (1 Ewe = 0.10 LU) as it is in the current CAP. Farmers who meet the minimum stocking level required will be deemed to be active for the purposes of the "active farmer check".</p>  <p>  For tillage farmers, it is proposed that the Department may look for evidence of the purchase of seed, fertiliser, plant protection products, etc.  Farmers who do not have either livestock or crops will be asked to indicate on their application how they exercise an agricultural activity - for example, topping, or by selling hay or silage, or if they plan to purchase livestock in 2023.</p></reply>

Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine has led to significant hikes in energy prices and significant concerns around supply chain disruption.</p>  <p>  I raised concerns in relation to the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on agri-food supply chains, and especially on input costs at the extraordinary informal meeting of European Union Agriculture Ministers held on 2nd March.  I underlined the need for market support and the need to maintain supply chains and to ensure an effective and functioning Single Market. Commissioner Wojciechowski is aware of concerns and is considering the issue of necessary supports under the CMO Regulation.</p>  <p>  At the AgriFish Council of 21 March, I asked the EU Commission, as part of its work on monitoring markets, to keep a very close eye on the issue of fertiliser availability across the EU and to be ready to consider any measures that may help to alleviate the difficulties caused. The EU Commission is considering bringing in a private storage aid scheme for the pigmeat sector, as well as allowing other exceptional measures at Member Sate level to respond to market disturbances. </p>  <p>  I launched the 2022 Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign at Teagasc&rsquo;s Ballyhaise College on 26th January in response to the unprecedented fertiliser price levels.  This is a credible roadmap that will help alleviate the short term price pressure while helping farmers reduce their dependency on chemical fertiliser in the longer-term. Teagasc has also recently issued revised advice to farmers on the recommended application amounts of fertilisers for silage fields to reflect the increase in fertilisers.</p>  <p>  At a meeting of farm organisations on 8th March, I established a National Fodder and Food Security Committee to explore all options to minimise the impact on farms and plan in the short to medium term. This Group continues to meet and it is expected that its outcomes will be presented shortly.</p>  <p>  Given Ireland&rsquo;s dependence on imported feed, I have announced a &euro;12 million support package to encourage Irish tillage farmers to grow more crops. This targeted measure is to support the production of more native crops and also crops with a lower demand for chemical fertiliser.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to closely monitor the evolving situation and is actively engaging with the fertiliser industry to evaluate stock levels and availability and assist in ensuring the ongoing continuity of supply.</p></reply>

The distribution of catches ranges from the north of the Norwegian Sea to the south coast of Portugal and Spain. Mackerel is targeted by a number of fleets throughout the year with large catches in northern waters during summer and the northern North Sea and to the west of Scotland and Ireland during the spawning migration in the winter months </p>  <p>  The Total Allowable Catches (TAC) for the stock has been divided into a North Sea TAC (EU, UK and Norway), a Western TAC (EU, UK, Norway and Faroes), a Southern TAC (EU) and a North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission TAC (Coastal Sates, Iceland and Russia).  Ireland's mackerel quota is mainly from the Western stock area.</p>  <p>  Under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), EU Member State quotas are made available by specified stock area , and not by Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).   Generally most stock areas straddle more than one EEZ area. The Western mackerel TAC, where Ireland has a large quota share, covers ICES area 6, 7, 8a, 8b, 8d and 8e, United Kingdom and International waters of 5b, and international waters of 2a, 12 and 14.   This covers a large area including certain Member States' and third countries' EEZs and international waters. Under the CFP, EU fishing fleets are, as a general principle, given equal access to EU waters and fishing grounds subject to allocated fish quotas.  Irish fishing vessels fish across this extended area of Western waters for mackerel.</p></reply>

These measures are VAT inclusive, costing an estimated &euro;320m, and will last until 31 August 2022. Following these reductions, the overall excise rate for green diesel is some 12 cent per litre versus 41 cent per litre for auto diesel (on a VAT exclusive basis). </p>  <p>  Regarding that 12 cent per litre, farmers continue to be eligible for a double income tax relief, which compensates for increases in the carbon tax element from the 2012 base rate of &euro;15 per tonne of CO2 emissions. Section 664A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that a farmer may take an income tax or corporation tax deduction for farm diesel (including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel) and then a further deduction for farm diesel which is equal to the  difference between the carbon tax charged and the carbon tax that would have been charged had it been calculated at the rate of &euro;41.30 per 1,000 litres of farm diesel (the 2012 baseline). This equates to almost 5 cent per litre.</p>  <p>  Different VAT rates also apply, 23% on auto diesel and 13.5% on green diesel.</p>  <p>  My colleagues across Government and i continue monitor the situation closely.</p></reply>
