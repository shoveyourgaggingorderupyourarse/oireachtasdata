Engagement with members of LEEF has taken place in a number of formats in recent months. I have held separate introductory meetings with LEEF members, ICTU and IBEC.  The LEEF Consultative Forum on the Return to Work Protocol has met on a number of occasions, most recently this week.</p>  <p>  A meeting of the LEEF subgroup on Employment Legislation, chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, also took place on 30 September. This meeting was attended by representatives of ICTU, IBEC, Chambers Ireland and the Construction Industry Federation. Issues discussed included Sick Pay and the Report of the Low Pay Commission.</p>  <p>  Further meetings of LEEF and its various sub-groups will take place in the coming period with arrangements to be confirmed.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the programme for Government, a unit to help co-ordinate future social dialogue has been established within my Department. This unit will seek to create new models of sectorial engagement with a wide range of stakeholders across civil society. It is part of the economic division of my Department, which is already involved in dialogue with the social partners.</p></reply>

I know that some firms are concerned about how they are going to continue to pay the rent due for their business premises. Throughout this crisis, the Government has been encouraging commercial tenants and landlords to engage with each other and have asked landlords to show forbearance in these extraordinary times. Ultimately, it is in the best interest of both parties to come to a reasonable arrangement.</p>  <p>  To date the Government has provided enhanced provisions to a value of almost &euro;20 billion including the &euro;7.4 billion July Stimulus Package. The July Stimulus Package was, as promised, a package of measures of sufficient scale that demonstrates the commitment this Government has to save enterprises, limit the damage to our economy wreaked by this pandemic and get our people back to work. Indeed, it is bigger in scale than most budgets and it is being deployed at speed. It includes:</p>  <p>  - A new Employment Wage Support Scheme that will succeed the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and run until April 2021;</p>  <p>  - Restart Grants of up to &euro;25,000 available to a broad category of businesses such as hairdressers, sports clubs, cafes, restaurants, B&amp;Bs, and independent hotels to help cover the costs incurred during closure and reopening costs;</p>  <p>  - The &lsquo;Stay and Spend&rsquo; initiative will see consumers benefit by up to &euro;125 each for expenditure on hospitality activities during the traditional &lsquo;off peak&rsquo; for this sector;</p>  <p>  A &euro;10 million Restart Fund for the Tourism Sector;</p>  <p>  - The new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to provide Irish businesses with access to low cost loans as they respond to the impacts of COVID-19. This is the biggest ever state-backed loan guarantee in Ireland;</p>  <p>  - The recently reopened Microfinance Ireland Covid-19 Loan scheme; and</p>  <p>  - Several other initiatives to provide vital liquidity to all impacted firms have been introduced including rates waivers, temporary VAT reductions, delayed payment of PAYE and VAT debts, in part or in full, for a set period with no interest or penalties, and the early carry back of trading losses providing immediate cash-flow support to previously profitable companies.</p>  <p>  Recognising the economic impact of Covid-19 on pubs, bars and nightclubs, and to assist planning and adaptation for their re-opening, an additional &euro;16 million support package for this sector was announced at the end of August. This included a 40% Restart Grant Plus Top Up for pubs, bars and nightclubs that remain closed to help them to reopen, a waiver of court fees and associated excise and stamp duties relating to the renewal of pub and other liquor licences in 2020 and a waiver of excise duty on on-trade liquor licences on renewal in 2020.</p>  <p>On 1 October, I published a new voluntary Code of Conduct that has been agreed with landlords and business representatives for commercial renters. The Code, which is a commitment in the Programme for Government, has been developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including Ibec, Retail Excellence Ireland, Chambers Ireland and Irish Institutional Property (IIP). It is based on an approach taken in other jurisdictions, including Australia, France and the UK.</p>  <p>  The Code sets out how both parties can work together to get through these uncertain times. Landlords should be willing to do what they can to help their tenants to continue to operate rather than facing the risk of a vacant premises and inability to obtain new tenants.  Equally, tenants should pay what they can and speak with their landlord when difficulties arise.</p></reply>

It provides much-needed funding to help microenterprises meet payments for stock, working capital requirements and other overhead expenses through the provision of low-cost lending facilities.</p>  <p>  Microfinance Ireland provides vital support to microenterprises by filling the lending gap in the market by lending to business that cannot obtain loans from other commercial lenders.  It lends to business that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial lenders and applies interest rate charges for its lending which are not reflective of its credit risk.  </p>  <p>  Microfinance Ireland rescheduled 616 Performing Loans during March and April 2020. These loans were rescheduled to commence payments in October 2020.  Repayments are collected monthly on the 15th of each month.  The terms of the restructure were six months repayment free without any additional interest accruing, and the loan extended by six months.</p>  <p>  Of these 616 loans, 114 loans as at 31 September have been further restructured beyond 15 October.</p></reply>

This will build on the various improvements that have been made to social protections for workers over the last five years, including paternity benefit, parental leave benefit and the extension of social insurance benefits to the self-employed and those in the gig economy. In addition, further significant benefits, including enhanced illness benefit, have already been introduced by the Government in response to Covid-19.</p>  <p>I presented a draft Issues Paper on statutory sick pay to the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) Sub-Group on Employment Legislation/Regulation on Wednesday 30th September with a view to commencing a consultation process.  I requested that the social partners consider the range of issues and policy options set out in the paper and submit their views on the paper by 14th October. Representatives from ICTU, IBEC, Chambers Ireland and the Construction Industry Federation attended the meeting.</p>  <p>  The views of the Social Partners will be taken on board and the revised Paper will then be discussed at a further meeting of the LEEF Sub-Group.  It will then be presented to the plenary LEEF for agreement in advance of launching a full public consultation in November to complement the unions and employer groups input.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-07a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100700072#WRB01900"><p>Footfall is an indicator of trading and as we continue to adhere to public health guidelines in order to protect ourselves and each other, it has declined. Businesses and traders in Dublin city, and all across the country, are facing challenges at the present time and I understand this is a difficult time for many who are facing an uncertain future.</p>  <p>  Remote working is a flexible working solution with significant potential for Ireland although it is not without its challenges. The current incidence of people working from home, as a result of the global pandemic, is at a scale unprecedented in our country. The public health advice for people to work from home, where possible, is in the best interest of our nation. The priority of the Government continues to be the well-being of our people and communities and the best economic policy is to put public health first.</p>  <p>  To date the Government has provided enhanced provisions to a value of almost &euro;20 billion including the &euro;7.4 Billion July Stimulus Package. The July Stimulus Package was, as promised, a package of measures of sufficient scale that demonstrates the commitment this Government has to save enterprises, limit the damage to our economy wreaked by this pandemic and get our people back to work.

As such, the next steps in our recovery journey will be mapped out in the October Budget and the subsequent National Economic Plan.</p>  <p>  As per the recent Budget 2021 Strategy announcement, Budget 2021 will see additional crisis-related supports tailored to those sectors and workers who are most in need.</p>  <p>  The National Economic Plan will set out a vision for what our post-Covid economy will look like. The plan will set longer term objectives for the economy post crisis and identify policies and strategies to achieve those objectives. While the focus of Government action up to now has been on protecting workers, households and firms, the plan will need to look to the future and show how our economy can be positioned to exploit opportunities for growth in emerging sectors and in areas such as new ways of working, while also addressing how we will prepare for the transitioning of enterprises and workers in response to technology and climate change developments. Ireland&rsquo;s flexible and skilled labour force has traditionally been a strength of the country and reskilling and upskilling of the labour force in response to anticipated future skills needs a core element to be progressed under the plan.</p>  <p>  The plan will be progressed over the coming weeks and I would expect it to launch in November.</p></reply>

I understand that these restrictions will have a significant impact on businesses and employment around the country. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the impact of these restrictions on businesses, a 30% top-up to the Restart Plus grant will be provided to help support those affected through the three-week period. In addition, in recognising that Level 3 is being extended in Dublin and Donegal beyond the three-week period, businesses in these counties will be eligible for a further 20% and 10% top-up respectively.</p>  <p>  The Restart Grant Plus provides direct grant aid to businesses with up to 250 employees to help them with the costs associated with reopening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. The grant is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. The grant could also be used to defray ongoing fixed costs during closure, for example, utilities, insurance, refurbishment or for measures to ensure employee and customer safety.</p>  <p>  In most cases the grant will be the amount of the rates assessment for the premises for 2019, with a minimum grant is &euro;4,000 and the maximum grant is &euro;25,000 (or maximum of &euro;15,000 for businesses that received the maximum of &euro;10,000 under the original Restart Grant Scheme). Top-ups were previously introduced in August and September for eligible businesses in Kildare, Laois, Offaly, Dublin and Donegal in respect of a further period of restrictions, for &lsquo;wet&rsquo; pubs, bars and nightclubs nationwide that re-opened on 21 September, and for &lsquo;wet&rsquo; pubs, bars and nightclubs in Dublin that remain closed. </p>  <p>  Businesses that accessed funding through the original round of the Restart Grant Scheme are eligible for a top-up payment to a total combined value of the revised maximum grant level. Applications are made through the Local Authorities. Full details and application forms are available on the websites of all Local Authorities until 31st October 2020.</p>  <p>  The Restart Grant Plus is just one part of the wider range of schemes available to firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are there to help small and medium-sized businesses during this crisis. They are a &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for businesses providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to business owners throughout the country. The LEOs also offer a business mentoring service, where they can assist enterprises in identifying what supports are appropriate and can also assist with the completion of applications for those schemes. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the LEOs have moved training programmes, workshops and networking meet-ups online, covering areas such as cash management in a crisis, leading your business through COVID-19 and advice for employers impacted by the crisis. The LEOs also launched the LEO Client Training Initiative which is a new &lsquo;Lunch &amp;amp; Learn&rsquo; live training webinar series. This is open and accessible to all LEO client companies and prospective clients across the country, with no registration or sign-up required.  </p>  <p>  The LEOs also provide Trading Online Vouchers to assist micro-enterprises to establish an on-line presence quickly.  New flexibilities to the Scheme were introduced in April including reducing the requirement for co-funding from 50% to 10% and allowing businesses to apply for a second voucher of up to &euro;2,500 where they have successfully utilised their first one. There has been a positive response to these changes and significant uptake of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  On 14th September last I announced the Micro-Enterprise Assistance Fund which will help businesses with fewer than 10 employees, which are ineligible for existing grants, with a grant of up to &euro;1,000 to help them adapt and invest to rebuild their business.  Businesses impacted by a 30% reduction in turnover due to COVID-19 restrictions or downturn in trade will be eligible provided they commit to reopening and to hiring and sustaining employment. It is estimated that about 2,000 businesses nationwide will benefit.</p>  <p>  All COVID-19 Business Schemes are under constant review in terms of the evolving situation and will be adapted as circumstances dictate. In that regard, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my colleagues across Government and all stakeholders to examine how best to further assist businesses impacted by COVID-19 as part of the forthcoming Budget and National Economic Plan.</p></reply>

As part of this,  the Government will consider the potential of the Shannon Estuary in terms of regional economic development across transport and logistics, manufacturing, renewable energy and tourism, and develop a strategy to achieve this potential, with support from the Exchequer.  </p>  <p>  I can however assure the Deputy that jobs and enterprise in the regions is a priority of Government and I want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic growth. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government provides that as Ireland moves towards carbon neutrality it does not make sense to develop LNG gas import terminals importing fracked gas.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department&rsquo;s nine Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 were launched by my Department in early 2019 with the South-West Regional Enterprise Plan which covers counties Kerry and Cork being launched in February of that year.  These Plans play a central role in supporting the delivery of balanced regional enterprise development and in ensuring that employment growth is spread across all regions. The Plans are also maintained as &lsquo;live&rsquo; agendas which aim to be agile and responsive to both new opportunities and new challenges, for example: Brexit, Climate Action, Digital Economy, and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic economic impacts.</p>  <p>  At the end of June this year my predecessor as Minister, Heather Humphreys TD met with the Chairpersons of the nine Regional Enterprise Plan Committees including the Chair of the South-West Committee on a conference call and invited them to work with their Committees to identify proposals that would help to address economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in their region. These groups are meeting in virtual format over the coming weeks to focus on this and will report back to my Department, with a view to contributing to the development of the National Recovery Plan in due course. </p>  <p>I can advise the Deputy that the South West Regional Steering Committee met on 28th July last and considered the range of  COVID-19 and wider economic challenges for the South West region and indeed issues arising in relation to vulnerable jobs and sectors. They are currently developing options for additional measures that can be taken for the region.  </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Government has put several funding streams in place to support regional development and the South-West has seen a number of successes under my own Department&rsquo;s regional funding streams.  These include over &euro;17.5m under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) and &euro;987,478 under the Regional Technology Clustering Fund, with &euro;581,138 being awarded to IT Tralee.</p>  <p>  Guided by the Regional Enterprise Plan, and with all regional stakeholders working together, the South-West region is well positioned to realise its enterprise potential and see better quality, sustainable jobs and investment.</p></reply>

An interactive map showing ESB charger locations and their status can be found at . </p><p>We have committed &euro;10 million from the Climate Action Fund to promote the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB.

It consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate national electricity policy objectives for renewables and security of supply. From a policy standpoint, the PSO has been and will continue to be a vital policy support for the development of renewable electricity and to enable Ireland to reach EU renewable energy targets and our own national energy and climate targets.Under the PSO legislation, the calculation of the Levy is strictly a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, the independent electricity and gas regulator. The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Public Service Obligations Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002) under which the CRU is assigned responsibility for calculation of the levy each year. The methodology for determining the PSO levy charge is set out in Public Service Obligations Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002). </p><p>The CRU&rsquo;s decision on the PSO for 2020/21 will result in an increase in the PSO for households of &euro;3.68 per month.  </p><p>As regards impacts on households of reduced means, I am acutely aware of the financial challenges faced by households during these exceptional times. Government provides extensive supports for household energy costs via welfare schemes and energy efficiency grants, with specific schemes aimed at those at risk of energy poverty. Welfare supports include the Household Benefits Package and the fuel allowance, both operated by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which provide a set of allowances to help with the costs of running household energy costs.Improving the energy efficiency of a home also represents a significant opportunity for consumers to reduce their energy costs. Energy efficiency upgrades are provided free of charge to households at risk of energy poverty mainly through the Warmer Homes scheme, operated by the Sustainable Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department. In 2020 the budget allocated is &euro;52.8 million, largest ever budget allocation for the scheme. </p><p>The PSO is only one part of the total electricity bill. The CRU emphasises that savings on the variable aspect of the electricity bill can be gained through switching electricity supplier. All supply companies offer competitive deals to customers who switch or engage with their suppliers. Data from approved price comparison websites, <i>Bonkers.ie, Switcher.ie </i>and <i>Powertoswitch.ie</i>, approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, exist to assist consumers to switch; for example as of 6 October 2020, consumers could save up to &euro;307 annually, depending on the tariff they are on, by switching suppliers.  This could help mitigate the increase in the PSO.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).  The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. </p><p>The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. As of 28 September, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 23 counties and steady progress is being made with over 98,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. </p><p>This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year in Cork. NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website (<i></i>).</p><p>In Mayo, 5,400  premises have been surveyed to date and network designs are being developed to deliver the new fibre network. Areas surveyed include Aghagower, Ballyhean, Breaghwy, Burren, Castlebar, Clogher, Cloonkeen, Croaghmoyle, Islandeady, Killavally, Manulla, Pontoon, Strade, Tawnynagry, Turlough, Drumsheen, and Bunnyconnellan. In addition surveyors are working on the ground in Ballina Town, Carrowntreila, Ardagh, Campbells Crossroads, Rosserk, Shanvoley, Derryhick, Kilhale, Tawnylaheen, Turlough, Ballyvary, Keeloges, Castlebar Town, Rinnaseer, Bellaburke, Killawullaun Mountain, Carn, Carnacon, Ballyglass, Belcarra, Balla and Ringarraun. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 155 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools. </p><p>In Mayo, Scoil N&eacute;ifinn in Keenagh is installed and will be connected for educational access as part of this initiative, while the public will be able to benefit from this service at locations across the county such  as Taugheen, Bofeenaun, Islandeady and Killaser  Community Centres which are all installed and due for connection. Further details can be found at <i></i>. </p><p>I understand that there can be instances where premises remain unconnected, although close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network. Eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. </p><p>Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind.

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>As of 28 September, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 23 counties and steady progress is being made with over 98,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year. </p><p>NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website (<i></i>).</p><p>Surveys have recently commenced in the areas around Tipperary and the surrounding townlands of Aherloe, Ballinalard and Bansha with over 3,300 premises  surveyed to date. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 155 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools. </p><p>In Tipperary, Poulacapple National School and Killeen National School will be connected to high speed broadband as part of the BCP initiative, while the public will be able to benefit from this service at locations across the county such as Aglish Community Hall, Drom Community Centre, Moyglass Community Hall, and Killurney Community Centre which are all installed and due for connection. Further details can be found at <i></i></p><p>I understand that there can be instances where premises remain unconnected although close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network. eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.</p></reply>

It consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate national electricity policy objectives for renewables and security of supply. From a policy standpoint, the PSO has been and will continue to be a vital policy support for the development of renewable electricity and to enable Ireland to reach EU renewable energy targets and our own national energy and climate targets.Under the PSO legislation, the calculation of the Levy is strictly a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), the independent electricity and gas regulator. The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Public Service Obligations Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002) under which the CRU is assigned responsibility for the calculation of the levy each year. The methodology for determining the PSO levy charge is set out in the Public Service Obligations Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002). </p><p>The CRU issued its proposed decision paper on the 2020/21 PSO levy for consultation on 8th June 2020 in accordance with its annual process of determining the PSO levy in line with its function above. This document is available in the public domain here <i>.</i></p><p>The CRU then published its decision on the amount of the PSO for 2020/2021 on 31st July 2020 and it is also available in the public domain here</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The CRU&rsquo;s decision on the PSO for 2020/21 will result in an increase in the PSO for households of &euro;3.68 per month. The decision paper includes detailed material on reasons for the increase, under the headings upward and downward drivers of the levy.  </p><p>Under the Electricity Regulation Act, the CRU is directly responsible for the performance of its functions to a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas, and not to me as Minister. The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provide a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions directly to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply. </p></reply>

A large amount of credits notes have already been issued by the sector &ndash; which is guaranteed by the State - and this is money that the industry would otherwise have had to pay back in cash refunds.   </p>  <p>  I know that businesses in the sector are looking for more, and the Irish Travel Agents Association has made representations on behalf of its members for additional financial supports in the form of top-ups to small business support schemes announced in the July Stimulus.

I shall contact the RSA to see that a response is expedited.</p>  <p>  My Department is remaining in close contact with the RSA as they deal with the increased demand for their driver testing service  since operations resumed following its temporary closure due to the COVID emergency. In addition to this, due to the social distancing requirements, normal daily capacity is considerably reduced. This means that customers will experience longer waiting times than was the case before the service was suspended. The public&rsquo;s patience and understanding in this regard is requested.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that those who had appointments cancelled due to Covid 19 are being prioritised in the first instance. Priority then will be given in order of application date.  While there is some capacity for urgent test slots, the Road Safety Authority (RSA)'s capacity to make these available in all cases will be limited. Therefore, initially those who are front-line healthcare workers will be deemed eligible for an urgent test slot. This approach for prioritising customers will be kept under review as the RSA moves through the service resumption.</p></reply>

We need to ensure that the new Plan will be ambitious in reach, grounded in evidence, and backed with a determination to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s emissions commitments in fair and effective ways.</p>  <p>As part of this work, my Department will examine the issue of decreasing speed limits as a potential emission-saving measure, building on previous consideration of the relationship between speed limits and fuel consumption, journey times, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions.  The Deputy may recall that the Department explored the impact of reducing maximum speed limits on motorways from 120km/h to 110km/h for cars and vans and from 90km/h to 80km/h for heavy goods vehicles as a potential mitigation measure in the National Mitigation Plan.  Further analysis carried out to develop the Climate Action Plan 2019 suggested that such speed limit reductions could abate approximately 1,700kt CO2   of transport emissions between 2020 and 2030.  </p>  <p>It is worth noting that the actual reduction in fuel consumption that can be realised through the setting and enforcement of lower speed limits for motorway driving depends not just on the limit, but also on a number of external factors including vehicle types, driving patterns, the frequency of speeding, road load patterns, and congestion levels.  I also understand that carbon savings from lower speed can vary markedly for individual vehicles depending on engine characteristics, vehicle weight, distances travelled, and supplementary equipment such as trailers, rear-mounted storage racks or even taxi signs.  Over time, the emissions standards for vehicles and the fuels that power them are becoming more stringent, and the use of renewable biofuels as a share of road transport energy has increased significantly over recent years with estimates that, in 2018, biofuel use saved over 500 tkCO2  , over 4% of transport emissions.  Such welcome developments will, however, erode the potential emissions reduction benefits of reducing speed limits.</p>  <p>  Variable and reduced speed limits have been introduced in other jurisdictions in Europe where, in many cases, the primary focus of such interventions is air quality.  For example, in Austria when air quality levels along motorways are poor, speed limits are automatically reduced to 100kph from 130kph. </p>  <p>Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) will soon be conducting the enhancing Motorway Operations Services (eMOS)   project which will see the introduction of variable speed limits along the M50. The primary aim of this will be to improve the operational efficiency of the motorway by smoothing traffic flow, improving journey time reliability and reducing the number of traffic collisions.  It is expected that there will also be environmental benefits arising from the variable speed limiting project.</p></reply>

The NDLS has now resumed services however they are unable to facilitate any walk-ins due to the social distancing requirements and in the interest of protecting the staff and customers. Therefore, all appointments must be booked in advance. This, of course, has led to an increase in the demand for appointments. </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is working with their providers to see how they can create the additional capacity needed as quickly as possible, while adhering to the return to work protocol. Options being introduced include a combination of additional staff, extended and additional operating hours (i.e. Sundays where needed), and the provision of overtime.  </p>  <p>  The NDLS booking system is undergoing software changes to cater for the expanded booking window associated with the additional NDLS appointment slots, with testing commencing this week.   </p>  <p>  The introduction of these steps may help ease some of the pressure on the NDLS, free up appointment slots and make it easier to find those slots at local centres. The RSA is continuing work with my Department to expand the current online facility to accommodate all driving licence and learner permit application types. </p>  <p>  Some applicants for driving licences, such as those for truck or bus categories or persons with certain medical conditions, are required to provide a medical report with their applications. The medical report must not be dated more than one month prior to the date of application to ensure that the most up-to-date assessment of the applicant is provided.</p></reply>

An employer will have a monthly ongoing obligation to review its eligibility for the scheme. </p>  <p>  To ensure that the EWSS scheme is operated as intended by employers, Revenue will undertake an assurance check programme at a later date. </p>  <p>  Questions relating to an individual&rsquo;s entitlements and rights in an employment context, what wages an employer may be legally obliged to pay employees in respect of hours worked and an employer&rsquo;s capacity to pay wages to employees in light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the employer&rsquo;s business are all matters that are outside the remit of the EWSS. </p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise that the information outlined above relates to the general operation of the EWSS and does not relate to any one employer or a small group of employers within any one industry.</p></reply>

Supplies of capital goods in the agriculture sector, including farm machinery and equipment, is liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 21%, and there is no scope under the Directive to apply a reduced rate or to exempt such supplies.    The Directive specifies categories of goods and services in respect of which Member States may apply a reduced rate of VAT, which include the supply of livestock semen and animal insemination services; Ireland applies the reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%, to these supplies. The Directive does not permit the exemption of such supplies from VAT. </p>  <p>  Farmers may register for VAT or be treated as flat-rate farmers for VAT purposes. Farmers who elect to register for VAT have an entitlement to reclaim VAT on costs, including farm machinery and equipment and semen costs, incurred in relation to their farm business; if they remain unregistered they are entitled to apply a flat-rate addition to their supplies to VAT registered businesses. The flat rate addition compensates farmers at the aggregate level for the VAT borne on input costs, including farm machinery and equipment and semen costs.</p></reply>

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.   </p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:</p>  <p>  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p>  <p>  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p>  <p>  be without both hands or without both arms; </p>  <p>  be without one or both legs; </p>  <p>  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p>  <p>  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  </p>  <p>  A Supreme Court decision of 18 June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. </p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. My officials are currently examining the judgement, in conjunction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, and will bring forward any policy and/or legislative proposals, as necessary, for my consideration in due course.  </p>  <p>  In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p>  <p>  My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. </p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I anticipate that the work that is currently ongoing in relation to this matter will provide a proper basis for me to make a decision on the best pathway forward and to address the current legal uncertainty surrounding the Scheme. I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis.</p></reply>

There are a number of areas that require reform and this is why making progress on these problems will require a &lsquo;whole-of-Government&rsquo; approach as recognised in the PfG. This lays out specific commitments that are aimed at addressing consumer and business concerns on the cost of insurance.  These include increasing transparency; reviewing duty of care legislation; looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; minimising the scope for questionable claims; and increasing competition in the market. </p>  <p>  Implementation of this agenda will be a key issue for myself and Minister of State Fleming as well other members of Cabinet, especially those that will be working on this through the recently established Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment&rsquo;s sub-Group on Insurance Reform.  This sub-Group held its inaugural meeting on 1 October and identified a number of key deliverables to be progressed before the end of 2020.  The Sub-group is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and also includes myself, Ministers McGrath, McEntee, and O&rsquo;Gorman, together with Ministers of State Troy and Fleming as standing members.  I believe that this sub-Group provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance through a cross-Governmental response.  This will build and expand upon the previous commendable work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group. </p>  <p>  As you will be aware, a number of important reforms have already taken place, and the impact of these is reflected in the recent CSO data which indicate that the cost of private motor insurance is now a third cheaper than at its peak in July 2016. The sub-Group will focus on those reforms needed to ensure that similar reductions in cost can be extended to other areas of insurance, most notably, Employer and Public Liability insurance, which are among the main concerns for businesses. </p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, in that regard, a necessary step is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. The establishment of the Judicial Council last December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the Judicial Council shortly. While the adoption of those Guidelines will be a matter for the Judicial Council, it is desirable that the Guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and also could lead to a more consistent application of making awards in courts.  Insurance Ireland has indicated that if award levels come down so will premiums charged by its members.  I believe that this is a very important statement and this Government intends holding the insurance industry to this commitment.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, the Deputy can rest assured that in addition to all the other measures that Government has taken over recent months to support SMEs, the issue of insurance reform is a key priority issue for this Government. In that context we will continue to seek to ensure that progress is made in this policy area.</p></reply>

Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS are subject to income tax and USC. </p>  <p>  While income tax and the USC on most income is deducted in real-time as and when the person is paid, the TWSS payments were not taxed in real-time and are instead liable to income tax and USC at the end of the year (2020).</p>  <p>  Revenue will make a Preliminary End of Year Statement available to all employees in January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.  The Preliminary End of Year Statement includes information relating to an employee&rsquo;s income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protect, as well as their tax credit entitlements.  For the tax year 2020, the Statement will also include information on the amounts of TWSS payments, if any, received by each employee.  In addition, the Statement will provide employees with a preliminary calculation of the income tax and USC position for 2020 and will indicate whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid or overpaid for the year.</p>  <p>  Upon viewing the Preliminary End of Year Statement through myAccount, which is Revenue&rsquo;s secure online facility for individual taxpayer services, employees will have an opportunity to update their personal record, declare any additional income and claim any additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses, to arrive at their final liability for 2020.</p>  <p>  Where a liability is finalised, individuals may opt to fully or partially pay any income tax and USC liability through the Payments/Repayments facility in myAccount.  Where individuals do not opt to fully or partially pay, Revenue will collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over 4 years, interest free.  The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.</p>  <p>  On 25 September 2020, Revenue provided an update, by way of public announcement, as to how any tax liability arising on the TWSS will be dealt with. I am pleased to welcome this fair and flexible approach being taken by and I am confident that Revenue will continue to work with their customers to minimise any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible, noting that because of our progressive income tax system, in the vast majority of cases, the expected tax liability will be modest in scale.</p></reply>

The arrangements apply to VAT liabilities in respect of January/February 2020 to July/August 2020 inclusive and PAYE (Employer) liabilities in respect of February to August 2020 inclusive.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides that outstanding VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities incurred during the period of restricted trading (known as Period 1) can be deferred for a period of 12 months after resumption of trading (known as Period 2). Rather than the normal interest rate of c. 10% per annum on such liabilities, interest on &lsquo;warehoused&rsquo; debts is applied at 0% to the end of &lsquo;Period 2&rsquo; and 3% thereafter until the liabilities are paid (known as Period 3).  While the debt must ultimately be paid, taxpayers can repay it over an extended &lsquo;Period 3&rsquo; timeline, depending on their financial circumstances and avail of the reduced 3% interest rate for the payment duration.</p>  <p>  Access to the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; arrangements is dependent on all outstanding tax returns being filed and current taxes being paid on a timely basis once trading is resumed. The 0% interest rate available in Period 2 can be extended to a date no later than 31 December 2022 by Ministerial Order. Businesses that avail of the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; scheme also qualify for a Tax Clearance Certificate if they otherwise meet the normal qualifying conditions. This allows them to avail of other essential Covid-19 related supports such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the Stay and Spend Scheme. There are almost 70,000 taxpayers and businesses currently availing of the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; arrangements to the value of &euro;1.8 billion (&euro;978m VAT and &euro;825m Employers PAYE). </p>  <p>  As a further support measure for businesses, I also introduced the reduced 3% annual interest rate for certain non- Covid-19 related tax debts as part of the July 2020 Jobs Stimulus Package. This rate represents a significant reduction from the standard 8% and 10% rates that normally apply to such liabilities and is applicable across all tax-heads and outstanding debts that cannot be &lsquo;warehoused&rsquo;, for example older liabilities and as well as tax debts not associated with Covid-19. The interest rate reduction is a key incentive to businesses to bring their tax affairs into order, be tax cleared, and thereby become eligible for the other Covid-19 related supports that are available, including the EWSS and the Stay and Spend Scheme.  </p>  <p>To avail of the reduced 3% rate, businesses are required to agree a payment arrangement with Revenue by 31 October 2020. Revenue has advised me that almost &euro;50m of non-Covid-19 related tax debt is now covered by phased payments incorporating the reduced 3% rate.</p></reply>

There is also a commitment to the development of a &rdquo;national remote working strategy&rdquo; and to that end, a Remote Working Strategy Inter-Departmental Group has been established.  Officials from my Department are included in this group which is chaired by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  A number of issues are being considered as relevant to these commitments, the results of which will be made public in due course.</p><p>In terms of the current tax treatment of the costs associated with working from home, I would note that any such costs incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business by an employer (for example, the provision of equipment) may be deducted by the employer in the normal course of calculating the tax liability of their business.</p><p>From the perspective of the individual employee, there is no specific tax credit available to employees where they work from home.  The consideration of the introduction of any such credit would need to balance a number of factors including issues of equity, noting that not every worker is able to work remotely or from home for a variety of reasons including the nature of their work and also the nature of their home environment.  </p><p>However, I am advised by Revenue that where e-workers incur certain extra expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment remotely or from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 per day to such employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC. </p><p>Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.</p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, I am advised that employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use.</p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end.  Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website. I am advised by Revenue that where a deduction in respect of expenses in relation to working from home is claimed in a tax return, the amounts are included in a general &lsquo;Expenses&rsquo; field. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the number or value of specific claims in relation to these expenses.</p><p>Finally, I am advised that Revenue have published detailed guidance on e-working arrangements in their Tax and Duty manual TDM e-Working and Tax. </p></reply>

This is comprised of &euro;1.35bn until the end of 2020 and &euro;0.9bn in 2021.</p><p>These costs are on the basis that the EWSS will support around 350,000 jobs into the beginning of 2021. Revenue have estimated that 360,000 workers were supported by the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) when it concluded at the end of August, so this expected level of coverage of EWSS is considered to be a reasonable assumption.  </p><p>However, the cost of the EWSS will depend on the overall uptake of the scheme which will become fully apparent after the first claims have been processed in October 2020.  I am advised by Revenue that, as of 1 October 2020, there were 37,581 employers registered for the EWSS which is considered a strong level of participation being over 83 per cent of all those who availed of the TWSS over the duration of that scheme.</p><p>It is emphasised that these cost projections are subject to review and for every additional 50,000 qualifying employments over the duration of the scheme, the cost is estimated to increase by &euro;0.25 billion.  </p><p>As the scheme is demand led I have been clear that a significant increase in the number of claims may require a policy review and re-evaluation of the terms of the scheme. This is why the enacting legislation (Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020) provides that adjustments may be made to certain elements of the scheme. Following monitoring and regular assessments of the EWSS, such adjustments may be made by the Minister for Finance via secondary legislation, having consulted with my colleagues the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The specific elements (set out in subsection 21 of the Act) are:</p><p>the end date of the measure;</p><p>the rate of subsidy and applicable income threshold per employee; and </p><p>the turnover test to determine qualifying employers.</p><p>The cost estimate for the EWSS as set out above is based on the scheme being implemented in its totality as currently configured.</p><p>As the Deputy was previously advised, it is not possible at the present time to provide a reliable estimate of the cost impact of alterations to individual elements of the scheme (such as the rates and qualifying criteria).However, once Revenue has received finalised EWSS returns relating to September, and there is a base to benchmark a cost estimate of the elements suggested by the Deputy, the question may be revisited.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-07a.155.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100700074#WRD03500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 70 together.</p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which has been operating since 1 July has replaced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) which expired on 31 August 2020.  The EWSS will remain in place until March 2021, thereby allowing employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable. It should be noted that while the TWSS was essentially an employee based subsidy which had to be passed on to the employees through the normal weekly / fortnightly /monthly payroll runs, the EWSS is an employer subsidy to help support viable firms and employers insofar as is possible.  </p>  <p>As set out in the recently enacted Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020, the EWSS is based on the monthly PAYE/PRSI return to Revenue which is due on the 14th of the month following payment of wages.   I am advised by Revenue that the operation of the EWSS is an automated solution, designed to operate at a system level with the monthly PAYE employer returns. The PAYE system is based on the employer reporting payroll runs as they occur. Revenue then posts the monthly return by the fifth day of the following month and the employer has until the 14th of the month to make any corrections to the return. The monthly return is finalised on the 14th  .</p>  <p>  The EWSS was designed to build on the PAYE monthly system and is a subsidy calculated on the number of qualifying employees. The intention was that Revenue will make the payment into the designated bank account as soon as practicable after that date, typically within 2 days. Thus, for September the intention was that Revenue would start to initiate bank transfers on 16 October. </p>  <p>  However, in light of the concerns from some employers on the cash flow impact and acknowledging that this is an extremely challenging time for businesses and employers, on 7 October 2020, Revenue provided an update, by way of public announcement, that it has brought forward the date of payment for EWSS supports to eligible employers. EWSS payments in respect of September payroll submissions, which were due to be made as soon as possible after 14 October, will now be paid into the designated bank accounts of eligible employers by this Friday morning, 9 October. </p>  <p>  Revenue also confirmed that all future monthly EWSS payments due to eligible employers will be made as soon as possible after the fifth day of the following month. The accelerated payment date aligns with the availability of the monthly &lsquo;Employer PAYE Return Submission Statement&rsquo;, which is made available to employers in Revenue&rsquo;s Online Service, ROS, by the fifth of the following month.  </p>  <p>Thus, with this in mind, Revenue further advise that it is extremely important that employers make timely and correct payroll submissions as they will now only have the opportunity to make any necessary corrections before the subsidy is paid instead of up until the payroll return filing date of the 14th   of the month.</p>  <p>  I welcome Revenue&rsquo;s supportive approach to businesses by bringing the date of payment forward for EWSS supports to eligible employers during the current crisis which aims to ease any cashflow for those employers concerned. Over 37,900 employers are now registered with Revenue for EWSS.  Furthermore,  Revenue also confirmed that EWSS payments due in respect of September payroll submissions are currently being processed and it provisionally expects that payments of just under &euro;250 million will be paid to 31,700 employers in respect of 335,000 employees.  Additionally, Revenue&rsquo;s PAYE system will credit monthly employer PRSI liabilities by approximately &euro;60 million to account for the reduced rate of PRSI that applies to wages that are eligible for the EWSS.</p>  <p>  It should be recognised that the IT system to support EWSS was developed in close co-operation with the payroll software providers and that any further changes to the operation of the system at this stage, will require significant software developments which could put at risk the smooth operation of the scheme which provides support to these 31,700 employers.</p>  <p>  Finally, for these businesses who need further support, or who experience cash-flow difficulties arising for the timing of the subsidy payments, there are a number of options open to them &ndash; including State backed loans which may be repaid using EWSS funds as well as grants.  Particular attention is drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan - including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p></reply>

These exemptions in general may apply to means tested-payments. </p>  <p>  As I have previously advised, the position is that payments made under the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) Scheme are an income support and share the characteristics of income.  Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  It is also the case that PRSI contributions are attributed to persons in receipt of the PUP.  In the interest of equity, therefore, payments made under the PUP scheme are subject to income tax; the taxation position will also follow the general taxation rule for social welfare payments and, thus, while liable to income tax, the payments will be exempt from PRSI and the Universal Social Charge.  </p>  <p>  Finally, in relation to the Deputy's reference to urgent needs payments, the PUP may have been designated as such but only for social welfare and budgetary provision purposes.</p></reply>

The Office of Government Procurement (OGP), an office within my Department, has been actively engaged in this area and will continue to enhance the significant measures and strategies already in place to support SME access to public procurement opportunities. </p>  <p>  Public procurement is bound by EU and national law and requires that everything we do is bound by the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment of all bidders.  These principles and rules are there to ensure that all bidders are treated exactly the same, in order to allow a level playing pitch for all businesses regardless of business size or location, to avoid favouritism and localism, and to combat corruption.  Transparency also ensures that the competition phases and contract awards are all conducted in public, so that taxpayers, the media, elected representatives and those who participate in these competitions can see both the competitions progressing and the outcomes.  Therefore all of the procurement processes that are run by the OGP, including the new Security Services Framework Agreement, which commenced on 14 September 2020, are open and transparent and observe these important principles.  </p>  <p>  The OGP made a very concerted effort to inform the marketplace in relation to the competition for this Framework Agreement and to encourage SME participation by dividing the Framework Agreement into geographical and financial lots.  In line with best practice and in adherence with EU Public Procurement legislation, the tender process for the Provision of Security Services was advertised in a transparent and open manner.  In November 2019 the market was advised via a prior information notice (PIN) on eTenders of the OGP's intention to run a competition for these services, according to our records the PIN was viewed by the company in question.  As part of our market research a Request for Information survey was also issued in 2019 and the company in question submitted a response to the survey.   On 7 March 2020 suitably qualified service providers were invited to tender.  The deadline for tender responses was originally 15 April 2020 but this was extended to 1 May 2020 to facilitate Tenderers who may have been impacted as result of Covid-19.  According to our records the tender invitation was accepted and the tender documents were viewed by the company in question on 17 March 2020.   </p>  <p>  As the deadline for tender responses has passed and the Framework Agreement has commenced, it is not possible for this company, or any other company for that matter, to be appointed to the Framework Agreement as that would breach the principle of equal treatment.  You may wish to note that the Framework Agreement is for contracts individually with an estimated value of over &euro;69,500 (excl. VAT) based on a two (2) year contract and is for a period of three years, with an option to extend for a further year.</p></reply>

I recently put in place a suite of supports for music and musicians.  The Music Stimulus Package, involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular and commercial music sector across all music genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, indie, jazz, country, and traditional and folk.  Under this package, a fund of &euro;1,000,000 is being put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources including live event fees.  </p>  <p>  The music support schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support song writing camps, recording and album releases.  The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and share their work in the context of COVID restrictions. The Music Stimulus Package schemes will be managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment. </p>  <p>  In addition, I recently announced a new fund of &euro;5m that will assist established commercial promoters to employ performers, artists, technicians, creative and performance support staff up to the end of 2020 in anticipation of the return of audiences to live performance.  The &ldquo;Live Performance Support Scheme&rdquo; under my Department aims to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performances provide employment to workers in the creative industries.  The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector and allow commercial organisers of live performances to commence preparations immediately and productions to go ahead in the near future while also complying with public health protection measures. This scheme has been developed following consultation with the sector and is managed by my Department. I hope to announce the recipients of this funding in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The group assessed the initial impact of the pandemic based on feedback provided from industry stakeholders and facilitated the rapid sharing of key information and insights, to help improve understanding and responses to the crisis. It also discussed ideas and proposals for immediate mitigating actions and for recovery measures required to kick-start the industry. The group first met on 26 February and met seven times in total, holding its final meeting on 05 May. I wish to thank the membership of the group for their work and for the valuable role they played in assisting the Government in formulating its initial response to the crisis.</p>  <p>  In May, a Tourism Recovery Taskforce was appointed to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which includes a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis. In June, the Taskforce published an Initial Report recommending a number of measures to help save jobs and businesses across the sector, some of which have already been addressed in the July Stimulus package. The taskforce submitted its final Recovery Plan to me last week. It is making a number of recommendations to help the sector to survive the crisis and eventually recover. Along with my colleagues in Government, I will consider its recommendations as we prepare for the Budget and the subsequent National Economic Plan.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Industry Advisory Group continues to meet on a fortnightly basis, providing feedback and input from a cross section of the industry, helping to guide F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s response to this crisis and to provide supports to the industry. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-07a.192.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100700075#WRE01300"><p>Local authorities have been provided with a number of powers and measures to deal with the issue of derelict properties, both in larger urban conglomerations and in smaller rural towns and villages. There also exists a framework of overarching policy and capital funding which provides support to development, including urban regeneration.</p>  <p>  The Repair and Leasing Scheme was introduced to assist property owners in bringing vacant properties back into use for social housing purposes. The scheme is particularly targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties.</p>  <p>  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs is met up front with a capital loan from the local authority or an approved housing body (AHB) up to a maximum of &euro;40,000, and up to a maximum of &euro;50,000 in the situation where the property is a former bedsit. This allows the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement with a local authority or an AHB for a period of time that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum lease period of 5 years. Up to end 2019, a total of 165 homes had been brought back into use under the scheme.</p>  <p>  A similar measure entitled the Buy and Renew Scheme supports local authorities in purchasing and renewing housing units in need of repair which can then be made available for social housing use. It is a matter for each local authority to determine the suitability of a property for social housing. Important considerations in this regard include the location of a property in relation to housing need and demand; the design, scale and suitability of a property for social housing use; and the costs and practicality of acquiring and remediating a property.</p>  <p>  The Buy and Renew Scheme particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community.  As a complementary initiative to the Repair and Leasing Scheme, it provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased, if that is the preference of the owners of the properties concerned. Up until end June 2020, local authorities delivered over 585 new social homes under the scheme.  Activity in this regard is largely delegated to local authorities so they can respond flexibly to all opportunities to provide new social housing.</p>  <p>  The Derelict Sites Act 1990 imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.</p>  <p>  Local authority powers include requiring owners or occupiers to take appropriate measures on derelict sites, acquiring derelict sites by agreement, or compulsorily, and applying a derelict sites levy on derelict sites. It is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable enquiry, of any land which, in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site.  Under section 8(5) of the Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours. Members of the public can engage with their local authority in relation to addressing individual derelict sites in their local areas. </p>  <p>  Under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, both the Derelict Sites Levy and the Vacant Sites Levy increased from 3% to 7% of the market valuation of relevant sites with effect from January 2020. This change in the rate of the levies is intended to ensure that the levies have more meaningful impact and that the powers of local authorities in tackling dereliction and vacancy are strengthened for the purpose of bringing relevant sites into productive use, thereby facilitating urban regeneration and development in designated areas while also combatting land hoarding.</p></reply>

A core principle of the Project Ireland 2040 and the National Planning Framework (NPF), published in 2018, is the promotion of compact urban growth and the re-use of brownfield sites. </p>  <p>   The NPF includes specific objectives to regenerate cities, towns and villages of all types and scale, and in particular to reverse the stagnation or decline of many smaller urban centres, including measure to reduce vacancy, re-use existing buildings and promote infill and area or site-based regeneration.</p>  <p>   The important roles of our towns and villages, is reflected in the Programme for Government with the proposed development of a &ldquo;Town Centre First&rdquo; policy.  Similarly, the Programme for Government commits to the development of the cities of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway as viable alternatives to Dublin using Project Ireland 2040, to help regional towns prosper.  The Programme for Government notes the importance of balanced regional development in reducing environmental pressures and keeping our smaller urban centres vibrant.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have already been provided with a number of powers and measures to deal with the issue of vacancy and dereliction of in our urban centres. There also exists a framework of overarching policy and capital funding which provides support to development, including urban regeneration.</p>  <p>   From a legislative perspective, this includes,</p>  <p>  - the Derelict Sites Act 1990, which imposes a general duty on every owner and occupier of land to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site;</p>  <p>  - the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2018, which came into operation on 8 February 2018, and provides for an exemption from the requirement to obtain planning permission in respect of the change of use of certain vacant commercial premises, including vacant areas above ground floor premises, to residential use;</p>  <p>  - the vacant site levy provisions in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, under which planning authorities were empowered to apply a vacant site levy of 3% of the market valuation of relevant properties which were listed on local authority vacant site registers in 2018, which relevant owners were liable to pay in January 2019. The rate of the levy increased to 7% for sites listed on local authority vacant sites register from 2019 onwards which site owners became liable to pay in January 2020; and</p>  <p>  - local authorities also have compulsory purchase order powers which can be used in certain circumstances to address these issues.</p>  <p>  From a funding perspective, significant resourcing is being provided to enhance the urban environment of our cities, towns and villages through the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF) and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund established under Project Ireland 2040.  The URDF, which is the fund operated by my Department, was launched in 2018 and has an overall provision of &euro;2 billion to 2027.   The URDF was established to support applicant-led projects that will contribute to regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland&rsquo;s five cities and other large towns, in line with the objectives of the NPF and the NDP. This will be done by supporting proposals that contribute to the re-development of key brownfield areas, including areas containing derelict sites and buildings, both by enabling infrastructure and new master-planned development proposals.  88 projects across the breadth of the country have been approved for URDF support thus far.  A second call for proposals was launched in January of this year.  The closing date for applications was 29 May 2020 and these applications are now being assessed.</p>  <p>  Under the National Vacant Home Reuse Strategy 2018-21 my Department has, since 2018, provided financial assistance to each local authority to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. Each such office is tasked to support, implement and further develop, update, monitor and review the progress of local authorities&rsquo; Vacant Homes Action Plans and actions to address vacant private housing.  In addition, two schemes, the Repair and Lease and the Buy and Renew Schemes, were introduced to assist in bringing vacant stock back into use.</p></reply>

The review has not been finalised yet.</p><p>In relation to homeless services, under the Housing Act 1988 it is a matter for each local authority to determine whether a person is regarded as homeless; section 2 of the Act sets out the requirements in this regard. When a household has been assessed as homeless, section 10 of the Housing Act 1988, provides that a local authority may provide accommodation and related services to that household.</p><p>Any household assessed as homeless may be placed into temporary emergency accommodation without the requirement to undergo a social housing assessment, allowing local authorities the flexibility that is essential to respond quickly and effectively to the various needs of cases that may arise.</p></reply>

A Part 4 tenancy may be terminated by a landlord or tenant, without reason, at the end of its term. </p>  <p>  A number of measures have been introduced in recent years with the objective of improving security of tenure for tenants.  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 extended the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years, for tenancies commencing on or after 24 December 2016 as part of a transition to tenancies of indefinite duration.  </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 enhances further the security of tenure for tenants by significantly extending the duration of tenancy termination notice periods; for example, a minimum of 180 days (approx. 6 months) notice must be provided by landlords who terminate a tenancy of between 3 and 7 years&rsquo; duration. In addition, further measures have been introduced to enhance and enforce tenancy termination provisions, including the application of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB)'s new investigation and sanctioning regime to improper conduct by a landlord who contravenes the tenancy termination provisions. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government - 'Our Shared Future', commits to improve the security of tenure for tenants, through legislating for tenancies of indefinite duration, increasing RTB enforcement and examining incentives for long-term leasing. </p>  <p>  Subject to legal advices, I expect the General Scheme of the Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill to be submitted to Government in the coming months for approval to proceed to legal drafting. A provision relating to tenancies of indefinite duration is being considered in this context.</p></reply>

A core part of protecting the rights of landlords and tenants and supporting a well-functioning rental sector is to ensure that people are aware of their legal obligations to avoid disputes and where they arise, that there is an effective Dispute Resolution Service and robust enforcement powers.</p>  <p>  On 1 July 2019, the changes to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended) expanded the regulatory role of the RTB. Since July 2019, the RTB can proactively monitor the rental sector and investigate and sanction landlords who engage in certain breaches of rental law, defined as Improper Conduct. An important aspect of this regulatory role is that the RTB can commence investigations both on information received from members of the public as well as by using open source data and data available to the RTB, as outlined in the legislation. If a landlord is found to have committed a breach, a sanction can be applied ranging from a formal written caution to a fine of up to &euro;15,000 and/or costs of up to &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  An Investigations and Sanctions Unit (I&amp;S) was established within the RTB to enable the organisation to undertake this critical new function by identifying and investigating potential breaches of rental law.</p>  <p>  The breaches of rental law that the I&amp;S unit can investigate include; failure to comply with RPZ requirements; failure to register a tenancy; a reason given on a notice of termination that is known to be false or misleading; and failure to offer a tenant their tenancy back when certain conditions have been met. </p>  <p>  Sanctions can range from a written caution to a fine of up &euro;15,000 and &euro;15,000 in costs.</p>  <p>  Since 2019 to Q2 2020, 191 investigations have commenced on information identified by the I&amp;S Unit using data available to the RTB under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended). The focus for the remainder of 2020 is to conclude the cases commenced in 2019 and the first half of 2020 and progress them for decision by the RTB Sanctions Decision Makers and subsequent Circuit Court Confirmation of sanctions. The RTB will publish all sanctions confirmed by the Circuit Court as part of its stakeholder engagement strategy to promote the impact of the new Investigations and Sanctions function and encourage compliance with rental law. </p>  <p>  The RTB will also continue to commence new investigations with priority on investigating allegations of improper conduct raised by members of the public and other government agencies through concerns and formal written complaints.</p>  <p>  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il requested that arrangements be put in place to facilitate the provision of information by State Bodies to members of the Oireachtas.  Following the issue of Circular LG (P)05/16 on 20 September 2016 from my Department, the RTB set up a dedicated email address for this purpose. The RTB may be contacted at OireachtasMembersQueries@rtb.ie in relation to the matters raised.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p><p>The Government is committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing solutions are available to everyone in Irish society, and this is reflected in the Programme for Government &quot;Our Shared Future&quot;. The Programme commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing.</p><p>The current arrangements in relation to affordable purchase including eligibility criteria are set out in Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 2009. Under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), &euro;310 million funding has been made available to local authorities to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable new homes on local authority lands. With a maximum of &euro;50,000 infrastructure funding available per home, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  The funding support provided allows local authorities that have identified affordability challenges in their area to make homes available on their lands at more competitive prices. To date, of the total Serviced Sites funding available, &euro;127 million has been approved in principle in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes. It is anticipated that a further SSF call to local authorities will be made later this year.</p><p>In relation to the rental sector, the Programme for Government commits to improving security and affordability for renters. To achieve this, the Department is developing a Cost Rental model for housing that creates affordability for tenants and a sustainable model for construction and management of homes. Cost Rental is housing where the rents charged only cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes. It is intended for a target cohort of households with incomes above the limits for social housing provision, who are currently facing inflated rent levels in the private sector. Cost Rental is not intended to replace or overlap with social housing, which remains a priority for this Government. The precise eligibility conditions for Cost Rental are being developed and will be set in advance of the completion of the first Cost Rental projects.</p><p>There are a further two supports that may be of assistance to households to purchase their own home. The first is the Help to Buy (HTB) incentive is a scheme for first-time property buyers which may help with the deposit needed to buy or build a new house or apartment. Secondly there is the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. Following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan, a new loan offering was introduced, from 1 February 2018, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. The loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. </p><p>Single applicants for the loan must not be earning greater than &euro;50,000 gross per annum. The combined income of joint applicants must not be greater than &euro;75,000 per annum. There are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage in accordance with the statutory credit policy underpinning the loan. These income limits are unchanged from the previous local authority loan offerings.</p><p>In relation to affordable housing generally, I will outline detailed plans during the Autumn, informed by the Budget 2021 process.</p></reply>

The loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. </p><p>The purchase or self-build of a property must not exceed the maximum market value applicable for the county in which it is located:</p><p>- &euro;320,000 maximum purchase price for properties in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow (maximum loan amount of &euro;288,000);</p><p>- &euro;250,000 maximum purchase price for the rest of the country (maximum loan amount of &euro;225,000)</p><p>Initially, interest rates were set at a fixed rate for terms up to 25 years of 2.0%; fixed rate for terms up to 30 years of 2.25%; and variable rate for terms up to 30 years of 2.3%. On 15th August 2019, the variable interest rate option was discontinued - it had accounted for less than 1% of RIHL drawdowns.  On 15th January 2020 revised interest rates were set; loans with terms of up to 25 years have a fixed interest rate of 2.745%; and loans with terms of up to 30 years have a fixed interest rate of 2.995%. Per&euro;1,000 borrowed on a 25 and 30 year mortgage, the monthly interest charges are &euro;2.29 and &euro;2.50 respectively.</p><p>In addition there is a requirement to take out Local Authority Mortgage Protection Insurance, which costs 0.555%. Therefore, the overall cost of RIHL loans are 3.3% and 3.55%for 25 year and 30 year loans respectively.</p><p>The local authority MPI is a group scheme and is designed to provide an appropriate level of insurance cover to those who wish to avail of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. It offers a number of additional features over and above the standard MPI products available on the market. Standard MPI products are individually priced, based on a member&rsquo;s age, amongst other factors, whereas the local authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement, offering  a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.</p><p>The scheme also provides other benefits over standard MPI products. These include the payment of mortgage repayments if there is a valid claim as a result of disability; an additional payment of &euro;3,000 in the event of a member&rsquo;s death, separate to life cover; and members are also covered for death up to age 75 rather than 65 as is the case under standard MPI cover.</p><p>There are currently no plans to change the parameters of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans at this time.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p><p>As part of the overall review process, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of European Union Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. </p><p>As part of the SEA process, the previous Minister launched a ten-week public consultation on the draft revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 12 December 2019. The documents prepared for consultation are available on my Department's website at the following link:<i>. </i></p><p>The consultation closed on 19 February 2020. Almost 500 submissions were received as part of the public consultation, many of which are extremely detailed and technical in nature.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) is currently analysing the submissions received. </p><p>Finalised Guidelines will be prepared following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions received during the consultation phase, and the conclusion of the SEA process. The Department, in consultation with DECC, is endeavouring to finalise and publish the revised Guidelines by end Q4 2020, as per the Climate Action Plan and the new Programme for Government. </p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p><p>As part of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department is also currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions, and is actively engaging with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment as well as other key stakeholders. This review is now largely complete. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, to facilitate the generation of energy for self-consumption. Included in this review is the potential for extending the solar panel exemptions to educational and community buildings.</p><p>The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for &quot;glint and glare&quot; impacts for aircraft and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department is presently engaging with the DECC  as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. It is intended that work on this outstanding issue will be completed in the coming months.</p><p>As required under planning legislation, any such proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made.</p><p>With regard to offshore renewable energy projects, the Marine Planning and Development Management (MPDM) Bill is a hugely significant measure which is currently in train and is aimed at providing the legislative basis for Ireland's new marine planning regime. This is a transformational piece of legislation in terms of the maritime sector which deals with a number of complex and cross-departmental issues and the finalised General Scheme of the Bill was published in January this year.</p><p>The Programme for Government (PfG) commits the Government to prioritising the passage of a balanced and Aarhus compliant Marine Planning and Development Management Bill through the Oireachtas.Specifically, the PfG accords cross-Government priority to the drafting of the Bill, with the aim of enactment within nine months.Further policy work is continuing on the development of certain aspects of the proposed regime and intensive engagements in that regard are ongoing with the DECC, who are leading the development of the provisions in the Bill specific to Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE).</p><p>In addition to the policy development work, my Department is continuing to engage with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, other Departments and agencies on the drafting of the legal text.</p><p>In relation to the management of marine developments, including ORE, my Department is developing the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) - Ireland&rsquo;s first national marine spatial plan. The NMPF is the product of extensive and constructive work across Government, with the Department of the Environment, Climate &amp;amp; Communications contributing substantially, alongside a wide range of stakeholders. The NMPF sets out objectives and policies that will direct activities in Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area over the next 20 years and provides increased certainty to all involved with marine development.</p><p>The Framework will articulate important elements of the Programme for Government pertaining to renewable energy including a commitment to achieving 5GW capacity in offshore wind by 2030 off Ireland&rsquo;s Eastern and Southern coasts. The NMPF will be a consideration for all decision making related to Ireland&rsquo;s maritime area. Recognising that a plan-led approach represents a substantial change in marine management in Ireland, my Department is, alongside the NMPF, developing a public-facing digital tool that will support plan implementation including a digital map that will increase transparency of the various activities in Ireland&rsquo;s waters.</p><p>Following publication of the final NMPF in 2021, my Department will then work with others in Government as well as relevant stakeholders to produce statutory marine planning guidelines and it is intended that the first two sets of guidelines will focus on ORE and Development Management.</p><p>The legislative basis of the NMPF was set out in Part 5 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018. Those provisions will be restated in the MPDM legislation, augmented by additional provisions to maximise clarity and coherence.</p></reply>

The ninth round of EU-UK negotiations concluded on 2 October. While a degree of progress was made, much work remains to resolve key issues including a Level Playing Field for open and fair competition, fisheries, and governance. </p>  <p>  There was a brief update discussion on Brexit at the European Council on 2 October. The state of play in negotiations will be considered at the General Affairs Council on 13 October, and then by the EU's leaders at the European Council of 15-16 October.</p>  <p>  Following the most recent negotiating round, President von der Leyen and Prime Minister Johnson spoke on 3 October, when they instructed the EU and UK Chief Negotiators to work intensively to bridge the gaps in those areas where the parties are furthest apart. We expect that the Chief Negotiators will continue these efforts in the days and weeks ahead. Michel Barnier has our full support in this work. The Brexit transition period ends on 31 December but any new agreement will need to be reached in sufficient time to ensure that the ratification processes can be completed before that date.</p>  <p>  Work on the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement is also continuing through the appropriate channels. The Specialised Committee on Citizens Rights will meet later this week.  We also expect the Specialised Committee on Implementation of the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland to meet at the end of this week. Ireland will participate as part of the EU delegation at both these meetings. </p>  <p>  Ireland will work closely with our EU partners as we continue to chart a united path through the next crucial few weeks.  Meanwhile, at home, we continue our intensive domestic preparations to ensure that Ireland is ready for the end of the transition period. </p></reply>

Ireland, along with our EU partners, remains deeply concerned about the credible reports regarding  the treatment of ethnic Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, including reports on restrictions on freedom of religion and belief, arbitrary detention, widespread surveillance, forced labour, and forced sterilisations and birth control in the region.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been vocal about raising this issue, along with other partners in the international community. This week, Ireland is supporting a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee which reiterates our grave concern regarding the situation in Xinjiang, and recalls the exceptional letter of concern issued by 50 UN Special Procedures mandate holders which called on China to respect human rights and to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers. </p>  <p>  In our national statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 25 September, Ireland also urged China to allow unrestricted access to the region for the High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>  <p>  At EU level, the deterioration of the human rights situation, including the treatment of minorities in Xinjiang, was raised by EU leaders with China on 14 September, and it was agreed to discuss these issues further at an EU-China Human Rights Dialogue later this year. The matter was also raised during the EU-China Summit on the 22 June. </p>  <p>  Prior to this, Ireland was also one of 28 States to support a Joint Statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 30 June 2020, which also called on the High Commissioner to provide regular information about the situation in the region, in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms that are guaranteed under international law. </p>  <p>  Ireland has previously supported a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee in October 2019, and a Joint Letter at the UN Human Rights Council in July 2019, which called for the Chinese Government to urgently implement eight recommendations made by the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination related to Xinjiang, and to uphold its international obligations and respect human rights in Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and Ireland will continue to monitor and assess the situation and, along with our EU partners, engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora as appropriate.</p></reply>

All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on transport services for the 2020/2021 school year where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. The Department has also been engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the logistics involved with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, aligned to the public health advice received from NPHET shortly before schools reopened which advised that the post-primary scheme should run at 50% capacity.   The implementation of 50% capacity has been put in place where possible over the last number of weeks, while Bus &Eacute;ireann has been carrying out a detailed analysis of the resources required to fully implement the advice on all routes.  </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department have supported all bus contractors to put in place measures to support infection prevention and control on the buses.  The Department has also issued detailed information and guidance to parents and children on the operation of school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year. Measures include all post-primary students wearing masks, all bus drivers and bus escorts receiving PPE where necessary, as well as funding to support additional cleaning and hygiene measures, including the provision of sanitiser on all buses.   Seating plans with preassigned seating are in place on all routes, with children sitting next to their siblings or classmates where possible. This reduces the interaction of children on the buses with those outside of their family, class or school. </p>  <p>I am pleased to announce that, following a Government Decision on the 29th of September, Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure full implementation of the measures required for the operation of school transport for post-primary children that is aligned to updated health advice received from NPHET on the 18th   of August, for which the estimated full year cost to operate all services at 50% capacity is between &euro;87m and &euro;135m with an estimated requirement for an additional 1,600 drivers and vehicles and 650 additional School Bus Escorts. </p>  <p>  Further detailed planning is being done through the local offices on a route by route basis to plan appropriate measures to provide the additional capacity required.  As the additional capacity is rolled out, where spare capacity is created, further tickets will be allocated  to those children eligible for the scheme who have paid late and for other applicants seeking concessionary tickets.</p></reply>

The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But in order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisation process.  </p><p>These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p><p>A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p><p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade, which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p><p>The use which has been made of Junior Cycle data in the model is set out in detail in the Report of the National Standardisation Group.  Individual Junior Cycle results were not used to determine any individual&rsquo;s Calculated Grades. Rather, the Calculated Grades process took account of the overall Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and used this data to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group using related information about the relationship between performance at Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate based on national data over time for that subject at that level.  </p><p>On 30 September, I announced that two errors had been found in the Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades process. These errors related to the way in which the coding for the process utilised Junior Cycle data. </p><p>On 03 October, following a further review of the coding by an independent third party, I announced that a further error had been identified. </p><p>These three errors were rectified, and following this, a total of 6,100 students have received higher grades. These students were able to access their improved results 03 October. </p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the results, 7 September, and are available here:</p><p><i>. </i></p></reply>

These meant that incorrect grades were issued to some students when they received their results on 7 September. </p><p>The first error, in one out of 50,000 lines of code, was in relation to the processing of Junior Cycle data. The system was meant to draw on the core Junior Cycle subjects of English, Irish and Maths, and combine them with the students&rsquo; 2 best non-core subjects for all of the students in each class in each school. The coding error instead combined the core subjects with the students&rsquo; 2 weakest non-core subjects.</p><p>The error meant that, in some subjects, some students received Calculated Grades that were lower than they should have been, while some students received grades that were higher than they should have been. </p><p>In the course of a review which the Department then undertook, Departmental staff found a further error in the section of the code dealing with Junior Cycle results. The Junior Cycle subject Civil, Social and Political Education (CPSE) was meant to be disregarded as part of the model but was not. This second error, however, had a negligible impact on results.</p><p>I provided a further update on 03 October, announcing that improved Calculated Grades would issue to impacted students that day. This announcement was made following a review of essential aspects of the coding by Educational Testing Services, ETS, a non-profit organisation based in the United States. </p><p>ETS completed their review and provided it to my Department on 3 October.  The review identified one further error, relating to how the code handled cases where students did not sit all three core subjects (Irish, English and Maths) at Junior Cycle level.  </p><p>As a result of rectification of the three errors, a total of 6,100 students have received higher grades. This breaks down as follows:</p><p>5,408 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in one subject,</p><p>621 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in two subjects,</p><p>71 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in three or more subjects. </p><p>In addition to the students who received a lower grade than they should have in this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate, some students received a higher grade than they should have.  However, these students grades are not being amended and the students will not be affected.</p><p>ETS also identified an issue concerning how the algorithm used in the standardisation process treated students&rsquo; marks at the extreme ends of the marks scale (99% and over, 1% and below). However, ETS also stated that this had no material impact on the results and no student could receive a lower grade as a result of it. </p><p>Following correction of the errors the Department sent a corrected file of student results to the CAO. The CAO have identified that a little under 450 of the 6,100 students will be eligible to receive a new CAO offer. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will work with the CAO and the higher education institutions to see how these students can be facilitated to commence the course that they would, in other circumstances, have been offered in an earlier round. Any student who would have been entitled to a different offer in previous CAO rounds if they received the correct grade on 7 September will receive this offer or a deferred offer as part of the CAO Round 4 offers which are being released on 8 October 2020.</p><p>A copy of the report submitted by ETS is available on<i></i><i>.</i></p><p>On 03 October I also stated that I have asked that an independent comprehensive review of the operation of the Calculated Grades process take place when the process is complete.

It is expected that this right will be upheld by schools on foot of a parental request. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools are required to have drafted new admissions policies, for Patron approval before the 15 September 2020, and publication by the end of September 2020. The act requires where schools provide religious instruction that they clearly set out in their admission policies the school&rsquo;s arrangements for students, where the parent or in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student, has requested that the student attend the school without attending religious instruction in the school. </p>  <p>  The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned. Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc. </p>  <p>  The right of parents to have their child opt out of religion instruction and worship applies in all schools regardless of the denomination or ethos of the school concerned.</p></reply>

The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But in order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisation process.  </p><p>These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p><p>A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p><p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade, which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p><p>The use which has been made of Junior Cycle data in the model is set out in detail in the Report of the National Standardisation Group.  Individual Junior Cycle results were not used to determine any individual&rsquo;s Calculated Grades. Rather, the Calculated Grades process took account of the overall Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and used this data to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group using related information about the relationship between performance at Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate based on national data over time for that subject at that level.  </p><p>On 30 September, I announced that two errors had been found in the Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades process. These errors related to the way in which the coding for the process utilised Junior Cycle data. </p><p>On 03 October, following a further review of the coding by an independent third party, I announced that a further error had been identified. </p><p>These three errors were rectified, and following this, a total of 6,100 students have received higher grades. These students were able to access their improved results 03 October. </p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the results, 7 September, and are available here:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

The Leaving Certificate results of these students will remain unchanged as they do every year in these circumstances. </p><p>The CAO system operates on behalf of the higher education institutions solely on the basis of the Leaving Certificate results that candidates have been awarded. </p><p>Therefore, it is not appropriate for the CAO to make any differentiation within the group of candidates with the 2020 Leaving Certificate, just as the CAO cannot treat a 2019 Leaving Certificate candidate differently from a 2020 one. The CAO process for 2020 has been undertaken on that basis.</p><p>Furthermore, there has been an increase in the numbers of available places in colleges so that improved CAO offers can be made all candidates who would have been entitled to them.

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. </p><p>On 30 September, I made a statement advising that two errors had been identified in the Calculated Grades process. These meant that incorrect grades were issued to some students when they received their results on 7 September. </p><p>The first error, in one out of 50,000 lines of code, was in relation to the processing of Junior Cycle data. The system was meant to draw on the core Junior Cycle subjects of English, Irish and Maths, and combine them with the students&rsquo; 2 best non-core subjects for all of the students in each class in each school. The coding error instead combined the core subjects with the students&rsquo; 2 weakest non-core subjects.</p><p>The error meant that, in some subjects, some students received Calculated Grades that were lower than they should have been, while some students received grades that were higher than they should have been. </p><p>In the course of a review which the Department then undertook, Departmental staff found a further error in the section of the code dealing with Junior Cycle results. The Junior Cycle subject Civil, Social and Political Education (CPSE) was meant to be disregarded as part of the model but was not. This second error, however, had a negligible impact on results.</p><p>I provided a further update on 03 October, announcing that improved Calculated Grades would issue to impacted students that day. This announcement was made following a review of essential aspects of the coding by Educational Testing Services, ETS, a non-profit organisation based in the United States. </p><p>ETS completed their review and provided it to my Department on 3 October.  The review identified one further error, relating to how the code handled cases where students did not sit all three core subjects (Irish, English and Maths) at Junior Cycle level.  </p><p>As a result of rectification of the three errors, a total of 6,100 students have received higher grades. This breaks down as follows:</p><p>5,408 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in one subject,</p><p>621 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in two subjects,</p><p>71 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in three or more subjects. </p><p>In addition to the students who received a lower grade than they should have in this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate, some students received a higher grade than they should have.  However, these students grades are not being amended and the students will not be affected.</p><p>ETS also identified an issue concerning how the algorithm used in the standardisation process treated students&rsquo; marks at the extreme ends of the marks scale (99% and over, 1% and below). However, ETS also stated that this had no material impact on the results and no student could receive a lower grade as a result of it. </p><p>Following correction of the errors the Department sent a corrected file of student results to the CAO. The CAO have identified that a little under 450 of the 6,100 students will be eligible to receive a new CAO offer. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will work with the CAO and the higher education institutions to see how these students can be facilitated to commence the course that they would, in other circumstances, have been offered in an earlier round. Any student who would have been entitled to a different offer in previous CAO rounds if they received the correct grade on 7 September will receive this offer or a deferred offer as part of the CAO Round 4 offers which are being released on 8 October 2020.</p><p>A copy of the report submitted by ETS is available on <i></i>.</p><p>On 03 October I also stated that I have asked that an independent comprehensive review of the operation of the Calculated Grades process take place when the process is complete. This review will include independent international expertise.</p></reply>

Significant resources are allocated each year to ensure that appropriate supports are available for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  Children with special educational needs are supported through placement in mainstream classes, special classes and special schools. At school, they receive a range of supports provided by teachers and SNAs.  Other professional supports, including training for teachers, are provided by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to enable each school provide a holistic educational experience for each child.  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of therapeutic supports.</p>  <p>  NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally to meet identified need. This process is ongoing</p>  <p>   It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. School transport is also available. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p>  <p>  The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy includes the provision of a 4 classroom SEN base. This project is in the process of being devolved for delivery to the local Education and Training Board (ETB).</p>  <p>  The first step in this process is the execution of a Service Level Agreement between my Department and the ETB and this is being arranged.  Thereafter, the ETB will procure a Design Team for the project to design the buildings, obtain the necessary statutory planning permission and move the project onward to construction in due course.  As the project is at an early stage in the delivery process, it is not possible at this time to give a date for its completion.</p></reply>

Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s  School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 3.2kms at primary and 4.8kms at post-primary and are attending their nearest School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services in the 2020/2021 school year where such services are in operation. Children who are eligible for school transport but for whom no service is available may be offered the Remote Area Grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.   </p>  <p>  Children who apply but who are not eligible for school transport are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.</p>  <p>  Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available Bus &Eacute;ireann allocates tickets using an agreed selection process. Concessionary transport may therefore vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s primary or post primary school education cycle.  The provision of a seat on a concessionary basis in a given year does not confer any continuing entitlement for that user in following years as concessionary places are entirely contingent on there being spare seats once eligible users are provided for.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that the children referred to by the Deputy are not eligible for transport under the terms of the scheme as they are not attending their nearest school.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that the children were not successful in obtaining a ticket in the selection process for concessionary seats for the 2020/21 school year.</p></reply>

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. </p><p>On 30 September, I made a statement advising that two errors had been identified in the Calculated Grades process. These meant that incorrect grades were issued to some students when they received their results on 7 September. </p><p>The first error was identified by Polymetrika International Inc as having taken place when processing students&rsquo; data. The error, in one out of 50,000 lines of code, was in relation to the processing of Junior Cycle data. The system was meant to draw on the core Junior Cycle subjects of English, Irish and Maths, and combine them with the students&rsquo; 2 best non-core subjects for all of the students in each class in each school. The coding error instead combined the core subjects with the students&rsquo; 2 weakest non-core subjects.</p><p>The error meant that, in some subjects, some students received Calculated Grades that were lower than they should have been, while some students received grades that were higher than they should have been. </p><p>In the course of a review which the Department then undertook, Departmental staff found a further error in the section of the code dealing with Junior Cycle results. The Junior Cycle subject Civil, Social and Political Education (CPSE) was meant to be disregarded as part of the model but was not. This second error, however, had a negligible impact on results.</p><p>I provided a further update on 03 October, announcing that improved Calculated Grades would issue to impacted students that day. This announcement was made following a review of essential aspects of the coding by Educational Testing Services, ETS, a non-profit organisation based in the United States. </p><p>ETS completed their review and provided it to my Department on 3 October.  The review identified one further error, relating to how the code handled cases where students did not sit all three core subjects (Irish, English and Maths) at Junior Cycle level.  </p><p>As a result of rectification of the errors, a total of 6,100 students have received higher grades. This breaks down as follows:</p><p>5,408 studentshave received a higher grade, by one grade band, in one subject,</p><p>621 studentshave received a higher grade, by one grade band, in two subjects,</p><p>71 studentshave received a higher grade, by one grade band, in three or moresubjects. </p><p>In addition to the students who received a lower grade than they should have in this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate, some students received a higher grade than they should have.  However, these students&rsquo; grades are not being amended and the students will not be affected.</p><p>ETS also identified an issue concerning how the algorithm used in the standardisation process treated students&rsquo; marks at the extreme ends of the marks scale (99% and over, 1% and below). However, ETS also stated that this had no material impact on the results and no student could receive a lower grade as a result of it. </p><p>A copy of the report submitted by ETS is available on <i>.</i></p></reply>

A range of steps were taken to ensure adequate oversight of the Calculated Grades process.</p><p>The design of the Calculated Grades model was informed by advice from a the National Standardisation Group, comprising experts drawn from the State Examinations Commission, the Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills, the Educational Research Centre and international external expertise. The National Standardisation Group is the decision-making group responsible for the implementation of the iterative design and development cycles required to produce and refine the standardisation process and the application, review, and adjustment of the data in line with the commitments, principles, parameters and constraints associated with the calculated grades process to arrive at fair and just representations of student performance. The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group. </p><p>The purpose, role and membership of the Group, along with information on the duration of its work and the decision making, governance and oversight arrangements that would apply, were set out in the paper Establishment of a National Standardisation Group for Calculated Grades.</p><p>The aim of the National Standardisation Group was to deliver a set of calculated grades that met the objectives of being fair and accurate at the point in the iterative process at which a safe, satisfactory and defensible set of outcomes has been achieved.</p><p>Details regarding this group, including its terms of reference, membership and its decision making framework are available in the Report from the National Standardisation Group to the Independent Steering Committee and the Programme Board which is available at<i></i><i>.</i>Minutes of the meetings of this group are available at</p><p><i></i></p><p>A non-statutory Independent Steering Committee to oversee the quality and independence of the process being undertaken by the Calculated Grades Executive Office was established by me. The Steering Committee comprises six independent members appointed by me and is chaired by Dr &Aacute;ine Lawlor, former Director of the Teaching Council. The Steering Committee was established to provide assurance as to the quality and integrity of the outcomes of the Calculated Grades system. The 1st Letter of Opinion regarding the Calculated Grades System of the Independent Steering Committee can be found at: Details of the Independent Steering Committee including its membership are also available at the above link.</p><p>A Calculated Grades Programme Board provided governance and decision-making for the overall programme associated with the Calculated Grades Model and process. The Board was chaired by an Assistant Secretary General from the Department of Education and Skills and membership comprises officials from the Calculated Grades Executive Office, the wider Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p><p>In addition, Dr Janet Brown, former Chief Executive of the Scottish Qualifications Authority, was appointed to the role of External Reviewer.

My Department's budget in 2019 was over &euro;20bn, and the oversight of the C&amp;AG is essential to ensuring public confidence in the control and anti-fraud measures in place to protect the monies entrusted by the taxpayer and authorised by the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  My Department operates approximately 80 schemes and programmes. While the vast majority of payments made under these schemes are appropriate, payments in excess of entitlement can and do happen. These overpayments can arise in a number of ways, including through customer errors, official error by Department staff and through suspected fraudulent claiming of benefits.</p>  <p>My Department has published a Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy, covering the years 2019 to 2023, to ensure that a clear and strategic approach to preventing and detecting social welfare suspected fraud and error underpins the control work of the Department. The Strategy consists of 4 pillars (Prevent, Deter, Detect and Account  ) which are leveraged to ensure that suspected fraud and non-compliance in our welfare system is kept to a minimum during the lifetime of the Strategy.  </p>  <p>  Under the strategy, my Department conducts control reviews of schemes to help ensure that our customers are entitled to a payment and that the level of payment is correct. The majority of claims are selected for review based on risk analysis, including the level of expenditure and numbers of claimants on the scheme, emerging risks from analysis of schemes by the Department&rsquo;s Business Analytics Unit and risks identified from outcomes of previous control reviews on the scheme. Using this methodology allows the Department to identify both the risks with scheme operations and the steps that are necessary to address any control weaknesses. </p>  <p>  My Department also carries out Control Surveys on two schemes each year. These reviews are randomly selected and published each year and are used by the C&amp;AG to monitor suspected fraud and error rates and make recommendations where they feel controls may need to be enhanced.</p>  <p>  My Department has noted  and will implement the recommendations issued by the C&amp;AG as quickly as possible to ensure that weaknesses identified in control of payments are addressed.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

These income supports have proven to be effective in maintaining incomes and insulating people against a sudden and severe income shock. In all research and policy analyses undertaken by my Department, the impact of Covid-19 on the labour market, and the associated activation challenges, are a central consideration.</p>  <p>  My Department, in collaboration with the Central Bank of Ireland,  published a Working Paper in May  entitled &ldquo;The Initial Impacts of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Ireland&rsquo;s Labour Market&rdquo; which found that in the initial weeks of the pandemic, the most severely impacted sectors were tourism, hospitality and food, retail and construction. Moreover, those who had lost their jobs or were displaced by the pandemic, were more likely to be young, low-skilled and previously in part-time employment than the population average; reflecting the higher share of these workers in the sectors most affected.   </p>  <p>  The Labour Market Advisory Council, an expert group of academics and representatives from industry and business, was convened by my predecessor earlier this year to provide advice to Government on key employment and labour market challenges.  The first task assigned to the Advisory Council was to develop, as a matter of urgency, proposals for actions to tackle the labour market challenges arising as a result of the pandemic. A Policy Paper entitled &ldquo;Preparing for Economic Recovery&rdquo; was published by the Council in June in response to this mandate and outlines a series of recommendations for Government on the public policy and labour market responses needed to tackle current labour market challenges.  </p>  <p>  The Advisory Council recognises that there are a range of  challenges facing Ireland&rsquo;s labour market, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on particular cohorts of the labour market.  It is proposed to deal with these topics in future Policy Papers.</p>  <p>  My Department has worked with colleagues at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) to consider the impacts of the pandemic unemployment payment. Research by the ESRI, as part of their Budget Perspectives 2021 series, examined the potential cost and distributional effect of Covid-19 unemployment. It found that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme significantly softened the financial impact of Covid-19 on families and household income. </p>  <p>  The ESRI undertook a further social assessment of the impact of the introduction of the proposed new rates from September 2020 on behalf of my Department. The analysis considers the effects of the new PUP rates with reference to changes in household disposable income and the impact upon poverty rates. The results indicated that the changes resulted in a very small reduction in disposable income.</p>  <p>  With regard to long term research plans, my Department has recently awarded a new poverty and social inclusion research programme to the ESRI.  It is expected the resulting research will include analysis of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the most vulnerable in Irish society, amongst other topics.  In addition, my Department monitors independent research on areas of interest and commissions research where required.</p></reply>

This was because the Shannon premises did not meet required HSE Covid-19 health advice and the Return to Work Safely Protocol and could not offer citizens information services safely in-person.</p>  <p>  North Munster CIS which has responsibility for the CIC at Shannon is progressing plans to retrofit the existing premises to the requisite safety standards to facilitate limited face-to face appointment service for members of the public. It is understood that from next week the Shannon Centre will be in a position to facilitate some emergency in-person appointments where required.</p>  <p>  It is very important to understand that while in person appointment or drop-in services were required to close at the Shannon Business Centre &ndash; citizens information services remain open, active and available to the public in the Shannon region.  The service can be contacted by phone (at 0761 07 5370)   and by email (at shannon.cic@citinfo.ie).  Service hours are Monday to Friday 9.00am to 1.00 pm, and 2.00pm to 5.00 pm. In addition, clients who require a face to face appointment, can and have been, facilitated in the Citizen Information Centres in Ennis or Limerick. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, North Munster CIS is also engaged in a review of its service delivery points, both core offices and outreach locations, and is examining all options in the Shannon area. It is expected that this review will be completed, and a decision made on the future location of services for the Shannon area, before the end of 2020 </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

He was awarded the PUP from 3/4/2020. My Department&rsquo;s records reflect that the person concerned closed his PUP application as he was returning to work on 3/7/2020.  </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the PUP scheme in March, approximately 750,000 people have applied for payment and in some cases, they have done so on a number of occasions as they moved in and out of employment. Consequently, there are over 1 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears are due.  In order to address an issue of this scale, the Department is currently developing an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online.  Given the complexity attached to the project, it will take some time to complete the necessary work to review all cases and to determine to what extent arrears are due to individuals. The intention is that all arrears will be paid in the coming months. </p>  <p>  If arrears arise in the case of the person concerned, they will be processed and issued to him. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s records show that the person concerned submitted an application for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance on 23/09/2020.  Further documentation has been requested in order to progress this application and on receipt of this his application will be progressed.</p>  <p>  If the person concerned is experiencing financial difficulty, it is open to him to contact his local Community Welfare Service and seek assistance under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme while his application is being processed.  This service can be contacted by phone at (01) 8581100 and by Email at cwsfinglas@welfare.ie</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The objective of this commitment is to address the low proportion of employees in Ireland with supplementary pension cover, which includes both occupational and personal pensions.</p><p>The rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland is just over 50% of the working population (CSO, Pension Coverage Survey 2019) and this reduces to less than 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation.  Many of these people will become reliant on the State pension for all or most of their income in retirement and accordingly, may face a significant unwanted drop in income. </p><p>Although the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018 to 2023 provided for the development and implementation of an Automatic Enrolment (AE) retirement savings system by 2022, this Government recognises the exceptional strain that both employers and employees are now under as a result of the Covid-19 emergency.  Therefore, the Government will now seek to gradually deliver an AE system, based on the following principles: </p><p>- There will be a phased roll-out, over a decade, of the contribution made by workers. </p><p>- Matching contributions will be made by both workers and employers and the State will top up contributions. </p><p>- There will be an opt-out provision for those who choose to opt out. </p><p>- Workers will have a range of retirement savings products to choose from. </p><p>- There will be a charges cap imposed on pension providers. </p><p>A phased introduction of the system is believed to be achievable in the current situation. As part of this phased introduction, the Automatic Enrolment Programme Management Office (AEPMO), based in my Department, is currently working on developing options for Government to consider in 2021.  There are five main areas where work is ongoing so as to produce design options.  These areas relate to: </p><p>- the scope and role of a central processing authority for the system; </p><p>- the nature and functions of registered providers of savings products; </p><p>- the investment framework and funds to be offered by registered providers, including the design of the default fund and the pay-out phase; </p><p>- the design of the State financial incentive; and </p><p>- the phasing of implementation.</p><p>In progressing this work, the Department is receiving technical support from the European Commission&rsquo;s DG Reform which assists EU member states implementing administrative and institutional reforms and this support will continue to be provided next year.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Class S contributions do not provide access to short-term social insurance benefits such as illness benefit.  However, the means tested supplementary welfare allowance scheme may be available to those who are experiencing financial difficulty. </p>  <p>  Self-employed contributors have been covered for invalidity pension since December 2017.  This gives the self-employed access to a safety-net of income supports if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of a long-term illness or disability without a means test. </p>  <p>  Payment of the enhanced illness benefit in respect of COVID-19 is made to both employed and self-employed people in two very limited circumstances for a person who:</p>  <p>   (i) is diagnosed with COVID-19, or</p>  <p>  (ii) is a probable source of infection of COVID-19 and is self-isolating &ndash; such persons will have either been certified by their doctor or will have been contacted by the HSE (i.e. they are contact-traced or otherwise personally identified and advised by the HSE as being a probable source of infection).</p>  <p>  This assistance has been provided for under emergency legislation Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 and subsequent regulations.  It is provided in the interest of public health and to limit the spread of the virus.</p>  <p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to keep under review the further extension of benefits to self-employed people.  In doing this, it will take account of results of the 2017 survey of self-employed workers, which indicated that self-employed people are open to paying a higher rate of social insurance in return for additional benefits, and the actuarial review of the social insurance fund which was undertaken by KPMG.  This review found that the combined cost of introducing the invalidity, illness, jobseeker&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s benefits for class S contributions was estimated to be &euro;223 million for 2020.  Any plans to extend illness benefit to self-employed persons in other illness situations would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment. </p>  <p>  To qualify for Working Family Payment, the average total weekly family income must be below the relevant income threshold as related to the family size.  The payment is calculated as 60% of the difference between the total family income and the income threshold which applies to the family. </p>  <p>  Increases for a Qualified Child (IQCs) are paid as child-related supplements to most weekly social welfare payments in recognition of the need for greater incomes among benefit-dependent households with dependent children.  The current full rate of payment is &euro;40 per week in respect of each child over 12 years, and &euro;36 per week in respect of each child under 12 years.  These payments do not of themselves constitute a specific social welfare scheme and entitlement to the appropriate primary adult payment must be established in the first instance.</p>  <p>  While increases for qualified children are an additional payment to primary social welfare payments , working family payment is an in-work support aimed at reducing in-work poverty, and increasing the benefit of work for low income households.  It is based on household size rather than the individual ages of the children in the household.</p></reply>

The main focus of the allowance is to assist qualifying applicants to improve their educational qualifications and their prospects of gaining employment.  </p>  <p>  The BTEA has been extended as part of the July Stimulus in response to Covid-19.

Of this number, 5,823 remain in payment.</p>  <p>  The scheme provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE programme and reap the benefits of quality early years care and education. </p><p>AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending and therefore requiring no formal diagnosis.  AIM is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  </p><p>Level 1: An Inclusive Culture:This level is the critical foundation for the model. It involves fostering and embedding a strong culture of inclusion, to support all children&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme. Supports include the national inclusion policy and guidelines for ECCE, the funding of a Level 6 award programme on inclusion (LINC), the establishment of Inclusion Co-Ordinators (INCOs) in each ECCE setting, funding provided for training in inclusion for INCOs and other early learning and care practitioners. Pre-school settings employing an Inclusion Coordinator (who has graduated from the LINC Programme and has agreed to take on the role of INCO in the pre-school setting) receive an increase of &euro;2 per child per week in the rate of ECCE capitation payable to that setting.  A once-off provision for the development of Universal Design Guidelines was also included in the 2017 and 2018 budget allocation outlined below. </p><p>Level 2: Information for Parents and Providers:This level recognises the requirement of parents and pre-school providers to have clear, consistent and up to date information accessible to them regarding ECCE services and supports and this is supported through the AIM.gov.ie website and information provided by County/City Childcare Committees. </p><p>Level 3: A Qualified and Confident Workforce:This level recognises the requirement to continue developing a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children participating in the ECCE Programme. Supports include funding of Continuing Professional Development courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL). </p><p>Level 4: Expert Educational Advice and Support:This level addresses the needs of early learning and care practitioners across the country to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early learning and care (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs. This service is provided by Early Years Specialists employed by Better Start. </p><p>Level 5: Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations Capital Grant:This level recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or that some early learning and care settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE Programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some capital building works for a service. A once-off provision for AIM Inclusive Play packs was also included in the 2017 and 2018 budget allocation outlined below. </p><p>Level 6: Therapeutic Intervention  : This level provides for access to therapeutic services where they are critical to enable the child fully participate in the ECCE programme. This support is funded from the Department of Health&rsquo;s vote.  </p><p>Level 7: Additional Assistance in the Pre-School Room:AIM Level 7 provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE preschool programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).

The CAO process applications for undergraduate courses on behalf of the HEIs Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. As such, neither I nor my Department have a role in the operation of the CAO.</p>  <p>  The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups. </p>  <p>  In order to help mitigate the impact of the changes to the grading system I announced the creation of an additional 2,225 places on high-demand courses in Higher Education Institutions. These places were provided in order ensure that as many students as possible could be accommodated on a course of their choice, given the unprecedented circumstances they are facing. These additional places meant that as of Round Two 63,338 applicants have received a CAO offer, more than in any previous year.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless, there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. The changes in points depend not only on the grades received by applicants but also on the number of applicants, and the number of places available. As we are in the midst of a global pandemic and economic flux, there is more volatility than usual this year due to factors such as reduced opportunities in the economy, students seeking to defer or re-apply in subsequent years and uncertainty around students travelling internationally both to and from Ireland.</p>  <p>  I appreciate how difficult a time it has been for students and parents, but I would like to stress the range of options available both in further education and training and apprenticeships, but also in pathways in higher education. For those whose route into higher education may not be what they originally planned, once they have a place there may be a pathway back to their preferred option.</p></reply>

To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression.</p><p>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for the relevant grant awarding authority. </p><p>SUSI&rsquo;s online application process for student grant applications for the 2020/21 academic year opened on 23rd April, 2020. Further information in elation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website, <i>www.susi.ie</i>. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874.</p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, the Deputy will be aware of the recently announced &euro;168m funding package for the return to education. This package includes a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p><p>Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website <i>www.revenue.ie</i></p><p>I am conscious of the challenges faced by students regarding student accommodation this year due to financial pressures and the blended learning format of the 2020/21 academic year. Throughout the last number of months my Department has been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. My Department, in consultation with these key stakeholders will continue to monitor the situation relating to student accommodation closely.</p><p>Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached in regard to a refund.</p><p>If this is not possible, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). </p><p>I have asked our higher education institutions, where they have accommodation, to try to show flexibility in terms of its use for the coming academic year, as well as flexibility with regard to cancellations and refunds. I would hope that private providers will show the same flexibility, however it is not within the my remit to issue instruction in relation to the private rental market.</p></reply>

There is no indication that a higher proportion of student than usual are opting to defer their place to the 2021 academic year, and given the large numbers of students who have been accommodated in higher education this year it is very possible that the proportion of students reapplying to the CAO will be lower next year than in previous years.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, students who are not satisfied with their Calculated Grades have the option of sitting the Leaving Certificate exams in November, and those who achieve higher grades and receive a higher CAO offer on foot of those grades will be offered a place in their course for the 2021 academic year.

Officials from my Department are liaising with the European Commission on the detail of this commitment, and along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will travel to Greece in the coming weeks to make the arrangements for their safe passage to Ireland. </p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister O'Gorman, has also committed to relocating four unaccompanied minors from Greece into the care of Tusla.  Minister O'Gorman and his officials are working with Tusla to accelerate the arrival of additional unaccompanied refugee children from Moria, and hope to make further announcements in due course. </p>  <p>  The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established in 2015 in response to the migration crisis in central and southern Europe. Under this programme, the Government committed to accepting up to 4,000 people into the State, primarily through a combination of the EU Relocation Programme and the UNHCR's Refugee Resettlement Programme.   </p>  <p>  To date, more than 3,350 people have arrived in the State under this first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).  Most of the remaining people will arrive under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme Humanitarian Admissions Programme (IHAP).  However, these people make their own travel arrangements, and so no exact timeframe can be given for when they might arrive in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Last December, a second phase of the IRPP was announced giving a commitment to welcome a further 2,900 refugees between this year and 2023, through a combination of resettlement and community sponsorship. The refugees who are due to arrive from Greece are in addition to this number.</p>  <p>  Ireland can only accept the number of people that we are able to accommodate and support effectively. We will of course consider additional numbers as part of the EU response when we can provide the necessary support services including initial accommodation and appropriate housing once the new arrivals have received some orientation support.  The matter will continue to be kept under review.  </p></reply>

Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who joined prior to 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension at 50 years of age once they have served at least 30 years and those who joined on or after 1 April 2004 may retire on full pension at 55 years of age with 30 years service. Garda&iacute; have the option of continuing to serve until they reach 60, subject to the Garda Commissioner being satisfied that they are fully competent and available to undertake their duties.  </p><p>I have set out below the number of retirements in each of the years 2015 to 2019 and to date in 2020, as provided to me by the Garda authorities. The Deputy will note that these figures include compulsory and voluntary retirements, as well as cost neutral early retirements.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year  </th>       <th>Total Retirements  </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020* as of 30 September </td>       <td>164</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>223</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>218</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>226</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>228</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>238</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that projected departures are kept under continuous review and that the level of recruitment is adjusted as necessary in order to maintain the desired strength.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including by arranging for the recruitment and training of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters.  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 3,488 probationers have attested and been assigned to frontline policing duties nationwide, including the new probationers that attested this year.  </p><p>The resources provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2020 of &euro;1.88 billion. This level of funding is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation. There are now over 14,600 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff and these numbers are continuing to grow.  Taken together, this increase in the number of Garda members and staff is delivering a significant growth in operational policing hours nationwide.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to know that detailed information in relation to the allocation of probationer Garda&iacute;  is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: </p><p><i></i><i></i></p><p>The Deputy may also wish to know that detailed information in relation to Garda numbers, including figures for the years  2015 and up to and including 31 August 2020 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.

Very significant modernisation of the law in this area was brought about in 2015 with the enactment of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which amended extensively the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  The reforms in family law provided for in that Act recognise the crucial role of parents and the need for a child to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents.</p>  <p>  Married parents of a child are automatically joint guardians and have joint custody of their children. Where married parents separate or divorce, they can decide between themselves on custody arrangements for their children or apply to the courts to decide on the matter.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Article 42A.4 of the Constitution requires that provision be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings concerning the guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration. </p>  <p>  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in any proceedings where guardianship, custody or upbringing of, or access to, a child is in question.  Section 31 of the 1964 Act sets out a wide range of factors that the court is required to take into account when determining the best interests of the child in such proceedings.  These factors include the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with each of his or her parents.  Also required to be considered, where applicable, are proposals made for the child&rsquo;s custody, care, development and upbringing and for access to and contact with the child, having regard to the desirability of the parents or guardians of the child agreeing to such proposals and co-operating with each other in relation to them.  A further factor to be considered is the willingness and ability of each of the child&rsquo;s parents to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the child and the other parent.  The courts shall have regard to all of these factors or circumstances that it regards as being relevant to the child concerned and his or her family and make its decision accordingly.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 provides that either parent of a child, whether or not he or she is also a guardian of the child, may apply to court for a direction regarding the custody of a child or the right of access to the child.  A court may also make any necessary orders under section 11 when it is dealing with proceedings relating to divorce or judicial separation.  Section 11D of the 1964 Act obliges the court in proceedings under section 11 to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with each of his or her parents on a regular basis.  Section 25 of the 1964 Act also requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in guardianship, custody and access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  Section 12A of the 1964 Act provides that in making any order under the Act, the court may impose such conditions as it considers to be necessary in the best interests of the child.</p>  <p>  I have no role in the making of court orders in relation to guardianship, custody and access to children. This is a matter for the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions.</p>  <p>  I have recently published the General Scheme of a Family Court Bill, which provides for the establishment of a District Family Court, a Circuit Family Court and a Family High Court as divisions within the existing court structures.  The enactment of this Bill is a key commitment in the Programme for Government.  The General Scheme of the Family Court Bill aims to streamline family court processes to make them more efficient and user-friendly, while encouraging greater use of alternative dispute resolution.  The development of sensible, comprehensive and sensitive family law procedures, particularly for vulnerable families, will be central to the new system.  The proposals in the General Scheme of the Family Court Bill are a result of a broad consideration as to the best means of providing access to various family law mechanisms available to those families involved in private family law cases.</p></reply>

I have been advised by the Service that they have previous experience dealing with such committals.  </p>  <p>  Where a court makes an order committing a person to a prison, the Irish Prison Service must accept that person into custody in whichever prison is specified by the court.  All prisoners committed to Limerick Prison are accommodated in accordance with their legal gender. </p>  <p>  I am advised that, on arrival in prison, all prisoners are brought to the reception / committal unit of the prison, where there is an opportunity to provide details as part of the committal interview process.  The assessment of the prisoner&rsquo;s needs may require a Prison Governor to consider the biological gender, legal gender, gender identity, transgender, gender expression, sexual orientation or gender recognition legislation. </p>  <p>  I am, however, also informed that the Governor will also consider the risks posed including any risk to the prisoner themselves and any level of risk to other prisoners. This risk assessment will determine the regime necessary to ensure the safety of all prisoners and may include the accommodation of the prisoner on a restricted regime under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  I am further advised that in such cases the Governor may also make a recommendation on the appropriate placement within the prison system, taking into consideration good order, security and operational issues, protection issues, available accommodation and the healthcare needs of the prisoner as well as the safety and security of other prisoners and staff. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to be aware that there are number of actions contained in the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy relating to LGBTI+ prisoners. Action 13.3 commits the IPS to "develop a placement and accommodation policy to reflect and build upon existing good practice in the accommodation of vulnerable prisoners including LGBTI+ people and I understand that exploratory discussions have been held with relevant stakeholders in that regard.</p></reply>

It is recommended to hold meetings and deliver programmes online or outdoors where this is possible, without diluting the benefits for participants</p><p>2. Where it is decided to host a face-to-face group/programme meeting, organisers are advised to undertake a risk assessment to ensure the health, welfare and safety of participants</p><p>3.

The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013, on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts. </p>  <p>  In 2013, the Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly Mobility Allowance on an interim basis, to those who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the Scheme closed.  Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there were 3,831 people in receipt of the interim payments at July 2019. </p>  <p>  At the whole of Government level, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  Monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy   is being overseen by the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which comprises key Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group. </p>  <p>Under the Strategy  ,  the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport and is committed to the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  Recent developments which will impact on policy options regarding the provision of transport supports for people with a disability include the following: </p>  <p>- The ongoing progress by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in providing accessible public transport nationally   and that Department's public consultation launched on 14 November last, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport;   </p>  <p>- The Cost of Disability Study   currently underway which was commissioned by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as part of Budget 2019.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs; and </p>  <p>- The Working Group established under Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy by the Department of Justice and Equality which states that:- 'We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo;    </p>  <p>  Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners; the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p></reply>

Such procedures may be procured in both private hospitals (outsourcing), or public hospitals (insourcing). In order to ensure competitive pricing as part of their outsourcing programme, the NTPF works with private hospitals from a panel agreement and engages in procurement processes through e-tender. </p>  <p>  In relation to insourcing, a public hospital may have some spare capacity but require further funding in order to utilise it.  Such public hospitals may make a proposal to the NTPF, whereby the NTPF pay a fixed price per procedure performed. The amount paid by the NTPF meets the extra costs incurred by the public hospital in performing the additional procedures.</p>  <p>  The NTPF works with public hospitals, as opposed to with patients directly, to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. </p>  <p>  The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first. While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List. The clinical suitability of the patient to avail of NTPF funded treatment is determined by the public hospital.</p>  <p>  The availability of capacity for the specific procedure required by the patient is a factor in the selection of treatment provider, as well as the ability and willingness of the patient to travel to another hospital to avail of treatment. Patients are contacted by their referring hospital with an offer of treatment at an alternative hospital and the NTPF advises that they endeavour to accommodate patients requiring procedures in hospitals closer to home, if they are requested by the public hospital to do so.</p></reply>

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission, and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The plan is framed to account for periods when there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.</p><p>Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. The Framework was informed by expert advice and recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).</p><p>The plan seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>During this pandemic, the application of the public health advice measures to suppress the disease transmission is intended to minimise the risks to public health whilst striking the right balance in: </p><p>- prioritising some activities over others, including health and social care services, education and other essential needs.  </p><p>- protecting work and economic activity, and other key societal interests such as sports and important family gatherings, thereby allowing as much of society and business to continue as &ldquo;normally&rdquo; as possible while continuing to make every effort to suppress the virus. </p><p>.As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection. </p><p>Ireland is moving from a short-term emergency response approach to a medium-term approach to managing risk and repairing the damage that COVID-19 has inflicted on society. All counties in Ireland will be at Level 3 of the Plan for living with Covid-19 from midnight Tuesday 6 October.  At level 3, the priority is to keep all essential services open</p><p>Further information on the public health measures in currently in place at level 3 can be found at <i></i></p></reply>

The restructuring of services, social distancing measures and self-isolation can be particularly difficult for those who are trying to remain drug or alcohol free and for those who are in recovery.</p>  <p>  The Government plan for living with Covid-19 details how non-Covid health and social care services will be resumed, especially during the challenging winter months. This includes planning for the safe resumption of drug and alcohol services, including community-based services, residential programmes and recovery support groups.</p>  <p>  The Department has set up a working group with drug and alcohol service providers to develop a 'Framework for the Restoration of Drug and Alcohol Services', in a planned and appropriate manner in line with public health advice. The working group has identified issues on which guidance and supports are required. </p>  <p>  I recently met with representatives of drug and alcohol task forces to discuss continued support for their work in identifying and responding to local needs. I confirmed my approval of additional funding to support the resumption of drug and alcohol services including the adaptation of services, premises, online meetings and personal protective equipment. The details of this additional funding will be communicated to the task forces shortly. </p></reply>

These Regulations amend the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 to allow for influenza vaccination to be administered by registered pharmacists in places other than the premises of the retail pharmacy business in which they carry on their professional practice, in order to help address the public health need to increase access to the influenza vaccine.</p>  <p>  The 2020/2021 influenza vaccination season will be the 10th year that pharmacists have been permitted to provide this service to patients. Since the pharmacy vaccination service began, The pharmacy regulator, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (the PSI) have carried out a number of evaluations and a user satisfaction survey which have identified that this service is well received by the public and is provided to a high standard. </p>  <p>  It was therefore considered appropriate to build on the existing good practice and patient trust to further develop this service, in order to meet the evolving healthcare needs of the public and support the national healthcare system, particularly during this time of a pandemic and to take some of the vaccination workload off GPs. </p>  <p>  Due to the impact of COVID-19, there is a public health need to increase access to the influenza vaccine. This need can now be greatly assisted by enabling pharmacists to provide vaccination services offsite from the pharmacy premises, for those who may be cocooning, or in other at-risk groups and/or apprehensive about accessing this service directly in a pharmacy or GP surgery. This has the potential to greatly increase uptake of the influenza vaccine in all the groups, who can avail of the  vaccine free of charge  in particular those in the at-risk categories, as well as patients wishing to access this service privately. It also enables pharmacists who may be unable to provide a vaccination service on their pharmacy premises during the 2020/21 flu season, (due to requirements for social distancing/staff restraints etc.) to continue to provide this service for their patients and local community, albeit at a different, but safe location. </p>  <p>  The current training in place for the provision of vaccination services, which is accredited by the PSI, the existing suite of PSI Vaccination Guidance, in combination with the Immunisation guidelines for Ireland is comprehensive and can be applied to setting up and delivering  this service at non-pharmacy locations. Therefore, no additional accredited training for pharmacists is needed at this time.</p>  <p>  To further support this practice extension, the PSI intends to publish an additional guidance piece to support pharmacy owners, superintendent pharmacists and supervising pharmacists in planning and setting up a safe and effective vaccination service offsite from the pharmacy premises.</p>  <p>  It is not the role of the Minister for Health to set up off-site influenza vaccination clinics led by pharmacists or any other healthcare professional, rather this is demand led and arranged locally as the need arises, in lines with applicable regulatory requirements and clinical and practice guidelines.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  Under NHSS rental income is considered income for the purpose of the financial assessment, and is assessed at 80% less any allowable deductions. Allowable deductions include income tax and, therefore, any income tax arising from rental income should be deducted; other deductions include some health expenses, levies required by law to be paid, and interest on some loans in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence.</p>  <p>  Action 17 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector commits the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) to examine the treatment, under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme's financial assessment, of income from the rental of a person's principal private residence where they move into long term residential care. This government has committed to &ldquo;reform the Fair Deal scheme to incentivise renting out vacant properties&rdquo; in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently engaging with the DHLGH in this regard to examine the policy and legal implications on this issue. Any changes to the treatment of rental income under the Scheme require careful policy analysis and consideration and if changes were to be proposed primary legislation would be required to give effect to them.</p></reply>

In that context, all persons ordinarily resident in Ireland are eligible for public hospital services. In addition, patients may opt for private in-patient care in public hospitals subject to the requirement that the proportion of private activity is public hospitals should in the main be limited to 20% of total activity and private patient charges are set to recoup the cost of the hospital services provided to private patients. </p><p>Section 55 of the Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides that the HSE may make available private in-patient services to persons who do not have or have waived their eligibility to public in-patient services.  These services include accommodation, non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing staff, medicines, blood, medical and surgical supplies, radiology, diagnostics, operating theatres, laboratories, administration and support staff. It is also noted that patients opting to be treated privately must also pay the consultant fees associated with their treatment. The cost of a private patient stay is largely influenced by these staffing and operational costs rather than the room type occupied. </p><p>The statutory hospital charges under Section 55 that apply for such an episode of care is set out in the following table and depends on the category of hospital, duration of stay and whether the accommodation was provided in a single or multi-occupancy room.

However, it is just as important to recognise that some women did not have a positive experience.  We must learn from those experiences too and address the areas where improvement is required, including in post natal support services.  In that regard, the survey has informed quality improvement initiatives and each maternity hospital and Community Healthcare Organisation has now developed a quality improvement plan with clearly-defined actions to improve maternity care. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to improving women health services and am very confident that this survey will help us to deliver the safe, high quality, compassionate and responsive maternity service that the women of Ireland expect and deserve.</p></reply>

Farmers are already provided with information in relation to their TB risk, but this new report presents this in a very much more user friendly, detailed and practical form. There are no requirements whatsoever resulting from the recent TB letters.  The objective of TB Herd Test History Statements and Reports that issued recently to all cattle herd owners is to help them to reduce the risk of Bovine TB in their herds and provide sufficient information to enable farmers to make the decisions appropriate to their situation. The individual TB herd risk categorisation is not shared with other farmers nor is it compulsorily displayed on mart boards unless individual farmers wish to share their own herd&rsquo;s categorisation.

The stock was subject to high harvest rates for more than four decades, and fisheries were not managed during this time. </p>  <p>  The spawning biomass of this species is at an extremely low level, although conservation measures in recent years have had an impact in terms of stabilising the decline.  However, the recent period of stability is short compared to the longevity of the species.  The species is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to over-fishing. </p>  <p>  For 2020, there is a very limited quota available (53 tonnes for Ireland) for use only in pilot schemes designed to reduce bycatches.  Any such schemes are subject to European Commission approval and must relate to reducing bycatches of dogfish in other fisheries, i.e. the targeting of dogfish would remain prohibited.  A scheme for dogfish avoidance was explored by the Marine Institute but, following consultation with the Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), it was decided not to proceed further with a scheme taking into account how such a scheme would operate.</p>  <p>  The latest advice issued by ICES on 2 October 2020 is that there should be no targeted fisheries for dogfish in 2021 and 2022.  On the basis of the available scientific advice on the current state of the stock, there is currently no possibility of re-introducing a targeted fishery in the near future.</p></reply>

This Regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all Member States. </p><p>Two issues have now arisen</p><p>1. The new requirement under EU Law for a veterinary prescription to be issued before antiparasitic products can be dispensed and</p><p>2. The question as to whether Ireland can avail of a derogation in the Regulation which permits professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions</p><p>In relation to the first issue, since 2004 European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006/130/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.</p><p>There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019/6. However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed. In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019/6.  A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website <i>www.hpra.ie</i>.</p><p>The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019/6. Therefore, antiparasitic veterinary medicines must require a veterinary prescription before they can be dispensed from January 2022. Ireland has no national discretion on this issue.</p><p>On the second issue, there is a separate derogation in the Regulation, which allows professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions, in limited circumstances, but only if this was provided for in a Member State's national legislation prior to Regulation 2019/6 coming into force in January 2019.</p><p>Ireland's national legislation has never permitted anyone other than a veterinarian to issue a veterinary prescription. Therefore, Ireland has no national discretion to now provide for a regime which would permit Responsible Persons in Licensed Merchants or pharmacists to dispense antiparasitic veterinary medicines without a veterinary prescription issued by a veterinarian.</p><p>My Department has sought legal opinion and clarification from the EU Commission on the issue. Both responses reaffirmed my Department&rsquo;s understanding of the Regulation as outlined above.</p><p>I recognise these legislative changes will result in challenges for all impacted stakeholders. In recognition of this, my Department has established an Antiparasitic Resistance Stakeholder Group which is chaired by the Chief Veterinary Officer. Licensed Merchants and Co-Op organisations are both represented on this Group. Two meetings have been held to date and a programme of work containing over 30 antiparasitic related projects is currently underway. Risk analyses of various elements of the issues are addressed within this work programme. This group will examine all the issues related to the changed route of supply with two principal objectives</p><p>- Protecting the efficacy of antiparasitics which are critical to the Irish pasture-based production model.</p><p>- Establishing a regulatory system that is pragmatic, retains a substantive role for existing stakeholders and delivers value for money for farmers</p><p>A 5-week Public Consultation process on the Regulations, hosted by my Department, closed in late July with in excess of 100 submissions received, including from the organisation referred to by the Deputy. All submissions are being analysed by my officials and considered in the context of the implementation of the Regulation.</p><p>My Department is fully committed to working with all stakeholders in considering how best to implement the new EU Regulations on veterinary medicinal products. There is a dedicated email address allowing communications on the new Regulation: vetmedregs@agricuIture.gov.ie.</p></reply>

It will provide useful information on potential carbon sequestration by trees at farm level. This is the first iteration of such a forest carbon tool and will be available by the end of the year. </p>  <p>  The current Forestry Programme supports opportunities for carbon sequestration on the farm by providing grants and premiums for afforestation. This programme is due to end in 2020 but delays in finalising the new CAP regulations means that this will extend into 2021. Work on a new Forestry Programme is due to start in the coming months which will involve an extensive public consultation process and engagement with stakeholders across the forest sector.

My Department has responded with a specific scheme called the &lsquo;Creation of Woodlands on Public Lands&rsquo; scheme which we launched in August. As part of this scheme, Government mandated public bodies to review suitable land available for planting. The aim of this exercise is to kick- start an ambitious programme of afforestation on state-owned lands.  </p>  <p>  This innovative scheme encapsulates the multifunctional benefits that forestry can deliver for the environment, society and the economy. By encouraging the planting of native species on suitable land, public bodies will be establishing habitats rich in biodiversity while recreating a landscape that existed in Ireland thousands of years ago. These forests will exist in perpetuity and are non-commercial insofar as they exist for the benefit of the public in general. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the Climate Action Regional Offices (CARO) to assist all Local Authorities in identifying suitable sites for planting and to access the necessary funding under the scheme. The first step is for Kildare County Council to complete a landbank analysis of suitable land for planting.  The CARO together with my Department will be directly in touch with them to assist on this. </p></reply>

This Regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all Member States.</p><p>Two issues have now arisen</p><p>1. The new requirement under EU Law for a veterinary prescription to be issued before antiparasitic products can be dispensed and</p><p>2. The question as to whether Ireland can avail of a derogation in the Regulation which permits professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions</p><p>In relation to the first issue, since 2004 European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, such as antiparasitics, were retained as non-prescription under EU Directive 2005/130/EC. </p><p>There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019/6. However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed. In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019/6.  A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website <i>www.hpra.ie</i>.</p><p>The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019/6. Therefore, antiparasitic veterinary medicines must require a veterinary prescription before they can be dispensed from January 2022. Ireland has no national discretion on this issue.</p><p>This means that all current stakeholders that are already permitted to supply such products will be entitled to continue to supply them in the future (but from January 2022, a veterinary prescription will be needed to dispense them).</p><p>On the second issue, there is a separate derogation in the Regulation, which allows professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions, in limited circumstances, but only if this was provided for in a Member State's national legislation prior to Regulation 2019/6 coming into force in January 2019.</p><p>Ireland's national legislation has never permitted anyone other than a veterinarian to issue a veterinary prescription. Therefore, Ireland has no national discretion to now provide for a regime which would permit Responsible Persons in Licensed Merchants or pharmacists to dispense antiparasitic veterinary medicines without a veterinary prescription issued by a veterinarian.</p><p>I recognise these legislative changes will result in challenges for all impacted stakeholders. In recognition of this, my Department has established an Antiparasitic Resistance Stakeholder Group chaired by the Chief Veterinary Officer. Two meetings have been held to date and a programme of work containing over 30 antiparasitic related projects is currently underway. This group will examine all the issues related to the changed route of supply with two principal objectives</p><p>- Protecting the efficacy of antiparasitics which are critical to the Irish pasture-based production model.</p><p>- Establishing a regulatory system that is pragmatic, retains a substantive role for existing stakeholders and delivers value for money for farmers</p><p>My Department is fully committed to working with all stakeholders in considering how best to implement the new EU Regulations on veterinary medicinal products. There is a dedicated email address allowing communications on the new Regulation: vetmedregs@agricuIture.gov.ie.</p></reply>
