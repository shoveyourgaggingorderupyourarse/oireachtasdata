The policy sets out a framework to facilitate and resource each town to chart their own future through a tailored plan, developed by a collaborative Town Team, and supported by their Local Authority.</p>  <p>  The policy is underpinned by significant levels of public investment spread across major Government schemes such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), Cro&iacute; Conaithe (Towns) Fund and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Policy will assist each town, through a Town Team supported by the Local Authority, to design, develop and implement a plan to make their towns more vibrant and attractive places to live and work. This could include the development of accessible and safe public spaces in the respective towns. The regeneration of our public spaces is identified as a key opportunity in the Town Centre First Policy.</p>  <p>  A National Town Centre First Office, supported by a network of Town Regeneration Officers,  will drive the delivery of many of the recommendations outlined in the policy and support the co-ordinated roll-out of the policy by Local Authorities and Town Teams.  </p>  <p>  I am confident that this new Town Centre First approach will have hugely positive impacts on towns across rural Ireland.</p></reply>

Each Local Authority has been provided with guidance as regards the contents of the Plans, which aligns with the details outlined in the Town Centre First policy.</p>  <p>  The Town Centre First Plans should be developed collaboratively with local Town Teams involving community and business, as well as public and private stakeholders. It is envisaged that the Plans will cover the importance of &ldquo;place-making&rdquo;, town centre living, and the social and economic purpose of the town. They should respond to emerging opportunities such as those linked to remote working, climate action and digitalisation. The Plans will also be central to addressing vacancy and dereliction in these locations. </p>  <p>  In addition to developing the plan, the funding can be used to cover any underlying analysis that must be undertaken to inform the development of the plan, capacity building required locally for the Town Team, or the initial delivery of some small interventions in the town, where the budget allows. </p>  <p>  Local authorities have been requested to develop and finalise plans, and to utilise funding, within 18 months.</p></reply>

This reflects the important contribution which the scheme makes to connectivity in rural Ireland. The LIS supports the improvement of rural roads and laneways that are not normally maintained by local authorities. </p>  <p>  The Local Improvement Scheme was reintroduced in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding.  Since then my Department has allocated &euro;80 million towards improvement works on over 3,000 non-public roads and lanes. These works have benefited over 13,300 landowners and residents in these rural areas.</p>  <p>  I launched the 2021 Scheme with an initial budget of &euro;10.5 million. I was very pleased to source additional funding during the year and allocated a further round of funding to bring the total for 2021 to &euro;21 million.</p>  <p>  I was also pleased, as part of Budget 2022 to announce an increase in the base funding for LIS from &euro;10.5 million to &euro;11 million for this year. I will be launching this year's scheme in the coming weeks at which point individual county council allocations will be made known.</p>  <p>  I have continued to actively engage with my colleague, Minister Ryan, to explore the potential for further financial support for LIS from his Department. While I accept that his Department's priority at the moment remains the upkeep and maintenance of national and local public roads, I believe a cross- Government approach might reap dividends in tackling the backlog of applications on hand in local authorities. I will continue to pursue this with Minister Ryan.  </p></reply>

It contains 33 actions which collectively will support towns to deliver on their potential in a planned way.</p>  <p>  The policy commits to developing a national Toolkit to support the implementation of the Town Centre First policy by providing a range of examples of best practice and available resources to guide implementation. The toolkit will encompass specific strands targeting key areas such as enterprise development, the social and cultural functions of towns, digitalisation and climate action. </p>  <p>  It will include a national scaled-up Health Check Model to help us understand our towns better and inform the planned actions in each town. It will also include a best practice model for developing Town Centre First Plans. </p>  <p>  The Toolkit will also incorporate an online Town Centre First Web Portal to share all of this information, including all aspects of the Toolkit, and to provide access to available funding supports. </p>  <p>  I expect this will include all of the relevant supports available across Government, including the schemes referred to by the Deputy. It is vital that towns and their Town Teams have full sight of, and access to, the substantial funding and support available nationally. </p>  <p>  The Toolkit  will be developed by the National Town Centre First Office which is currently being established.  </p></reply>

Indeed, I am delighted with the interest shown in the most recent tranche of the scheme, with 191 project applications submitted from around the country.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in Our Rural Future, the current scheme prioritises the renovation of derelict and vacant buildings in our town centres, with a view to bringing these buildings back into use. The scale of projects eligible under the scheme has also increased with funding of up to &euro;500,000 now available.</p>  <p>  The assessment of the applications made under the most recent tranche of the scheme is now being finalised and I expect to be in a position to announce the successful projects very shortly. I also expect that a large number of the successful projects will be those that address the issue of vacancy and dereliction. </p>  <p>  I was delighted to secure increased funding across the range of rural development schemes in Budget 2022, and my officials are currently working on the follow up Town and Village Renewal Scheme for 2022. </p>  <p>  While the details are still being finalised, there is no doubt that we will again be prioritising projects that bring vacant and derelict buildings back into use and promote residential occupancy in town centres.  I will be announcing the details of the 2022 scheme in the coming months. </p>  <p>  I have also recently launched the new Town Centre First Policy, which includes a focus on vacancy and dereliction in towns.  This new policy will align with a range of funding sources such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund , the Rural Regeneration Development Fund, and the Urban Regeneration Development Fund. </p></reply>

The assessment of applications is undertaken by my Department under the oversight of the Project Advisory Board, which includes representatives from other Government Departments as well as independent experts.  Once that process is complete, my Department prepares a report setting out recommended projects and my role as Minister is to consider that report and make final decisions in relation to the allocation of funding. On 6th January 2022, I announced that 27 projects had been successful under this call and approved &euro;21.5m in development funding for the projects. Feedback from my officials to those who submitted applications is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Amongst the unsuccessful applications was the Tipperary Town Revitalisation Phase I project submitted by Tipperary County Council.  I understand an official from my Department has engaged with officials from the council, and met with the council and Tipperary Town Task Force representatives to provide feedback on the aforementioned application.</p>  <p>  I announced the fourth call for Category 1 applications in December 2021. An application form and guidance document is available on my Department&rsquo;s website for those seeking further information. It is important that prospective applicants carefully consider the guidance issued as part of the call for applications to ensure that their proposal is in alignment with the stated focus of the call and the objectives of the Fund. My Department will also liaise with prospective applicants to provide further guidance as necessary.</p></reply>

Many of my Department's policies and funding programmes aim to address isolation issues in communities, and also deliver benefits by responding to the challenges facing vulnerable individuals due to COVID-19. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide funding to tackle isolation and support those in our communities in most need of assistance through schemes such as the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP), the Community Services Programme, the CL&Aacute;R Programme, the Community Enhancement Programme, and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Community Services Programme (CSP) currently supports over 420 community organisations to provide employment opportunities and local services through a social enterprise model.  The CSP focuses on communities where public and private sector services are lacking, either through geographical or social isolation or because demand levels are not sufficient.  </p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for the Seniors Alert Scheme which encourages community support for vulnerable older people in our communities through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable them to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind. Funding is available under the Scheme towards the purchase by a registered community-based organisation of a personal alarm or pendant.</p>  <p>  Amongst the measures which will further support people living in rural areas is the rollout of the nationwide Public BCP Network.  These community hubs will enable onsite access to digital services including digital skills training, remote work and study, community development activities and a range of arts, culture and social events. </p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for a number of national policies containing measures to improve the lives of people throughout the country including Our Rural Future, which places an emphasis on building resilience and enhancing participation and inclusion in rural communities including older people and those with disabilities.   </p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a National Islands Policy and has undertaken a wide consultation process including public consultation on the islands to hear first-hand the challenges they face and how the Department can address these.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to monitor issues impacting on communities in order to respond to emerging needs.  </p></reply>

The platform offers booking and hub management applications to network members. </p>  <p>  To date, approximately &euro;100m has been provided by my Department through various funding streams to support the development of digital hubs and remote working facilities across Ireland. The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF) and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme both support the establishment of digital hubs. Under last year's schemes, projects that bring vacant properties in town centres back into use as remote working hubs were eligible for funding. The repurposing of existing community or publicly owned buildings in town or village centres to facilitate remote working were also eligible application themes.</p>  <p>  Last year I awarded almost &euro;9 million in funding through the Connected Hubs funding stream to more than 100 successful applicants across the country. The Connected Hubs call was open to all hubs irrespective of where they were in the country. In making decisions around the allocation of funds, the Department took into account the number of applications from urban and rural locations. This allowed for additional capacity to be added to digital hubs and broadband connection points  throughout the country. A list of successful applicants is available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  To date our focus has been to develop this critical mass - the focus will now shift to raising awareness of the network to relevant stakeholders, including SMEs/business owners and new hub users.</p>  <p>  Consultations are ongoing with hub managers across the country in developing the future strategic direction of the National Hub Network. With  a Connected Hubs marketing campaign currently in the final stages of development and  coinciding with the return to the office, it is expected that these events will have a positive effect on the uptake of remote working from hub facilities. </p>  <p>  The development of a National Hubs Network is a key commitment in Our Rural Future and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the ongoing development of a comprehensive and integrated network of remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role that they can play in our post-Covid recovery. </p></reply>

These priorities include improving mobile phone coverage in rural areas, examining issues around planning permissions and licencing for, and sharing of, telecoms infrastructure, the use of public assets for telecoms purposes and improving the quality and availability of information for consumers of telecoms services and products.</p>  <p>  Following presentations on the policy context from senior officials from both my department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, a roundtable discussion was held and Taskforce members were invited to set out the actions that each believe are necessary to improve telecommunications services in the state in the short, medium and long term.</p>  <p>  On foot of that initial meeting, a series of bilateral discussions has occurred with the relevant state bodies and with representatives of the telecommunications industry. These bilateral meetings have raised a number of important issues that will be considered in the context of formulating the work programme of the Taskforce.</p>  <p>  It is my preference that the Taskforce will meet in the first quarter of this year. At this meeting the terms of reference and a work programme will be tabled by officials. Specific responsibilities will be assigned to Taskforce members and delivery timelines will be agreed.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Taskforce is not responsible for the delivery of the National Broadband Plan (NBP).  However, the Taskforce is responsible for ensuring that, where barriers within the state&rsquo;s control are identified, a clear assessment is made and that action is taken. This will benefit the roll out of the NBP and also support the deployment of high quality networks by other operators across the state providing fixed and mobile data and telephony services.</p>  <p>  Minister Smyth and I have been clear.  We acknowledge that there are challenges that will take time to resolve, but there is more that can be done now to improve services and we have challenged government departments, agencies and the commercial sector to propose creative, workable solutions.</p></reply>

The largest of these towns include the five Regional Growth Centres of Athlone, Drogheda, Dundalk, Letterkenny and Sligo identified in the National Planning Framework (NPF). The remaining towns can be divided into Medium-Large Towns of 5,000-20,000 population and Small Towns in the category of 400 to 5,000 population.

Some 26 towns have already been allocated funding of &euro;1000,000 to produce their Town Centre First Plans, including Carrickmacross in Monaghan. Additional towns will be supported to develop plans as the policy is rolled out.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the actions in these plans will be underpinned by significant levels of public investment spread across major Government schemes such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF), the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF), the Cro&iacute; Conaithe (Towns) Fund and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. This will include funding through these schemes to address the regeneration of vacant and derelict buildings as identified in the Town Centre First plans. </p>  <p>  The policy includes a range of other actions to embed the Town Centre First process nationally and support towns such as those referred to by the Deputy. This includes funding for new Town Regeneration Officers who will support Town Teams and local stakeholders to implement Town Centre First and tackle vacancy and dereliction challenges. </p>  <p>  The  local Town Team drawn from local community and business representatives will  work with local stakeholders to progress drafting of the plans and to identify challenges, actions and integrated responses across a number of themes (business/commercial; community/cultural; housing; built environment; heritage). A key area of focus will be on vacant and derelict buildings. </p></reply>

This is with a view to determining whether a more consistent, timely  and rigorous approach to data collection might be employed across the local authority system to underpin the Scheme and inform allocations to  each county.</p></reply>

The TROs will be appointed in local authorities to drive the implementation of Town Centre First. Town Regeneration Officers will be crucial to managing the implementation of the policy at a local level and ensuring the development and implementation of Town Centre First plans. The role of the Town Regeneration Officers is outlined in Appendix 6 of the policy and includes supporting and building the capacity of the Town Teams.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to secure additional funding for of &euro;2 million for these posts in Budget 2022. As a result, it is envisaged that a Town Regeneration Officer will be appointed in local authority areas across the country.  The officers will be responsible for delivery of the Town Centre First policy across the local authority area rather than being assigned solely to an individual town. Given the focus of the policy on the regeneration of our towns, it is not envisaged at this time that such officers will be appointed in respect of the five city metropolitan areas. These areas will, of course, continue to be supported through funding under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund delivered by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></reply>

Under last year's schemes, projects that bring vacant properties in town centres back into use as remote working hubs were eligible for funding. The repurposing of existing community or publicly owned buildings in town or village centres to facilitate remote working were also eligible application themes.</p><p>Last year I awarded almost &euro;9 million in funding through the Connected Hubs funding stream to more than 100 applicants from all across the country. Over &euro;319,000 of this funding was awarded to projects in Wexford, and a list of successful applicants is available on my Department's website. </p><p>My Department also supports the development of the Connected Hubs Network - www.connectedhubs.ie, The National network offers a suite of booking and hub management applications to its members. The Network will also facilitate the sharing of innovation, experience and best practices across the community. These supports will serve to maximise benefit to member hubs, hub clients, employers, local communities and the wider economy. There are currently 189 hubs live on the platform, with this number growing every week.</p><p>The development of a national hubs network is a key commitment in Our Rural Future and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the strategic development of remote working hubs in recognition of the vital role that they can play as key economic assets in our post-Covid recovery.  </p></reply>

For the 7 year programming period from 2021 to 2027 this funding allocation will be maintained. It is comprised of &euro;70m provided for the transitional period from 2021 to 2022, and the recently announced indicative allocation of &euro;180m for the period 2023 to 2027. The maintenance of the &euro;250m funding from the 2014-2020 period is evidence of the Government's continued support for the LEADER programme.</p>  <p>  Any discussion of rural development investment must also take account of the record levels of investment in recent years.  A range of schemes have been implemented in recent years, such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Walks Scheme, and the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also saw increases secured across all my Department's rural schemes and the National Development Plan outlines a clear commitment to a continuation of investment in Rural Ireland as a matter of priority. Capital funding allocations for my Department have seen an increase from &euro;88m in 2018 to &euro;205m in 2025 under the NDP.</p>  <p>  This increased funding will help to deliver on the range of actions for our rural communities into the future as set out in the Government&rsquo;s ambitious Rural Development Policy - Our Rural Future.</p></reply>

In addition, the issue of outdated alcohol licensing legislation was a key challenge identified by stakeholders in the published report of the <i>Night-Time Economy Taskforce</i>.</p><p>I intend to modernise alcohol licensing laws by bringing forward a Sale of Alcohol bill.</p><p>Last September, the government agreed that Heads of a General Scheme of a Bill would be prepared to modernise our licensing law and I am prioritising this work at present. </p><p>Existing legislation, some of which dates to 1833, does not reflect the dynamic and diverse society that we have become. I intend that the outdated Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018 and the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008 will be repealed and replaced with updated and streamlined provisions more suited to the 21st century. It is also the intention to repeal the Public Dance Hall Act 1935.</p><p>I am happy to say that work on the consolidation and reform of the licensing laws and the drafting of the General Scheme is advancing well.  Obviously this is a reform on which there are many views across society and the legislation I bring forward needs to be informed by those views.  So, in November last, I launched a wide ranging consultation to seek the views of the public on the modernisation of Ireland&rsquo;s licencing laws. The consultation, which ran until 21 January this year, looked at how best to update the existing laws governing the sale and regulation of alcohol in Ireland.  I am pleased to say that there was a very high level of public engagement with more than 5,000 responses received, which I think speaks to the importance of this issue and the range of views in society at large including regarding the societal harms that can result from abuse of alcohol. My Department is now reviewing these responses to ensure the legislation takes account of this engagement and will also host a webinar in early March to give an opportunity for further discussion.  </p><p>I intend to progress this legislation in the months ahead with a view to enacting it this year. I look forward to working with members of this House to bring about this important reform.</p></reply>

As I have stated, there has been a 66% reduction in residential burglaries when comparing 2021 to 2015, the year in which Operation Thor commenced. </p>  <p>  Provisional crime figures for 2021, issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last month, further reported that residential burglary was down 18% last year compared to 2020, while aggravated burglary was down by 20% and robbery from the person by 22%.</p>  <p>  It is also important to acknowledge that while people aged over the age of 65 are the least likely to be the victims of crime, they are the most likely to be understandably worried or fearful about becoming a victim. I believe it is important that all of us in this House provide reassurance to those living in our communities that both the Government and Garda&iacute; are taking a wide range of steps to tackle all forms of rural crime.</p>  <p>  In addition to the very effective actions being taken by Garda&iacute; under Operation Thor, there is a wide range of other initiatives which are being taken to ensure community safety in rural areas. These include the Older People Registers maintained at many Garda stations, Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch schemes, Text Alert, Community CCTV, the Bogus Caller Initiative and the Senior Alert Scheme, amongst many others.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Garda Community Engagement Bureau promotes &lsquo;Supporting Safer Communities&rsquo; campaigns each year. The main focus of the crime prevention campaigns is burglary prevention and reduction. The National Crime Prevention Unit at Garda Community Engagement Bureau also supports a nationwide network of Crime Prevention Officers, with each Garda division having an appointed Crime Prevention Officer.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is currently developing a new community safety policy, central to which is the importance of ensuring the local communities in which people live and work both are safe and, importantly, feel safe. A key part of this policy is the establishment of new Local Community Safety Partnerships, which will be established in every local authority area under the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. The Partnerships will provide a forum for local communities to assess their specific local needs of their community and to establish Local Community Safety Plans to tackle them. Pilot partnerships are currently in place in Longford, Waterford and north inner city Dublin and will run for two years ahead of the nationwide rollout.</p></reply>

Rather, it will be best achieved as a &lsquo;whole of government&rsquo; responsibility, with Departments and agencies responsible for health and social services, education authorities and local authorities, the Garda&iacute; and the wider community working together.</p>  <p>  The new Bill will achieve this by establishing innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs) to develop local safety plans, tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves. The LCSPs will replace and build upon the existing Joint Policing Committees and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns.</p>  <p>  Each Partnership will devise and oversee a Local Community Safety Plan, which will be informed by the community itself. Membership of the Partnerships will be broader than that of the existing JPCs and will include residents, community representatives (including youth, new communities and voluntary sector representation), business and education sector representation, relevant public services including the HSE, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and local authorities as well as local councillors.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in November 2020, I announced the establishment of three Local Community Safety Partnerships on a pilot basis in the north inner city of Dublin, Waterford and Longford. The locations of the pilots, which will run for 24 months, were chosen based on a number of factors including population density, crime rates and deprivation. An independent Chairperson has been appointed to chair each Partnership pilot and I am deeply grateful to them for their public service.</p>  <p>  As the pilots progress, they will be carefully evaluated and any necessary changes made to ensure the Partnerships work as effectively as possible for the communities involved. The pilots will inform the further development of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which will facilitate the rollout of Local Community Safety Partnerships in every local authority area. </p>  <p>  The role of the LCSPs seeks to build on the good work done by Joint Policing Committee, but through an evolution and expansion of that structure. The LCSP will bring a broader focus to community safety issues, of which policing is but one factor, to enable communities to be safe and feel safe. </p></reply>

The purpose of this exercise is to advise as to whether any further investigation or inquiry beyond those already carried out is necessary and, if so, to advise on the form of such investigation or inquiry and its terms of reference.</p>  <p>  My Department maintains regular contact with the Judge and has assured him that any assistance he requires to complete his final report will be made available.

This includes the deployment of Garda members throughout the State. </p><p>I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to them, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p><p>The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation in excess of &euro;2 billion for 2022, which includes funding for the recruitment of up to 800 additional Garda trainees and up to 400 Garda staff. This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe, including in Co. Carlow, and to preventing crime in all its forms. </p><p>I can inform the Deputy that as at 31 January 2022, the latest date for which figures are available, there are 114 Garda members assigned to Garda Stations in County Carlow, an increase of approximately 7.5% per cent since the end of 2015, when there were 106 Garda&iacute; assigned to Carlow Garda Stations. In addition, as at 31 December 2021, there are 14 civilian staff.</p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, Garda numbers nationwide can be affected by a number of factors, including retirements, medical discharges and resignations.

Applications will be accepted for six months until 31 July, when the scheme will close.  The scheme includes a parallel strand, which opened for applications on 7 February 2022, to implement the recommendation included in the report of the Expert Advisory Group, allowing international protection applicants who have an outstanding application for international protection and have been in the asylum process for a minimum of 2 years to apply.  </p>  <p>  This once-in-a-generation scheme is designed to give long-term undocumented people without a current permission to remain in the State, the chance to regularise their status, access the labour market and begin their path to citizenship.  As the Deputy will be aware, it has been widely welcomed by those who have long campaigned for this right.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that almost 2,200 applications have been received up to 16 February. This is a very positive start and I encourage anyone who may be eligible to apply.  </p>  <p>  My Department has designed the criteria and application form to be as simple and clear as possible. A suite of supporting materials including a useful Frequently Asked Questions document; guidance material for making an application either as a family or an individual; a demonstration video of the online application system; and a required documents guide have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website and translated into a number of languages. Therefore, it is possible for people to be reasonably certain whether or not they will qualify for the scheme prior to making an application.  My Department is engaging with embassies and NGOs with a view to informing as many eligible people as possible.  </p>  <p>  There is also an appeals process, in which unsuccessful applications will be reviewed by another officer. If a person does not wish to appeal, or if their appeal is also unsuccessful, they will be referred for further consideration of their case by my Department, in accordance with relevant domestic immigration law and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  I would stress to the Deputy that, in assessing eligibility for both strands of the scheme, applicants must meet standards regarding good character and criminal record/behaviour and not pose a threat to the State. Having convictions for minor offences will not, of itself, result in disqualification but anyone who is the subject of serious concerns will not be eligible for regularisation in the interests of public safety.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau adopted a very humane approach to the enforcement of deportation orders during the pandemic. During this time, no orders were enforced except in cases where an individual would be considered a threat to national security or whose presence in Ireland would be contrary to the public interest. </p>  <p>  However, with the lifting of public health restrictions and a return to more normal travel, it must be acknowledged that those who do not have a legal right to remain in this country, have a duty to return to their own country, following fair procedure and having gone through all available avenues for appeal. Many people already do this voluntarily and are assisted by my Department and other organisations, like the International Organization for Migration, where appropriate.</p></reply>

This includes responsibility for the recruitment, training and deployment of Garda members and members of the Garda Reserve. As Minister, I have no responsibility in these matters.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner recently published the Garda Reserve Strategy, which has a focus on how to make best use of the Reserve and includes a commitment regarding future recruitment of the Reserve. The first strategic objective of the Garda Reserve Strategy 2021-2025 is to recruit Reserve Garda&iacute; on an initial five year tenure, while both eliminating perceived barriers and promoting inclusive recruitment. </p>  <p>  I am informed that preparatory work is ongoing by management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for an upcoming recruitment competition to the Reserve. I understand An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also set up an internal working group to review the legislative and policy requirements around the Reserve ahead of this competition.</p>  <p>  It is currently anticipated that a Garda Reserve recruitment process will be launched later in 2022, predicated upon agreement with the Public Appointments Service as to the timeframe. </p>  <p>  Consideration will clearly have to be given as part of the process to ensuring that the Reserve can serve as a pathway to future recruitment competitions for Garda members, where individuals have a desire to progress to that position.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, last week An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced their new recruitment campaign for Garda members. I would urge anyone who wants to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for a position in the service but I would particularly urge women, members of new Irish communities and people from minority groups to consider a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Both the Government and the Garda Commissioner are committed to increasing diversity within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ensuring that all communities can see themselves reflected in our police service. Budget 2022 has provided for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; and 400 Garda staff this year and many of the 800 Garda&iacute; to be recruited will be drawn from this competition.</p></reply>

The Taskforce is independently chaired by former Minister Kathleen Lynch.  </p>  <p>  The Taskforce has already had eight plenary meetings and has established three subgroups on 1) diversion, 2) capacity issues in the Prison Service and National Forensic Mental Health Services, and 3) community issues, including care after release.

A person convicted of such an offence on indictment would be liable to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or to both.</p>  <p>  Any such offences under these Acts would be a policing matter for an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

I can assure the Deputy that there will be no let-up in the pressure being brought to bear on those involved in organised crime.</p>  <p>  The Government has supported An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing the threat from organised crime gangs through the introduction of legislative measures such as:</p>  <p>  - The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 which provides additional Garda powers for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of.  </p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 providing for the establishment and operation of the DNA database providing Garda&iacute; with links between people and unsolved crimes.</p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, introduced to protect the justice system from being subverted by criminal groups, including potential intimidation of juries. </p>  <p>  - By continuing to grow the strength of the Garda organisation, with a budget of over &euro;2 billion in 2022, providing for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; and 400 Garda staff this year. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the presiding Judge, who is independent in the exercise of his or her judicial functions. There is also a constitutional presumption in favour of the grant of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, a referendum took place in 1996 on a proposed amendment to the Constitution to allow the courts to refuse bail where there are grounds for believing that the accused will commit serious offences while on bail. The referendum was passed by the People and section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is considered by the Court necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Subsequent to this, the law on bail has been further strengthened on three occasions, specifically in the Criminal Justice Act 2007, the Criminal Justice Act 2015 and the Criminal Justice Act 2017.    </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the amended bail laws have proven to be effective and I can inform the Deputy there are no immediate plans to introduce further bail legislation. </p>  <p>  In terms of future legislation the Deputy may wish to note that it is my intention in the forthcoming Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to raise the maximum penalty for the offence of &lsquo;conspiracy to murder&rsquo; from a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment to potential life imprisonment. This bill is currently with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and I hope to be in a position to publish it in quarter 2 of this year.</p></reply>

However, at all times and during all levels of restrictions, my Department has continued to accept and process citizenship applications.  There are currently 3,038 citizenship applications for minors being processed by my Department. The majority of these are more than 12 months in the system. </p>  <p>  Some cases are unfortunately taking more than 24 months to process. My Department's objective is to achieve a significantly improved decision making timeframe of 6-9 months for a majority of applications during this year. My Department has introduced a number of changes to help speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to support applicants and increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. </p>  <p>  A particularly useful change that has been welcomed by applicants is that since the beginning of this year, all applicants, including minors, are no longer required to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour certified copy. A points-based scoring system for proofs of residence has also been introduced to assist applicants and ensure that submitted applications are complete.  </p>  <p>  My Department has identified that approximately 20% of the 25,000 applications currently in the system are incomplete, with further action required by the applicant to progress the application. From the end of March, if there is no further engagement with my Department, these applications will be deemed ineligible and returned to the applicant. This will allow my officials to focus resources on processing complete applications and ensure that decisions are delivered more quickly for those applicants. </p>  <p>  The aim of the steps taken is to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  As an early indication of the success of these measures, my Department made more than 11,500 citizenship decisions last year, which is the highest level since 2015.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that it is my intention to hold an in-person citizenship ceremony this June, public health permitting.</p></reply>

The role is to proactively, via intelligence led investigations, target top tier Organised Crime Groups (OCGs) impacting on this jurisdiction. </p><p>The role of the GNDOCB is achieved through effective collaboration with all sections of Organised &amp;amp; Serious Crime, and other sections within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through partnerships with other law enforcement agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Naval Service, and partnerships developed with international law enforcement agencies globally. </p><p>The international resources and expertise available via Europol and Interpol, in particular, enhance intelligence led investigations conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, ensuring access to international standard capabilities. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the GNDOCB engages in two Joint Investigations Teams (JITs) with international partners as well as a number of parallel investigations with regard to criminal organisations impacting on this jurisdiction.</p><p>The current network of Garda Liaison Officers (GLO) and foreign law enforcement Liaison Officers further extends An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's outreach to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute OCG&rsquo;s internationally. I am advised that in 2021, the Garda Liaison network was expanded to include a GLO permanently based in Colombia with responsibility to cover the Southern Americas. </p><p>Since it was established, GNDOCB has had significant successes in tackling organised crime. GNDOCB have been responsible for the seizure of large quantities of controlled substances, cash, firearms, and ammunition. It has also been responsible for bringing numerous suspected offenders before the courts for offences relative to organised crime (directing and participating in activities of a criminal organisation), drug trafficking, firearms, and money laundering.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware that Operation Tara was commenced in July 2021 and is focused on disrupting, dismantling and prosecuting drug trafficking networks that impact on communities, and is under the strategic oversight of Assistant Commissioner, Organised &amp;amp; Serious Crime. I am advised that this focus will continue into 2022 by maximising the prospect of identifying criminal organisations, offenders, locations and activities in the State via data analysis. This will result in an increase for opportunity to seize drugs, criminally acquired assets, and initiate criminal proceedings.</p><p>Further, Operation Thor is an anti-crime strategy that is under the strategic oversight of Assistant Commissioner, Organised &amp;amp; Serious Crime, which commenced in November 2015, with the focus of preventing burglaries and associated criminal activity. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current winter phase, which is designed to tackle any anticipated increase in burglaries and associated criminal activities in the winter months, was launched on 1 October 2021 and will continue until 31 March 2022.</p></reply>

This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe, and to preventing crime in all its forms. </p><p>I can confirm that at 31 January 2022  there were 298 Garda&iacute; assigned to Roscommon/Longford Division of whom 92 were assigned to Longford District. </p><p>The table at the following link, which has been provided to me by the Garda authorities, shows the number of Garda&iacute; attached to the Roscommon/Longford Division at 31 January 2022. </p><p>">Garda Assignments</p><p>Detailed information in relation to Garda numbers is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  This information is updated every month with the latest data provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and includes the number of Garda&iacute; by station across the whole country.</p><p>The information can be found at the following link: www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/An_Garda_Siochana_facts_and_figures</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Longford is one of three areas in the pilot scheme for Local Community Safety Partnerships, alongside Dublin's North Inner City and Waterford. The Longford pilot is chaired by Ms Martina Maloney. These new structures are designed to take a holistic approach to safety issues in partnership with the community. They operate at local authority administrative level and will be made up of local representatives, a range of local services, community representatives and residents. Each Partnership will devise a Local Community Safety Plan to address the specific needs of their community. The pilot scheme is scheduled to run for two years and will inform a national rollout to all local authority areas. </p></reply>

Tusla&rsquo;s review will inform future investments in DSGBV facilities and services.</p>  <p>  At present, the time taken from initiation to the delivery of units can taken a number of years.

Rather, it will be best achieved as a &lsquo;whole of government&rsquo; responsibility, with Departments and agencies responsible for health and social services, education authorities and local authorities, the Garda&iacute; and the wider community working together.</p>  <p>  The new Bill will achieve this by establishing innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs) to develop local safety plans, tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves. The LCSPs will replace and build upon the existing Joint Policing Committees and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns.</p>  <p>  Each Partnership will devise and oversee a Local Community Safety Plan, which will be informed by the community itself. Membership of the Partnerships will be broader than that of the existing JPCs and will include residents, community representatives (including youth, new communities and voluntary sector representation), business and education sector representation, relevant public services including the HSE, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and local authorities as well as local councillors.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in November 2020, I announced the establishment of three Local Community Safety Partnerships on a pilot basis in the north inner city of Dublin, Waterford and Longford. The locations of the pilots, which will run for 24 months, were chosen based on a number of factors including population density, crime rates and deprivation. An independent Chairperson has been appointed to chair each Partnership pilot and I am deeply grateful to them for their public service.</p>  <p>  As the pilots progress, they will be carefully evaluated and any necessary changes made to ensure the Partnerships work as effectively as possible for the communities involved. The pilots will inform the further development of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which will facilitate the rollout of Local Community Safety Partnerships in every local authority area.</p>  <p>  The role of the LCSPs seeks to build on the good work done by Joint Policing Committees, but through an evolution and expansion of that structure. The LCSP will bring a broader focus to community safety issues, of which policing is but one factor, to enable communities to be safe and feel safe. </p>  <p>  The three pilot LCSPs which are in place are funded by my Department through the Dormant Accounts Fund. In addition, in recognition of the scale and complexity of the work of the North Inner City Dublin Partnership, additional funding was made available from the North East Inner City (NEIC) initiative and from my Department.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Budget 2022 provides for the establishment of the new Community Safety Innovation Fund. It is intended that this fund will support investment in innovative projects which will improve community safety. The fund, which is expected to grow in the coming years, will have an initial outlay in 2022 of &euro;2m.</p>  <p>  A call for funding proposals will issue shortly seeking applications for community safety projects and similar initiatives from bodies involved in community safety, including the Local Community Safety Partnerships. Applications will be assessed against stated criteria outlined in the call for proposals to ensure funding is allocated to encourage the development of innovative ways in which to improve community safety from those people who understand local community safety needs best. These criteria for allocating funding are now finalised with the fund due to be launched imminently.</p>  <p>  The Local Community Safety Partnership pilots can also apply to any other funding streams identified as appropriate by them as they progress to implementation of their community safety plans. </p>  <p>  Funding of the Local Community Safety Partnership model as it is rolled out on a national basis will be considered in line with the evaluation findings of the current Partnership pilots.</p></reply>

This has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. Work is progressing on the drafting of the Bill, with a view to its publication as soon as possible this year. </p>  <p>  The Family Court Bill will provide for the establishment of the Family Court as divisions within the existing court structures, i.e., a Family High Court, a Circuit Family Court, and a District Family Court, with each court division dealing with family law matters appropriate to its jurisdiction. As part of the General Scheme of the Family Court Bill, specialist knowledge and ongoing professional training in the area of family law would be required to be appointed as a Family Court judge. </p>  <p>   The Bill will be an important element of the Family Justice Strategy which is currently being developed by the Family Justice Oversight Group following consultation with the public, stakeholders and with children in particular.  I aim to publish the Family Justice Strategy soon. The measures proposed in the Family Court Bill will, as part of the Strategy, allow for the development of a more efficient, user-friendly, child-focused family court system that puts families at the centre of its activities, provides access to specialist supports and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings in cases where this is appropriate. </p></reply>

A concerted effort has been made over the past two years to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital enforcement of public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and countering criminal activity, and the enforcement of legislation pertaining to illegal drugs. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners. Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other state agencies to tackle the problems of drug addiction and abuse.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025". This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. The implementation of the strategy is led by my colleague, the Minister for Health, however, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs - and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued unabated throughout the pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that on 2 July 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs.</p>  <p>  Recent successes of Operation Tara include:</p>  <p>  1. Garda&iacute; attached to the Divisional Drugs Unit in Drogheda conducted a search in the Legavoureen area of Drogheda and seized more than &euro;247,000 worth of Diazepam tablets on Wednesday, 24 November 2021;</p>  <p>  2. From 30th November to 3 December 2021, Garda&iacute; in Wicklow, led by the Wicklow Divisional Drugs Unit, searched 26 locations in the county following an extensive investigation targeting the sale and supply of controlled drugs. 19 persons were charged and 12 youths were referred to the Garda Youth Diversion Programme.</p>  <p>  3. GNDOCB, assisted by other specialised units, undertook a particular operation designed to address drug-related issues being experienced in West Dublin and wider afield, including drug-related threat-to-life incidents and other forms of intimidation. On Wednesday 19 January 2022, 24 premises were searched, with &euro;700,000 in cash seized alongside 16 high value watches and eight vehicles. Six suspects were arrested in the course of the operation. </p>  <p>  4. On Saturday 29 January 2022, Garda&iacute; searched three properties in Tallaght, Dublin 24. During the course of the searches four firearms were seized, along with silencers and ammunition. Garda&iacute; also seized approximately &euro;70,000 worth of suspected heroin as well as small quantities of crack cocaine and cannabis. Two men were arrested at the scene.</p>  <p>  I can also inform the Deputy that Operation F&oacute;gra was established in the DMR on 27 November 2020, to enhance understanding and support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s response to incidents of Drug Related Intimidation (DRI) in the DMR. The objective of the operation is to have a focused, targeted approach in identifying incidents of highlighted areas of commonality within the DMR.</p>  <p>  The operation has two underpinning pillars; a harm reduction victim centred approach and information enabled policing to inform operational responses.</p>  <p>  The objectives of Operation F&oacute;gra are to increase frontline awareness of DRI, enhance collaboration with community supports, improve effectiveness of the DRI Reporting Programme and provide a greater analytical understanding of DRI to facilitate appropriate proactive interventions.</p></reply>

This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe.

The Guidelines rightly state that no one should have to suffer domestic violence and recognise that migrants may have additional vulnerability in this area, as the perpetrator may threaten a victim with the loss of their status if they report the abuse.  </p>  <p>  Anyone who is the victim of domestic abuse and whose permission to be in the State is linked to their partner, will have the issue of their status dealt with sensitively by the immigration authorities and each case will be assessed on an individual basis.</p>  <p>  I would urge anyone in this situation to approach my Department for advice and assistance and I can assure any victim of abuse that they will be supported and protected.  </p>  <p>  In line with the Immigration Guidelines, an application may be made from inside the State by a person whose immigration status as the dependent of an Irish or foreign national is valid. If the permission is not currently valid, the person may still make an application.  </p>  <p>  One of the standard conditions of an immigration permission granted in the State, is that the holder must be of good character.  Engaging in domestic violence would not be in line with this condition and could lead to the revocation or non-renewal of the perpetrator&rsquo;s own immigration status.</p>  <p>  If it is the case that the victim is in the State undocumented, it may also be open to them to make an application to the recently launched Regularisation of Long Term Undocumented Migrants Scheme. Further information is available on my Department's website at: www.irishimmigration.ie/undocumented. </p>  <p>  I would also encourage anyone who has been a victim of domestic abuse to reach out for help as soon as it is safe to do so. They can contact the Women&rsquo;s Aid Freephone Helpline on 1800 341 900. Their Telephone Interpretation Service facility covers 170 languages for callers needing support in their own language. Interpreters are available on the Language Line from 8am&ndash;8pm, 7 days a week. They can provide information on support services throughout Ireland. Further information on that service can be found at: www.womensaid.ie/services/helpline/telephoneinterp.html. </p>  <p>  This year, my Department, with the support of the Dormant Accounts fund, will be rolling out awareness raising measures to reach people within marginalised communities in Ireland to inform them of the rights they have under the Victims of Crime Act 2017 and of the Victims Charter. In order to achieve this, My Department will work with various community organisations to adapt various assets and resources for victims of crime in culturally specific ways. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I am leading on the development of a new whole-of-Government strategy to combat domestic, sexual, gender-based violence. The goal of the strategy is zero tolerance for violence against women and it recognises the added vulnerability of certain groups of women, including migrant women. </p>  <p>  A public consultation on the final draft of the Strategy commenced today and I would encourage people to engage with this consultation so that we can make sure the Strategy is correctly focused on addressing the areas that people feel need the most urgent attention. The survey can be accessed on my Department's website at: www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/DSGBV-Public-Consultation. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-17a.322.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022021700066#WRF02200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 141 together.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government is very conscious of the dangers presented by knife crime and is determined to ensure that similar problems to those which have developed in neighbouring jurisdictions do not develop here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), which includes all operational policing decisions and direction of priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Neither Minister McEntee nor I have a role in these independent functions. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I have established an Expert Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour. This forum is considering the effectiveness of existing legislation and looking at proposals for new ways forward, including whether new powers for Garda&iacute; and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders are needed. Members of the Forum, which I chair, include An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, government departments, community groups, business community members and NGOs.</p>  <p>  The Forum is examining a broad range of issues with a focus on developing measures which will counteract the negative impact of antisocial behaviour on community morale and quality of life. This has included two subgroups established to consider the specific issues of knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes. Other subgroups may be established to tackle additional specific issues as required.</p>  <p>  The knife crime subgroup is assessing available evidence to inform both legislation and community safety policies, programmes and practices with regard to knife crime. The work of this subgroup is ongoing and is expected to conclude in Q1 2022.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is a comprehensive and robust legal framework in place in Ireland with respect to knife crime, including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned. Indeed, the maximum penalty in the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority was increased from one to five years in an amendment introduced via the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</p>  <p>  Legislative responses alone will not provide a ready solution and evidence from other jurisdictions indicate that simply adopting harsher penalties will not lead to a reduction in the incidence of these crimes. Our existing five-year sentence for knife possession is longer than in the UK, for example, where a four-year penalty applies. It is important to note that there are no quick-fix solutions, based on international experience, and longer term, evidence-based strategies are needed.</p>  <p>  We will continue to examine all possible options as part of the work of the sub-group, including those undertaken in other jurisdictions, and do our utmost to ensure that our communities are, and feel, safe.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na run a number of proactive policing initiatives aimed at reducing assaults and improving feelings of community safety, including Operation Soteria (the national assault reduction strategy) and Operation Citizen in Dublin City Centre, which sees increased Garda visibility at peak times and focus on areas where antisocial behaviour and violent crime incidents have arisen recently in the capital. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's 'Use Your Brain, Not Your Fists' campaign also highlights the impacts on both victim and perpetrator of an assault.</p>  <p>  I would therefore appeal to anyone who believes that carrying or using any form of weapon, be it a knife, or even a fist, to stop and think of the lasting damage and consequences of those decisions. Even if you believe that you are protecting yourself, the lasting impact of an assault is felt long after the blow is struck. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-17a.328.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022021700066#WRF02800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130, 140, 145 and 159 together.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies are aware, the decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the presiding judge, who is independent in the exercise of his or her judicial functions. </p>  <p>  There is a constitutional presumption in favour of granting of bail, reflecting the core principle of our law is that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>  <p>  However, bail may be refused under law, for example to ensure that a person stands trial, or to prevent interference with witnesses. As the Deputies know, a referendum took place in 1996 on a proposed amendment to the Constitution. This amendment allows the courts to refuse bail for a person charged with a serious offence where that refusal is necessary to prevent the person from committing a serious offence. This referendum was passed by the People and section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 permits such refusals accordingly.</p>  <p>  Subsequent to this, the law on bail has been further strengthened on three occasions, specifically in the Criminal Justice Act 2007, the Criminal Justice Act 2015 and the Criminal Justice Act 2017.  </p>  <p>  The 2017 Act strengthened the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail. Under the Act, the Court is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the granting of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more. It is also open to judges to refuse bail for a serious offence where that is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence.</p>  <p>  Where an accused person is granted bail, the 2017 Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, including the use of curfews and strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail. If an individual fails to comply with any of the bail conditions, the judge will issue a bench warrant. This gives An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na power to arrest and bring the person before the court to answer all charges relating to the bail. </p>  <p>  In the event of a breach of High Court bail, an application is made to the High Court for a warrant and once arrested the defendant must be brought before the High Court as soon as practicable for a revocation hearing. A breach of bail may also result in an additional charge. The judge may also make an order and/or surety for &lsquo;forfeiture and estreatment&rsquo; of the bail money.</p>  <p>  Separately, I am working to strengthen the legislation in place to combat violence against women and before Easter, I will publish a Bill which will include new criminal offences for stalking and for non-fatal strangulation. While the act of stalking itself is already covered by existing law, I will propose changes to make the law clearer and stronger:</p>  <p>  - Explicitly reference stalking as a criminal offence</p>  <p>  - Make it clear that stalking includes watching or following a victim, even where they are not aware of being watched or followed.</p>  <p>  - Make it clear that impersonating the victim, and then communicating with a third party, is illegal</p>  <p>  - Update the law to ensure that it covers all forms of modern communications</p>  <p>  Furthermore, while non-fatal strangulation is already an offence prosecutable under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, I believe that creating a new offence should encourage victims to come forward and report what has happened to them. It has been shown that this crime can be an indication of future, lethal violence and is a risk factor for homicides against women in the home.</p>  <p>  In the summer, I will publish a new Hate Crime Bill which will introduce new, specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender. This will mean that certain types of crimes can be prosecuted as hate crimes where they are motivated by misogyny.</p>  <p>  For other crimes, where there isn&rsquo;t a dedicated hate-aggravated offence, the new legislation will require the court to take misogyny into account where there is evidence that this was the motivation, to reflect that fact in the sentence, and to reflect the fact that the crime was aggravated by this form of prejudice in the formal record.</p>  <p>  Before the end of September, I will publish a new Sexual Offences Bill, which will introduce important changes including:</p>  <p>  - Extending victim anonymity to further categories of victims</p>  <p>  - Repealing provisions for sentences to be delivered in public</p>  <p>  - Legal representation for victims</p>  <p>  I will also seek to enact the Sex Offenders Bill within months which will strengthen the management of sex offenders in the community.</p>  <p>  Finally, I will shortly sign an order to bring into operation the Criminal Procedure Act 2021. This Act provides for the use of preliminary trial hearings which will significantly improve the trial process for victims of sexual offences, including by reducing delay and disruption that might re-traumatise victims.</p></reply>

Rather, it will be best achieved as a whole-of-government responsibility, with Departments and agencies responsible for health and social services, education authorities and local authorities, the Garda&iacute; and the wider community working together.</p>  <p>  The new Bill will achieve this by establishing innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs) to develop local safety plans, tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves. The LCSPs will replace and build upon the existing Joint Policing Committees and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns.</p>  <p>  Each Partnership will devise and oversee a Local Community Safety Plan, which will be informed by the community itself. Membership of the Partnerships will be broader than that of the existing JPCs and will include residents, community representatives (including youth, new communities and voluntary sector representation), business and education sector representation, relevant public services including the HSE, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and local authorities as well as local councillors.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in November 2020, I announced the establishment of three Local Community Safety Partnerships on a pilot basis in the north inner city of Dublin, Waterford and Longford. The locations of the pilots, which will run for 24 months, were chosen based on a number of factors including population density, crime rates and deprivation. An independent Chairperson has been appointed to chair each Partnership pilot and I am deeply grateful to them for their public service.</p>  <p>  As the pilots progress, they will be carefully evaluated and any necessary changes made to ensure the Partnerships work as effectively as possible for the communities involved. The pilots will inform the further development of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which will facilitate the rollout of Local Community Safety Partnerships in every local authority area.</p>  <p>  The role of the LCSPs seeks to build on the good work done by Joint Policing Committee, but through an evolution and expansion of that structure. The LCSP will bring a broader focus to community safety issues, of which policing is but one factor, to enable communities to be safe and feel safe. </p>  <p>  The three LCSP pilots are each embedding in their local community structures, convening monthly partnership meetings and progressing work on their community safety plans, which are being informed by the community itself in collaboration with all partnership stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Each pilot area, in line with the commitments given by me at the outset, is already participating in a robust evaluation process which will last for the 24 month duration of the pilot.</p>  <p>  The overall aim of the evaluation is to provide actionable evidence to help inform the development of the LCSPs and their rollout across the country on completion of the pilot period, when the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill is enacted.</p>  <p>  The evaluation is exploring implementation approaches and processes that appear to be effective across and within the pilot communities. It will, over time, assess how well the Local Community Safety Partnership pilots identified the priorities and concerns of their communities; how the LCSPs conducted their work; the engagement and relationships the LCSPs had with the local communities; and the impact of the LCSP work on community safety.</p>  <p>  The evaluation of the LCSP pilots uses a mixed-methods approach, combining individual, semi-structured interviews; focus groups; observation methods; and surveys. Data is being collected across three time-points &ndash; at the beginning of the pilots, after 12 months implementation and at the end of the pilot phase.</p>  <p>  Findings from the evaluation process will inform future rollout of the LCSP model and future national community safety policy.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters. </p>  <p>  However, the Government has supported An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing the threat from organised crime gangs through the introduction of legislative measures such as:</p>  <p>  - The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016, which provides additional Garda powers for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of; and</p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, introduced to protect the justice system from being subverted by criminal groups, including potential intimidation of juries.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na strengthened its capacity to tackle organised crime in 2015, through the creation of the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB), which is headed by a Detective Chief Superintendent reporting to Assistant Commissioner, Organised &amp;amp; Serious Crime. The role is to proactively, via intelligence led investigations, target top tier Organised Crime Groups (OCGs) impacting on this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  The role of the GNDOCB is achieved through effective collaboration with all sections of Organised &amp;amp; Serious Crime, and other sections within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through partnerships with other law enforcement agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Naval Service, and partnerships developed with international law enforcement agencies globally.</p>  <p>  Since it was established, GNDOCB has had significant successes in tackling organised crime. GNDOCB have been responsible for the seizure of large quantities of controlled substances, cash, firearms, and ammunition. It has also been responsible for bringing numerous suspected offenders before the courts for offences relative to organised crime (directing and participating in activities of a criminal organisation), drug trafficking, firearms, and money laundering.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that in March 2020, Operation Tara was established with the objective of tackling drug dealing at local and street level which resulted in the establishment of the DMR West Divisional Drugs Units based out of Ballyfermot, Ronanstown, Blanchardstown, Finglas, and Cabra Garda Stations.</p>  <p>  In addition, Operation Thoroughfare was initiated in February 2021, in response to the ongoing drug dealing along the canal banks in Clondalkin. Over the course of three months, Garda&iacute; seized over &euro;98,000 of controlled drugs directly relating to drug dealing along these canal banks. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the level of drug dealing in the area has reduced as a result.</p>  <p>  In October, 2021, Operation Thoroughfare was expanded to effectively tackle the increased drug dealing taking place in and around Corkagh Park. In the first month, over &euro;29,555 of controlled drugs directly related to drug dealing around Corkagh Park was seized by Garda&iacute; with investigations ongoing into those responsible, for possessing said illegal narcotics. Operation Thoroughfare is ongoing and remains committed to effectively tackling drug dealing in the Clondalkin area.</p>  <p>  I understand that the goals of the local policing plan reflects proactive policing around illegal drug dealing. The DMR West Divisional Drugs Unit on a regular basis collaborate with local uniform and detective units. Furthermore, the DMR West Divisional Drugs Unit work closely with regional and national specialist units in targeting individuals and Organised Crime Gangs involved in the illegal sale and supply of narcotics in the Clondalkin and wider DMR West area.</p>  <p>  I am informed that a recent operation in January 2022, involved the DMR West Divisional Drugs Unit from all four Garda Stations in the DMR West Division targeting an international Organised Crime Gang based in the Clondalkin area. This operation resulted in the seizure of over &euro;500,000 cash and a number of assets. Garda investigations are ongoing into this significant seizure.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Local Drugs &amp;amp; Alcohol Task Force researches, develops and implements locally orientated and co-ordinated responses to substance misuse in the Clondalkin area. Garda&iacute; form part of this multi-agency approach and regularly utilise the other institutions of the state such as customs, social welfare, housing, and probation services in an effort to tackle local drug dealing issues.</p>  <p>  Operation F&oacute;gra is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s response in the DMR to Drug Related Intimidation (DRI) and continues to be embedded in the Region. The operation has two underpinning pillars: a harm reduction victim centred approach and an information enabled policing informing operational responses. The objectives of Operation F&oacute;gra have increased frontline awareness of DRI and enhanced collaboration among operational members.</p>  <p>  The relentless efforts of Garda&iacute; in the DMR West Division will continue to proactively identify individuals and gangs involved in illegal narcotics in the Clondalkin area. Garda&iacute; will continue to effectively tackle these individuals and gangs through co-ordinated operations, initiatives, and days of actions. Garda&iacute; will utilise every opportunity to disrupt the activities of these individuals and gangs, together with seizing their assets and illegal gains while holding them accountable before the courts for their actions</p></reply>

If the declaration of parentage is granted, the father may apply for guardianship under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.</p>  <p>  An intending mother of a child born through surrogacy, not being the birth mother of the child, cannot be granted a declaration of parentage under the Status of Children Act 1987.  An intending father who is not the genetic father of the child also cannot be granted a declaration of parentage. </p>  <p>  Under section 6C of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, a person can apply to be appointed as a child&rsquo;s guardian if he or she is married to, or in a civil partnership with, the child&rsquo;s parent or has cohabited with the child&rsquo;s parent for over three years and if the person has shared responsibility for the child&rsquo;s day-to-day care for more than two years.</p></reply>

The guidelines will deal with admissibility of judicial complaints, informal resolution of complaints and codes for conduct and ethics.</p>  <p>  At its meeting on 4 February 2022, the Judicial Council adopted Guidelines for the Judiciary on Conduct and Ethics.  These Guidelines form part of a suite of measures which aim to support the core judicial values of independence, impartiality, integrity, equality, propriety, competence and diligence. </p>  <p>  They underpin the high standards and principles which judges in Ireland apply to manage the ethical and conduct issues which they encounter and to help the public understand the role of the judiciary and their professional standards. Further information on the Judicial Council and its Committees is available on the Council&rsquo;s website at www.judicialcouncil.ie</p>  <p>  I will shortly make orders to bring into operation those relevant provisions of the Judicial Council Act 2019 which have not yet been commenced.</p>  <p>  Any instances of harassment or abusive behaviour should, of course, be reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their appropriate investigation. </p></reply>

The new Regulations contain technical amendments to reflect changes in legislation, and also to revise the language requirement for applicants.</p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) requires that I, as Minister for Justice, consult with the Garda Commissioner and Policing Authority prior to requesting Government approval to bring Regulations concerning the operational matters of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into effect. The Regulations were finalised following extensive engagement between my Department, the Public Appointments Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and in consultation with the Policing Authority and the Garda Associations.</p>  <p>  For the 2022 and subsequent recruitment competitions, applicants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must, as previously, be proficient in English or Irish. However, the requirement to be proficient in a second language has been removed.</p>  <p>  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland noted that diversity is a vital asset to any organisation that seeks to be innovative and adaptable.</p>  <p>  I am informed that a team within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carried out extensive research into barriers to recruitment and inclusivity, as well as international research regarding benchmarking against other police services. I am further informed this that research identified a number of potential barriers to recruitment, such as educational attainment, language proficiency and nationality. I understand An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged directly with diverse communities also, and again the previous requirement for two languages was raised as a difficulty. </p>  <p>  The requirement for proficiency in only one language, which must be either English or Irish, will remove any potential disadvantage for people who have not had the opportunity to achieve proficiency in two languages, but who still wish to serve as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to the Irish language and studies in the Irish language will remain part of the Policing BA delivered to all trainee Garda&iacute; in the Garda College, Templemore. A new Irish Language Strategy has been developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will be launched early in 2022. The Strategy aims to strengthen Irish language services within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ensure compliance with statutory language obligations.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that Budget 2022 includes significant additional funding to support initiatives under the Youth Justice Strategy and the new Community Safety Innovation Fund which will support community based initiatives to ensure public safety. In addition, North Inner City Dublin is one of three pilot locations where Local Community Safety Partnerships have been established.</p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; continue to implement high visibility policing plans to address public disorder related issues and anti-social behaviour, with particular overt and targeted policing of public places at times when public order incidents and anti-social behaviour typically increase, such as bank holiday weekends. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Citizen commenced in Dublin city centre on 22 October 2021. This operation places a particular focus on anti-social behaviour, public order and quality of life issues, assaults and high-volume crimes, and involves increased visible policing, particularly at key locations. In addition to Garda resources from the Dublin Metropolitan Region North Central and South Central divisions, Operation Citizen is supported by resources from the wider Dublin Region, Garda Roads Policing Units, the Garda National Public Order Unit and Garda Operational Support Units (Mounted Unit and Dog Unit).</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that there are in excess of 100 Garda&iacute; patrolling Dublin city centre each weekend evening. Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening from 4pm, up to 30 additional Garda&iacute; are deployed specifically on foot patrols in the city centre, resourced from outside the two core city centre divisions. Every Friday and Saturday evening, a Garda National Public Order Unit of 25 personnel (on mobile patrols) patrols the city centre. In excess of 500 additional hours of policing are provided each week. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have recently confirmed that the Operation will continue into 2022. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that Garda Operation Soteria is also in place to ensure a reduction of assaults in public, reduce fear of violence within communities, prioritise assault investigations and focus on problem areas and assault hotspots. </p></reply>

I am very conscious of the repercussions that such behaviour can have on the quality of life for residents in local communities. It is important that people feel safe and are safe in their communities.</p>  <p>  There are a number of policy approaches ongoing, including the Local Community Safety Partnerships, the Youth Justice Strategy, the Greentown pilot programme, the Drogheda Implementation Plan and the socio-economic and community plan for Darndale and the surrounding areas in Dublin 17.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department published the general scheme of the landmark Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill last year. The Bill will provide for a key principle from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, namely that preventing crime and harm and making our communities safer does not rest with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department alone. Rather, it will be best achieved as a whole-of-government responsibility, with Departments and agencies responsible for health and social services, education authorities and local authorities, the Garda&iacute; and the wider community working together.</p>  <p>  The new Bill will achieve this by establishing innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs) to develop local safety plans, tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves. The LCSPs will replace and build upon the existing Joint Policing Committees and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns.</p>  <p>  Each Partnership will devise and oversee a Local Community Safety Plan, which will be informed by the community itself. Membership of the Partnerships will be broader than that of the existing JPCs and will include residents, community representatives (including youth, new communities and voluntary sector representation), business and education sector representation, relevant public services including the HSE, Tusla, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and local authorities as well as local councillors.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in November 2020, I announced the establishment of three Local Community Safety Partnerships on a pilot basis in the north inner city of Dublin, Waterford and Longford. The locations of the pilots, which will run for 24 months, were chosen based on a number of factors including population density, crime rates and deprivation. An independent Chairperson has been appointed to chair each Partnership pilot. </p>  <p>  Each pilot area, in line with the commitments given at the outset, is participating in a robust evaluation process which will last for the 24 month duration of the pilot. The overall aim of the evaluation is to provide actionable evidence to help inform the development of the LCSPs and their rollout across the country on completion of the pilot period, after the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill is enacted. The evaluation is exploring implementation approaches and processes that appear to be effective across and within the pilot communities. It will, over time, assess how well the Local Community Safety Partnership pilots identified the priorities and concerns of their communities; how the LCSPs conducted their work; the engagement and relationships the LCSPs had with the local communities; and the impact of the LCSP work on community safety. Findings from the evaluation process will inform future rollout of the LCSP model in every local authority area.</p>  <p>  The role of the LCSPs seeks to build on the good work done by Joint Policing Committee, but through an evolution and expansion of that structure. The LCSP will bring a broader focus to community safety issues, of which policing is but one factor, to enable communities to be safe and feel safe.</p>  <p>  In addition, as the Deputy may be aware, Budget 2022 provides for the establishment of the new Community Safety Innovation Fund. It is intended that this fund will support investment in innovative projects which will improve community safety. The fund, which is expected to grow in the coming years, will have an initial outlay in 2022 of &euro;2m. A call for funding proposals will issue shortly seeking applications for community safety projects and similar initiatives from bodies involved in community safety, including the Local Community Safety Partnerships.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department published the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-27 last year. The Strategy provides a national developmental framework to pursue more effective engagement, collaboration and community support related to youth offending and the factors underlying it. Important priorities include the development of Youth Diversion Projects (YDPs), which are directly funded by my Department, to include targeted work with &lsquo;harder-to-reach&rsquo; young people. This includes young people heavily involved in crime and anti-social behaviour, for whom there is a lack of appropriate supports and interventions in practice, unless they are before the courts, in which case they may be under the supervision of the Probation Service. The Strategy also prioritises early intervention work, including with younger children who are assessed as being at serious risk. Both these cohorts may include children at risk of recruitment by crime gangs.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy began with the establishment of a cross-agency Governance and Strategy Group, and a Youth Justice Oversight Group. Both groups are chaired by my Department, which will provide oversight arrangements for Youth Justice Initiatives, including the Greentown pilots, to support a more cohesive response in practice to the needs of particular cohorts of children and particular communities. The implementation of the Youth Justice Strategy is also supported by a Youth Justice Advisory Group, chaired by Minister Browne, which reflects the opinions and experience of a wide range of community and expert stakeholders to assist in the ongoing development of youth justice policies and programmes. </p>  <p>  The Greentown pilot programme represents an import deliverable under the Youth Justice Strategy. This internationally recognised initiative is being led by the REPPP Project, (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice), at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL).  The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership between UL and my Department. The REPPP originally produced the &ldquo;Greentown Report&rdquo;, which studied the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland, and was published in December 2016.</p>  <p>  The Greentown Report identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children. It outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations.</p>  <p>  The Greentown Report recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. The REPPP project team implemented a bespoke design process to produce a model for an Irish evidence-informed intervention programme. This new Greentown Programme has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development.</p>  <p>  Pilot applications of the Greentown Programme, developed by the REPPP, commenced in two locations in 2020 and will run for three years. The learning from these pilots will then be incorporated into mainstream YDP practice. This specially designed intervention programme was developed with international expert advice, to tackle coercive control of children by criminal groups which entraps them in offending situations. Funds are already available for the initial pilots from the Dormant Accounts Funds, with a total of &euro;4.2m allocated over three years.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Drogheda Implementation Plan, the Deputy will be aware the publication and implementation of the recommendations of the Drogheda scoping report were key actions in my Department's Justice Plan 2021.</p>  <p>  I am grateful to the former Director of the Probation Service, Mr. Vivian Geiran, who made over 70 recommendations in his scoping report on short and long term responses to challenges the community faces in Drogheda. This includes measures around crime prevention, youth services, drug addiction, education, infrastructure and community development. The recommendations highlight the need for improved interagency cooperation in the administration and delivery of State services in Drogheda, as well as the need to resource public services or provide additional services in certain areas in particular.</p>  <p>  In July 2021, I obtained Government approval for an Implementation Plan for Drogheda. I also secured commitment from across Government that, given the manifest needs, there will be a special focus on Drogheda including, where necessary, Departments and State agencies prioritising funding applications for projects in Drogheda related to the Drogheda Implementation Plan.</p>  <p>  The Implementation Plan identifies the relevant stakeholders for each recommendation and outlines the next steps for engagement and delivery. I intend that the Plan will be a living document and thus reviewed by my Department each quarter, with progress reports produced twice yearly. This will allow for ongoing engagement and consultation.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the recent report which has set out a socio-economic and community plan for Darndale and the surrounding areas in Dublin 17. Under Justice Plan 2021, my Department committed to supporting and working with Dublin City Council (DCC) to ensure the implementation of the report on Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, DCC commissioned this report in response to the escalating levels of violence in these areas of north Dublin in 2019 and 2020. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the area&rsquo;s assets, services, and significant levels of State supports as well as its inherent challenges.</p>  <p>  The Darndale Implementation Oversight Group (DIOG) was established in February 2021 and is meeting on a monthly basis, chaired by former Assistant Garda Commissioner Jack Nolan. The importance which is being placed on the implementation of the report by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is demonstrated by the presence of the local Chief Superintendent, Superintendent and Inspector, all of whom sit on the group.</p>  <p>  While many of the report's recommendations relate to issues such as youth services, drugs services, the physical environment and community services and facilities, I am informed that implementation of the Garda actions is well underway, including the Community Hub proposal.</p>  <p>  As well as important recommendations related to crime prevention and dismantling gangs, two key recommendations include the need to strengthen community participation and leadership, and the need for more collaboration in relation to delivery of state services. This closely aligns to work by my Department to develop a new community safety policy in line with the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p></reply>

I know I speak for everyone in this House in utterly condemning these senseless and cowardly attacks and also in my belief that the perpetrators must be brought to justice. </p>  <p>  Incidents like these, although rare, are terrifying not only for the victim themselves but for the entire community.  Home is the one place we should all be able to feel safe, and fear in one&rsquo;s own home is something that can never be tolerated.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to ensuring that there is strong, visible community policing right across both rural and urban Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and detecting crime. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  This year&rsquo;s winter phase of Operation Thor was launched by Garda&iacute; in October 2021 and is designed to tackle burglaries and associated criminal activities, which often increase in the darker winter months, through targeted enforcement and crime prevention activity and information.</p>  <p>  This annual focus from Operation Thor has proved highly successful in tackling property related crime since its inception in November 2015.  In 2015, there were in excess of 18,800 residential burglaries reported. By contrast, to the end of 2021 there were just over 6,000 residential burglaries reported, a reduction of over 66% or approximately 13,000 less residential burglaries.</p>  <p>  While the COVID-19 pandemic was clearly a factor in some of this reduction, with people more likely to be present in their homes throughout the day, there has been a marked and consistent downward trend in such offences since the introduction of this Garda focus through Operation Thor.</p>  <p>  The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation in excess of &euro;2 billion for 2022, including funding for the recruitment of up to 800 additional Garda trainees and up to 400 Garda staff. This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe. To this end, the Deputy will be aware that a new Garda recruitment competition opened last week and I would encourage anyone with an interest in a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply.</p>  <p>  In addition to new recruits, the rollout of the new Garda Operating Model will support the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from non-core duties to frontline policing across the country. The new model will see larger Divisions with more resources, increased Garda visibility in communities, a wider range of locally delivered policing services, and a strong focus on community policing.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also allocated &euro;12m for investment in the Garda fleet, which means more high visibility policing in our towns and cities. This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  </p>  <p>  My Department has for many years provided funding for the employment and associated costs of the national Community Alert Programme, including the employment of regional Development Officers. In 2021, my Department committed in the region of &euro;150,000 to local communities who wish to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running their local Text Alert Scheme, which is administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re. This is a continuation of the annual funding made available by the Department for the Text Alert Rebate scheme each year since 2016.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, while community policing is a central feature of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that is reinforced in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, that report also highlighted that policing and crime prevention are not the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department alone.</p>  <p>  To achieve better outcomes, supported by a strong inter-agency collaboration and community engagement, three pilot Local Community Safety Partnerships have been established. These Partnerships will provide a dedicated communication channel for input and the development of Local Community Safety Plans to reflect and respond to the self-identified needs of that community.</p>  <p>  In addition, I will launch the Community Safety Innovation Fund in the coming weeks, which will enable local communities to seek funding for innovative projects which will improve community safety in their areas.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Rural and Community Development funds the Senior Alert Scheme, which provides grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms for persons aged 65 or older and of limited means. The objective of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to encourage community support for vulnerable older people in our communities through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable them to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind.

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters. </p>  <p>  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use. I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to them, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has provided an unprecedented allocation of in excess of &euro;2 billion to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which includes funding for the recruitment of up to 800 additional Garda trainees and 400 Garda staff. This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe, and to preventing crime in all its forms.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the new Operating Model for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was designed to streamline Garda administration and to provide a more visible, responsive and localised policing service to communities nationwide.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that Castlebar Garda Station continues as the location for the Divisional Headquarters of Mayo and will continue to be the Divisional Headquarters when Mayo concludes its ongoing amalgamation with the Roscommon and Longford Division as part of the rollout of the new Garda Operating Model.</p>  <p>  Castlebar Station is the location for the Business Service Functional Area which provides Business Support for Mayo, Roscommon and Longford.</p>  <p>  In terms of Garda resources in Mayo Division, I can confirm that at 31 January 2022, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 331 Garda members to Mayo Division, of which 76 were assigned to Castlebar District and 71 members were assigned to Castlebar Garda station. I am further advised that there were 33 Garda staff members assigned to Castlebar Garda station at 31 January 2022, the latest date for which figures are available. This is an increase of 230% since December 2010 when there were 10 Garda staff assigned to the station. </p>  <p>  This significant increase in Garda staff includes 24 additional staff members who are attached to the Business Services Area. This is alongside the Community Engagement Area, Property Management Area, Roads Policing, Crime Units, CPD School and Courts Office.</p>  <p>  Detailed information on the Garda workforce is available on my Department's website at:</p>  <p>  www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/Garda_Workforce</p>  <p>  For more general information on Garda facts and figures, the Deputy may also wish to see the information on the link below:</p>  <p>  www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/An_Garda_Siochana_facts_and_figures</p></reply>

Applications will be accepted for six months until 31 July, when the scheme will close.  The scheme includes a parallel strand, which opened for applications on 7 February 2022, to implement the recommendation included in the report of the Expert Advisory Group, allowing international protection applicants who have an outstanding application for international protection and have been in the asylum process for a minimum of two years to apply.  </p>  <p>  This once-in-a-generation scheme is designed to give long-term undocumented people without a current permission to remain in the State, the chance to regularise their status, access the labour market and begin their path to citizenship.  As the Deputy will be aware, it has been widely welcomed by those who have long campaigned for this right. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that almost 2,200 applications have been received up to 16 February. This is a very positive start and I encourage anyone who may be eligible to apply. </p>  <p>  I am aware, particularly in the current economic climate, of the financial pressures that people are under. However, the fees payable by an applicant are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing applications for the scheme which, given the benefits involved, is quite a detailed process. </p>  <p>  A fee of &euro;700 will generally apply to family unit applications and children up to 23 years, living with their parent(s), can be included in a family unit application. A fee of &euro;550 will apply to individual applications. There is no provision for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees. </p>  <p>  Successful applicants to the scheme will be required to register the permission granted and everyone over the age of 18 years will be required to pay a registration fee of &euro;300 which is the standard registration fee applicable to all applicants.</p>  <p>  There is no application or registration fee for the international protection strand of the scheme. </p>  <p>  If a person is resident in the State without permission and does not meet the terms of the published schemes, I would encourage them to contact my Department or their local immigration office and to take all appropriate steps to regularise their status in the State. Any application submitted should explain their current circumstances and future intentions in the State and provide any documentation they feel will support their application. Following receipt of an application, a full consideration of all aspects of their case will be carried out before a decision is made, including a consideration of their private and family life rights, in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.  </p>  <p>  In all cases, people must engage with the authorities if they wish to be permitted to remain here legally. A pragmatic approach is taken in relation to each case, which is considered on its individual merits.</p></reply>

While applicants for international protection are generally interviewed, the legislation allows a trained international protection officer to dispense with the interview if they are of the opinion that, based on the available evidence, the applicant is a person that should be granted a refugee declaration. </p>  <p>  Other measures include the restructuring of teams within the International Protection Office (IPO) to allow for more efficient workflow, identification and streamlining of processes and ensuring that staff are directed to the areas where they can add most value. </p>  <p>  A case management function has been implemented to have oversight of applications and ensure they are moved through the process without unnecessary delay. Additional staff have also been trained to conduct interviews, which has increased interviewing capacity, and a revised, &ldquo;plain English&rdquo; approved, shorter international protection questionnaire is in place since 28 June 2021, and is available in a wide selection of languages. Applicants can also now fill in the questionnaire online and submit it by e-mail to the IPO. The online questionnaire is currently available in English, French and Arabic, with more languages to follow. </p>  <p>  The Regularisation Scheme for Long-Term Undocumented Migrants includes a parallel process to implement recommendation 6.2 of the Catherine Day Expert Advisory Group Report. International protection applicants who have an outstanding application for international protection and have been in the asylum process for a minimum of two years can now apply for consideration under this separate strand of the Regularisation Scheme. My Department has recently written to approximately 4,000 potentially eligible applicants inviting them to apply under the Scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department will, by October 2022 at the latest, commence a review of progress made in reducing and improving processing times.</p>  <p>  With regard to recommendation 3.15 of the Report of the Expert Advisory Group this is currently being considered by the Legal Aid Board in terms of resourcing and requirements, and my Department continues to engage with them. </p></reply>

The new Regulations contain technical amendments to reflect changes in legislation, and also to revise the language requirement for applicants.</p>  <p>  For the 2022 and subsequent recruitment competitions, applicants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must, as previously, be proficient in English or Irish.  However, the requirement to be proficient in a second language has been removed.</p>  <p>  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland noted that diversity is a vital asset to any organisation that seeks to be innovative and adaptable.</p>  <p>  I am informed that a team within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carried out extensive research into barriers to recruitment and inclusivity, as well as international research regarding benchmarking against other police services. I am further informed this that research identified a number of potential barriers to recruitment, such as educational attainment, language proficiency and nationality. I understand An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged directly with diverse communities also, and again the previous requirement for two languages was raised as a difficulty.</p>  <p>  The requirement for proficiency in only one language, which must be either English or Irish, will remove any potential disadvantage for people who have not had the opportunity to achieve proficiency in two languages, but who still wish to serve as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that promotions to the ranks of Sergeant and Inspector in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are governed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Appointment to the Ranks of Inspector and Sergeant) Regulations 2021.</p>  <p>  The new Regulations mark a fundamental change by providing that promotion competitions to the supervisory ranks of Sergeant and Inspector, which previously had been managed internally by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will for the first time be conducted under the remit of the Public Appointments Service (PAS).</p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) requires that I, as Minister for Justice, consult with the Garda Commissioner and Policing Authority prior to requesting Government approval to bring Regulations concerning the operational matters of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into effect. The Regulations were finalised following extensive engagement between my Department, the Public Appointments Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and in consultation with the Policing Authority and the Garda Associations.</p>  <p>  Development of the Regulations was informed by the 2015 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate report &ldquo;Changing Policing in Ireland&rdquo;, which recommended establishing new promotion and selection processes, and by the 2015 audit of the Commission for Public Service Appointments which found that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Promotion) Regulations 2006 were outdated and needed to be reviewed.</p>  <p>  The previous Regulations governing promotion to the Sergeant rank required candidates to have passed a proficiency test in the Irish language. As the Deputy will be aware, entrants to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already undergo extensive training, including training for proficiency in Irish. Following consultations between my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Policing Authority and the Public Appointments Service, it was agreed that achievement of the 50% grade in the Oral Competency Examination in Irish was not an essential requirement for candidates to be eligible for promotion to the ranks of Sergeant or Inspector. This is also in keeping with best practice for other promotional competitions across the public service.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to the Irish language and studies in the Irish language will remain part of the Policing BA delivered to all trainee Garda&iacute; in the Garda College, Templemore. A new Irish Language Strategy has been developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will be launched early in 2022. The Strategy aims to strengthen Irish language services within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ensure compliance with statutory language obligations. </p>  <p>  I am informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a Directive issued in 2018 to ensure that only members with the appropriate Irish language skills would transfer to Gaeltacht stations, with a view to increasing the number of bilingual personnel in these stations.  An Irish Language Proficiency Panel (ILPP) has also been established under the same directive, and includes members recruited through the Irish Language Stream as well as members who wish to be transferred to Gaeltacht stations, having obtained the requisite result in the Irish oral assessment.</p>  <p>  One of the Irish Language Strategy goals is to increase the number of members on the ILPP by establishing a working group to examine incentives for members to request a transfer to Gaeltacht stations.</p></reply>

The audit was carried out as part of the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  On foot of this audit, it has now been agreed that my Department will take over responsibility, through Tusla initially, for service delivery, in addition to its existing policy coordination responsibility for this important area. A detailed plan for how this will happen is being prepared. </p>  <p>  The Tusla review highlights gaps in geographical coverage and inadequate provision of safe accommodation, including refuges, to meet population needs. It recommends an approach to address this with immediate, medium and long term actions required, providing a list of priority areas where additional services would address the most immediate need.</p>  <p>  I intend to work with Tusla to ensure that the areas highlighted in the review are prioritised and, in the medium term, there will be further service expansion in other areas. It is my intention to develop an implementation plan in which the number of refuge spaces available will meet our commitments under the Istanbul Convention.</p>  <p>  The response to DSGBV is a cross departmental and multi-agency issue. As you know, I&rsquo;m leading the development across Government of the new national strategy to combat DSGBV. It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in Irish society for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p>  <p>  The third national strategy to combat domestic and sexual violence will also make provision for how we deliver refuge spaces, both in the immediate and longer term, to cater for the needs of victims.  </p>  <p>  Yesterday, I spoke once again with the NGO sector and shared a draft of the forthcoming strategy as part of our ongoing consultation with the sector. Today, I have launched a public consultation on the strategy.  Following these consultations, I intend to finalise and bring to Government the strategy and accompanying detailed action plan in April, after which it will be published and implementation will commence.</p></reply>

The COVID-19 WCS is underpinned by a counter-guarantee from the European Investment Bank Group through its InnovFin SME guarantee instrument.</p>  <p>  Three banks participated in this scheme.  Over &euro;100 million was sanctioned across more than 800 loans up to September 2020. After this the uptake of this scheme tapered off as the tailor made COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme had become available in the market. The COVID-19 WCS is now closed to new eligibility applications, however some eligibility code holders may yet proceed to loan application.  As of 14 February 2022, 987 loans progressed to sanction under the scheme, to a total value of &euro;128,196,963.  </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is the largest scheme of its type in the history of the State and provides up to &euro;2 billion in lending.  Since its launch in September 2020, it has enabled vital access to loans for the SME sector.  There have been over 9,186 loans drawn or approved to a value of &euro;640  million under the Scheme up to 31 January  2022. These loans are being drawn from all over the country by businesses which have been most impacted by the effects of COVID-19.  The wholesale and retail sector, the accommodation and food services sector, the construction sector and the primary agriculture and fisheries sector account for 58% of all loans drawn under the scheme demonstrating that funding is getting to where it is most needed.</p>  <p>  Loans of up to &euro;1 million are available for up to 5.5 years. Loans under &euro;250,000 do not require any personal guarantees or collateral.  The Scheme is currently available through three commercial banks, six non-bank lenders and nineteen credit unions thus providing competition in the market and a variety of loan products. This long-term policy goal of diversification adds competition in the market and ensures a wide range of loan products are available throughout the regions.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has been developed in accordance with the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Temporary Framework and has been extended three times since September 2020 following extensions of the Temporary Framework by the European Commission.  The last extension was in December 2021 and makes the scheme available until 30 June 2022.  Any further extension of the scheme beyond that point is dependent on an extension of the Temporary Framework.  I would therefore encourage businesses to avail of these low-cost loans in the remaining time of the scheme, which can be used for both working capital and investment purposes.</p></reply>

This scheme is in addition to the Government&rsquo;s ongoing measures to address energy poverty and the protection of vulnerable customers, and to the measures introduced in the Budget.The scheme will apply to all domestic accounts and will include pre-pay customers.</p><p>  I understand that the majority of the 300,000 tenancies registered with the RTB would hold their own domestic electricity accounts.

Operating within this overall EU framework, responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets, is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity and gas markets following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999.In line with long standing policy on deregulating price setting, CRU ended its regulation of retail prices in the electricity market in 2011, and in the gas market in 2014. Given that prices are no longer regulated, they are set by all suppliers as entirely commercial and operational matters by them. Each supplier has its own business model and approach to pricing decisions over time, in accordance with factors such as their overall company strategic direction and developments in their cost base. ESB Networks connection charges and distribution use of system charges are based on procedures and policies as approved by CRU.</p><p>  The CRU, as the Deputy will appreciate, is an independent statutory regulator and is accountable for the performance of its functions to the Oireachtas, and not to me as Minister.

In August 2019, my predecessor, Minister Ross, made a submission to the European Commissioner for Transport, Violeta Bulc, regarding the review.

We asked for new criteria that recognise ports with high offshore renewable energy potential in order to seek the inclusion of Galway Port on the network.</p><p>Regarding the rail network, my Department informed the Commission that our position on the TEN-T rail network will be informed by the results of the ongoing all-island Strategic Rail Review and that we would hope to have the outcome of the Review reflected in the maps. The Strategic Rail Review is being undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure Northern Ireland and will inform the development of the railway sector on the Island of Ireland over the coming decades.  The Review will consider the potential scope for improved rail services along the various existing, or future potential, corridors of the network.  That scope includes the Western Rail Corridor.</p><p>Regarding other transport modes on the Western Arc, major roads in the west are already included on the TEN-T Comprehensive network. Also on the Comprehensive TEN-T network are the airports of Donegal, Inis M&oacute;r, Kerry, Ireland West and Shannon. Cork airport and the Port of Cork and Shannon-Foynes port are on the Core TEN-T Network.</p><p>The Commission completed its review of the TEN-T Regulation in May 2021 and the evaluation report is available at the following link:</p><p>eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021SC0117 </p><p>In December 2021, the EU Commission published its proposal for a revised TEN-T Regulation and negotiations on the text have now begun in Brussels.

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exempt from VAT. </p>  <p>  A person who is self-building a house would expect to incur costs mainly for building materials and construction services, both of which are subject to VAT. </p>  <p>  Under the EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT legislation the, supply of the building materials is liable to VAT at the standard rate. By way of special derogation from the general rule, however, Ireland is permitted to continue its long-standing practice of applying a reduced rate, currently 13.5%, to the supply of ready-to-pour concrete and certain concrete blocks but there are strict restrictions on this derogation, including that its scope cannot be extended to other building material and that the rate cannot be reduced below 12%.  </p>  <p>  Under the EU VAT Directive the supply of construction services is liable to VAT at the standard rate generally across the EU but Ireland applies a 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to all construction services under a derogation from the EU VAT Directive, again subject to strict restrictions. </p>  <p>  There is no provision in the Directive to permit the application of an exemption from VAT on construction services or building materials provided for a self-build.</p>  <p>  As a general point of EU law, VAT is a tax on consumption and is applied to supplies being made by a person and not to supplies received by a person.  For that reason, it is not permissible to apply different VAT rates or exemptions to different customers.  Therefore, it would not be possible to accept a proposal to exempt from VAT supplies to particular categories of buyers, such as individual self-builders.</p>  <p>  In relation to self-build properties, substantial support is already available through the tax system for first-time buyers, including those self-building their first home. The Help to Buy (HTB) incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy referred to the VAT rate on self-builds in Northern Ireland. When it was within the EU, the UK, by way of special derogation from the general rule, was permitted to continue its long-standing practice of applying a zero rate of VAT to the supply of certain residential buildings and I understand it also has arrangements for a refund of VAT incurred on building materials and services when building a new home.  Since 1 January 2021, the UK is no longer part of the EU and, therefore, its VAT arrangements are no longer subject to the VAT Directive. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-17a.497.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022021700069#WRJ03100"><p>The general position is that all tax expenditures and reliefs fall to be considered as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process.     </p>  <p>  In relation to the annual age exemption limits, section 188 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) provides for these exemptions and associated marginal relief. Where the age exemption applies the claimant&rsquo;s income will be exempt from income tax in that year.</p>  <p>  The age exemption applies for any year of assessment where an individual is aged 65 years or over and his or her total income does not exceed &euro;18,000. Where an individual is a married person or civil partner and is jointly assessed to tax, the age exemption will apply where either individual is aged 65 or over and where the couple&rsquo;s total income does not exceed &euro;36,000. The relevant income thresholds may be increased further if the individual has a qualifying child. The thresholds are increased by &euro;575 in respect of both the first and second child, and &euro;830 in respect of each subsequent child.</p>  <p>  Marginal relief may be available where the individual&rsquo;s or couple&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit but is less than twice that amount. Where marginal relief applies the individual or couple is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limit to a ceiling of twice the exemption limit.  Once the income exceeds twice the exemption limit marginal relief is no longer available and the individual pays tax under the normal tax system.  It should be noted, however, that where the individual&rsquo;s income is greater than the exemption limit but below twice that limit, the taxpayer is always given the benefit of the more favourable treatment as between the use of marginal relief or the normal tax system of credits and bands.   </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Budget 2022 included a significant tax package amounting to a cost of &euro;520 million. This included a substantial income tax package comprising of an increase of &euro;50 in each of the main tax credits &ndash; personal tax credit, employee tax credit and the earned income credit &ndash; from &euro;1,650 to &euro;1,700.  An increase of &euro;1,500 in the income tax standard rate band for all income earners was also introduced. Furthermore, the 2% rate band ceiling for USC was also increased for 2022 in line with the increase in the national minimum wage to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate of &euro;10.20 to &euro;10.50 will remain outside the top rates of USC. Further details can be located at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/7e491-taxation-measures/.    </p>  <p>  Having regard to the fiscal demands and pressures facing the State in 2022, it would not have been possible to increase all tax credits and reliefs and remain within the fiscal parameters. However, it is worth pointing out that the age exemption limits are at a level which compares favourably with the tax treatment of the generality of taxpayers.   </p>  <p>  Additional guidance on a range of other tax credits and reliefs, such as the age tax credit,  that may be available for individuals over 65 years of age can be found in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-26, which can be located at the following link &ndash; Tax and Duty Manual: www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-26.pdf.</p>  <p>  In addition, it is also worth noting that the State Contributory Pension and the State Non-Contributory Pension are not chargeable to Universal Social Charge or Pay Related Social Insurance.</p>  <p>  Taking all of the above factors into consideration, I am satisfied that the age exemption limits in their current form are appropriately calibrated at present and there are no immediate plans to review or amend the limits.</p></reply>

As part of these measures, Revenue operated a COVID-19 Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) provided the payment of income supports to employers in respect of eligible employees, where the employer&rsquo;s business activities experienced significant negative disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The TWSS started from 26 March 2020 and superseded the Employer COVID Refund scheme, which Revenue operated on behalf of the Department of Social Protection. The Employer COVID Refund scheme was an emergency support to employers that had run for a very short period from 19 March 2020.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the TWSS was to get much needed financial assistance to employees, while retaining the employer/employee relationship which facilitated the early recommencement of normal business when conditions permitted.</p>  <p>  The TWSS was open to employers who self-declared to Revenue that they experienced significant negative economic disruption due to Covid-19. They had to demonstrate that they met the criteria laid out in Revenue&rsquo;s published Guidance on Employer Eligibility and Supporting Proofs</p>  <p>  The TWSS was legislated for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  The scheme was predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picked up.  The employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income for the duration of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that a &lsquo;transitional phase&rsquo; of the TWSS ran from 26 March 2020 to 3 May 2020.  During this period, the rate of subsidy was based on an employee&rsquo;s Average Revenue Net Weekly Pay (ARNWP) and, where eligible employees&rsquo; ARNWP was:</p>  <p>  - less than or equal to &euro;586 per week, a maximum subsidy of &euro;410 was payable</p>  <p>  - greater than &euro;586 and less than or equal to &euro;960 per week, a maximum subsidy of &euro;350 was payable.</p>  <p>  Revenue implemented the &lsquo;operational phase&rsquo; of TWSS from 4 May 2020. Under this phase, where an employee&rsquo;s ARNWP was:</p>  <p>  - less than, or equal to, &euro;412, he/she would have received a subsidy of 85% of their ARNWP, up to a maximum of &euro;350 per week</p>  <p>  - more than &euro;412, and up to &euro;500, he/she would have received a flat rate of &euro;350 per week</p>  <p>  - more than &euro;500, and up to &euro;586, he/she would have received 70% of their ARNWP up to a maximum of &euro;410 per week.</p>  <p>  Where an employee&rsquo;s ARNWP exceeded &euro;586 per week, the wage subsidy did not exceed &euro;350 per week.  It was calculated with reference to the additional payment an employee received from his/her employer and its effect on his/her average weekly pay.</p>  <p>  By its nature, the &lsquo;transitional phase&rsquo; of the TWSS was delivered in a very short timeframe as was necessary to get critical funding to employers as quickly as possible to ensure employees were retained in employment.  It was always acknowledged that there was potentially an element of overclaim involved with this phase.  The &lsquo;operational phase&rsquo;, on the other hand, was delivered over a longer period of time and accommodated tapering of the subsidy rates and other features that ensured a more precise subsidy amount was paid out based on the payroll data provided by employers.</p>  <p>  I am further advised that Revenue carried out a comprehensive reconciliation process on the TWSS that opened on 22 March 2021 and concluded on 30 June 2021.  This process has ensured that any material overpayments of subsidies made to employers have either been paid back or are in the debt warehouse, to be paid back in the future. </p>  <p>  It is fair to say that the development of the TWSS was an ongoing process from its introduction by the Government in March 2020 to well beyond its expiry at the end of August 2020.  Revenue has confirmed to me that the delivery of the TWSS, which was a sophisticated and bespoke system that delivered wage subsidies to eligible employers for eligible employees, would not have been possible without the investment by Revenue in its PAYE Modernisation programme that was delivered over many months between 2016 and 2019.  </p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the exemplary work that went into the TWSS by my own officials and the staff in Revenue at what was an incredibly difficult time for our country. The success of these endeavours is evident from the fact that &euro;2.8 billion was paid to over 67,000 employers in respect of almost 690,000 employees. </p>  <p>  Finally, work is underway at senior official level on an inter-departmental basis to review the experience from the introduction and operation of Covid-19 emergency income supports paid to/in respect of people whose employment was impacted due to public health restrictions, and to identify lessons learnt.  My Department is represented on the relevant group which is chaired by the Department of Social Protection and also includes representatives from the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Enterprise Trade and Employment and from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme.   Another main aim of the policy underpinning the design of scheme is to help encourage the building of additional new properties.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question about extending the scheme to previously owned (but not occupied) properties, HTB is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties.  A move to include previously owned properties within the scope of the relief would be unlikely to improve its effectiveness; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply. I have no plans to amend the scheme in this regard. </p>  <p>  However, in my Budget 2022 address, I announced an extension of HTB for a further year until the end of 2022 and also that a formal review of the scheme would take place in 2022. The intention is that the HTB extension will allow time for the other Housing for All measures with similar policy objectives to be put in place in the period ahead.  It is also the intention that the review that I mention will be fundamental in nature and that it will help inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022.</p>  <p>  Issues related to the terms of reference and a specific timeline for completion as well as the question of who will carry out the review are being considered by my Department at present and the matter is expected to be moved forward shortly. </p></reply>

In addition to these projects, an important element of the administrative arrangements of the relocation Scheme was the establishment of a unique and once-off scheme of remedial works for identified engineering solutions for eligible homes for which there is no other funding source. To date, remedial works have been identified to protect some 19 homes from future flooding and work is continuing to explore possible engineering solutions for a further 3 homes. </p><p>Where an engineering solution is not feasible, based on best available information at the time of each decision, the OPW offers financial assistance towards relocation to a replacement home, equivalent to the cost to the relevant local authority, on a like for like basis. </p><p>To date,<b></b>29<b></b>homeowners have received formal offers of financial assistance for relocation, with a further 2 applications being considered. Of these, 14 homeowners have now completed the process, at a cost of &euro;3.46m, which has enabled them to relocate and purchase or build a replacement home under the Scheme. </p><p>The information requested by the Deputy on a County basis, if provided, presents a risk that individual homeowners could be identified.

It commits to an examination of defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing&rsquo;s report, &quot;Safe as Houses ?&quot;. Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates this commitment. </p><p>In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings take place to advance elements of the work. </p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  The full terms of reference of the Working Group are to: </p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>- Identification and description of defect,</p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected,</p><p>- Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>- Location of dwellings affected.</p><p>3. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.</p><p>4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.</p><p>In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.</p><p>5. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.</p><p>6. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>7. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>8. Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the first round of stakeholder consultation commenced in July 2021 with more detailed follow up and additional stakeholder consultations ongoing at present. A series of online surveys was also launched by the Working Group on 31 January seeking the experiences of homeowners, landlords, Directors of Owners&rsquo; Management Companies and Property Management Agents. The surveys will run until 14 March 2022 and can be accessed at the following link:<i>www.gov.ie/en/consultation/7e319-online-survey-in-relation-to-defects-in-apartment-and-duplex-buildings/</i></p><p>The engagement with stakeholders and the online consultation will inform the deliberations of the Working Group and support the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and finalisation of its report. </p><p>I am satisfied that the Working Group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter, and will require sufficient time to complete its work beyond March 2022. In that context, I look forward to a report later this year following completion of their consultations and deliberations. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p></reply>

This ensured that there were no barriers to students completing their ITE programme and graduating as planned in 2020 and in 2021.  </p>  <p>  Both my Department and other key stakeholders expect that Irish language courses in the Gaeltacht for student teachers will be in a position to resume in the traditional manner this year.</p>  <p>  While the primary responsibility for the overall administration of Gaeltacht-based Irish language courses rests with the relevant Gaeltacht college authorities &ndash;  both the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and my Department together play a key role in overall support of the sector.

This new, and temporary policy, was introduced in light of the epidemiological situation regarding the spread of COVID-19 at the time. </p>  <p>  The letter sent to schools by the CMO stated that NPHET has recommended, on a temporary basis, the wearing of face masks for children aged 9 years and over on public transport, in retail and other indoor public settings as currently required for those aged 13 and over, with exemptions as appropriate; and in third class and above in primary school. </p>  <p>  The Department published a frequently asked questions guidance on Monday 6 December 2021 to assist schools engage with parents where there are particular difficulties arose for individual children.  Where issues arise, schools will engage pragmatically and sensitively with parents to explore any particular difficulties arising for an individual child.  The FAQ can be found at the following link here </p>  <p>  The guidance recognises that in the case of certain children with additional needs, schools may be already aware of difficulties they may face in the appropriate use of face coverings. Schools will be best placed to identify those children whose complex needs are such that the wearing of face covering may not be possible for them, and to discuss this with parents as required. </p>  <p>  In the case of children who have a hearing impairment and or reply on lip reading, the guidance provides for schools to use visors or consider other solutions that do not present an impediment to communication. </p>  <p>  Public Health have also confirmed that current infection prevention and control measures in place in schools at this time will be reviewed by mid-term in February.</p></reply>

The means test for IQA is assessed on the qualified adult&rsquo;s means, solely or jointly held (50% of jointly-held means).  </p>  <p>  Where a qualified adult is assessed with weekly means of less than &euro;100, the maximum rate of IQA is payable.  Where assessable weekly means are over &euro;100 and not more than &euro;310, a tapering reduced rate of IQA is payable.  If the qualified adult has means of more than &euro;310 per week, this exceeds the means limit and there is no entitlement to an IQA payment.</p>  <p>  Based on the information provided by the person concerned, the couple&rsquo;s means were jointly-held prize bonds (date of issue 27 October 2020) and joint bank account.  The initial IQA assessment was based on 50% of the jointly-held prize bonds and the full amount of capital in the bank account, resulting in a means assessment of &euro;330 per week. As this exceeded the weekly means limit of &euro;310 per week, the person concerned was notified in writing on 10 August 2021 that there was no entitlement to IQA and provided with a breakdown of the means assessment. </p>  <p>  This means assessment was revised on 24 August 2021 following contact from the person concerned. Since the bank account is in joint names, the IQA means assessment should only have included half of the balance rather than the full amount.  The revised means assessment was then under the &euro;310 weekly limit and gave entitlement to a reduced rate of IQA. The revised decision issued in writing to the person concerned on 24 August 2021 and included a breakdown of the means assessment. </p>  <p>  The person concerned then provided an updated bank statement for the couple&rsquo;s joint bank account and prize bonds with a more recent date of issue (17 November 2021) in the person&rsquo;s sole name. The qualified adult's name was no longer on the prize bonds.  Where a Deciding Officer notes a transfer of assets by a person in respect of whom a means-tested increase for a qualified adult is being claimed, they will carefully consider all of the facts and circumstances in the individual case. If it is considered that applicants have disposed of assets to qualify for the means-tested IQA, or to qualify for a higher rate of payment, these assets remain assessable.  The Deciding Officer therefore assessed half of the bank account balance and half of the prize bonds previously declared, as the prize bonds were the joint property of the couple and in both their names at the time of application.  A decision issued in writing to the person concerned on 28 January 2022 with details of the means assessed and affording right of appeal of the decision within 21 days.</p>  <p>  If the person concerned wishes to request a further review, they should provide documentary evidence for the disposal of the jointly-held prize bonds which were issued in the couple&rsquo;s names on 27 October 2020.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

in this context and there is no statutory mechanism or framework for the Minister to consider or measure whether a worker&rsquo;s illness payments are adequate or not.  </p><p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has found that, historically, the modified rate of PRSI was applied to non-manual/officer roles in public bodies and, normally, their illness payment scheme allows for a higher level of illness payments than the level provided for manual/non-officer grades.  The Chief Appeals Officer decided in 2018 that the higher level illness payment scheme sets the bar for what should be considered adequate under the provisions of the 1996 regulations.  Accordingly, this is the basis on which the Department now determines the insurability of public service workers.  This means that anyone not covered by the higher level of illness payments, on 5 April 1995, in a public body would not be covered by the modified rate under article 83(1)(a).</p><p><b>Article 83(1)(b)</b>covers persons who, on 5 April 1995, were employed:</p><p>- under a local or other public authority to which the Local Government (Superannuation Revision) (Consolidation) Scheme 1986 (S.I. 391 of 1986) applies</p><p>- in a capacity which was not permanent and pensionable Class D can apply to such persons if they subsequently cease to be so employed and immediately become employed (that is, without any break in service):</p><p>- under any such local or other public authority</p><p>- in a permanent and pensionable capacity</p><p>- and are covered by illness payments considered adequate by the Minister,</p><p>It is important to note that, if the employment was permanent and pensionable on 5 April 1995, the provisions of article 83(1)(b) do not apply to them.</p><p><b>Article 83(1)(c)</b>covers persons who, on 5 April 1995, were employed:</p><p>- under a public authority to which the Local Government (Superannuation Revision) (Consolidation) Scheme 1986 (S.I. 391 of 1986) does <b>not</b>apply</p><p>- in a capacity which was not permanent and pensionable</p><p>Class D can apply to such persons if they subsequently cease to be so employed and immediately become employed (that is, without any break in service):</p><p>- under that public authority </p><p>- in a permanent and pensionable capacity</p><p>- and are covered by illness payments considered adequate by the Minister,</p><p>Again, it is important to note that, if the employment was permanent and pensionable on 5 April 1995, the provisions of article 83(1)(c) do not apply to them.</p><p><b>Specific rules for continuation of modified rate </b></p><p>A limited category of public service employees who are on the modified rate may retain their modified status after they change employment. </p><p>Under the 1996 regulations, persons to whom the modified rates applied on 5 April 1995, may continue on the modified rate when they change employment, without a break in service, to another employment that also qualifies for the modified rates, that is, an employment:</p><p>(a) - in the civil service in a pensionable post, </p><p>(b) - as a member of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na</p><p>(c) - in a commissioned rank of the Permanent Defence Force</p><p>(d) - as a member of the Army Nursing Service</p><p>(e) - in a local or other public authority, which:</p><p>- is permanent</p><p>- is pensionable </p><p>- provides for payments during illness on a basis considered adequate by the Minister</p><p>(f) - in other specified public service employments with specified conditions (eg statutory transport authorities, teachers, work in voluntary hospitals etc).</p><p>Only people who were on the modified rate on 5 April 1995 may retain this status when they change employment to one of the employments listed above.  A person who became a modified contributor after 5 April 1995 (under article 83(1)(b) or article 83(1)(c)) cannot retain the modified status after the specified employment ceases. </p><p>Any queries in relation to the correct class of PRSI applicable should be directed to Scope Section of the Department of Social Protection by e-mail to Scope@welfare.ie or phone +353 (0)1 6732585.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Where an application is disallowed, it is open to the person to re-apply if there is a change in their circumstances.   </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, discretionary payments can be made to help people with the cost of heating their homes.  A Heating Supplement may be paid to assist people with exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity who cannot meet those costs. My Department also provides discretionary Exceptional Needs Payments to people who face difficulties in meeting fuel bills.</p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices. To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has recently announced additional expenditure measures of &euro;505 m.  As part of these measures, I announced an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 to households in receipt of the fuel allowance payment. It is expected that the additional lump sum will be paid in March at an estimated cost of &euro;49 m. </p>  <p>  I note that the Deputy has agreed with my officials that information in relation to household type need not be included in this response. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This marked an important milestone in a process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland that has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the Convention in 2007. Ireland submitted its Initial State Report on the implementation of the UNCRPD to the UN Committee in November 2021 and we look forward to receiving a review date from the UN Committee in due course to evaluate our progress to date. </p>  <p>  The current model for meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is through delivery of two whole-of-government national strategies -the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES). My Department is also working on the development of a UNCRPD Implementation Plan, which is a Programme for Government commitment. </p>  <p>  I very am aware of the disproportionate employment and poverty challenges faced by people with disabilities in Ireland and Government is committed to addressing those challenges. </p>  <p>  The issue of employment is receiving dedicated attention in the context of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities, for which the Phase 3 Action Plan  is presently in development. The CES&rsquo;s strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide coordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers.</p>  <p>  Under the CES, my Department is funding the Employers for Change project which provides support to employers to recruit and retain people with disabilities.  My Department is also bringing forward legislative proposals in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill to increase the target for employment of people with disabilities in the public sector from 3% to 6% by 2024. </p>  <p>  In relation to the disproportionate costs and expenses suffered by people with disabilities, the Minister for Social Protection published  the Cost of Disability Report in December.  The Report was prepared by Indecon International Research Economists. It provides important evidence of the additional costs that people with a disability face in their day-to-day lives, and it was considered by the NDIS Steering Group (NDISSG) in December 2021, within 24 hours of publication.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to use research into the cost of disability to properly inform the direction of future policy. As the evidence in the Cost of Disability in Ireland report has implications for many areas of public policy, a whole-of-government approach is required to develop appropriate and timely responses and to ensure that everyday costs are reduced for people with disabilities and their families. By way of early action on this, in Budget 2022 Government increased the earnings limit on Disability Allowance  by &euro;25 from &euro;350 to &euro;375 and the weekly means disregard will increase from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60 in June 2022.</p></reply>

This marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services.</p><p>The Expert Group report informed the transformative package of measures for the sector committed in Budget 2022.</p><p>Budget 2022 announced a once-off Transition Fund for ELC and SAC providers to be paid in the period between the cessation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the introduction of the new Core Funding stream. </p><p>Between May and August 2022, ELC and SAC providers will have access to this Transition Fund. The primary conditionality attached to access the Transition Fund will be that providers do not increase their fees above levels charged in September 2021. </p><p>A weekly value will be determined for each service based on their location, size and service type.  Services will receive this funding in respect of the weeks during which they are open.  There will be a simple application process for providers which will be available in April.</p><p>The basis for calculating the Transition Fund will be different from the Revenue-administered EWSS. Further communications will issue to ELC and SAC providers in the coming weeks.</p><p>Budget 2022 also announced the new Core Funding stream. Core Funding will operate from September 2022 to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability.</p><p>Core Funding will be available to registered ELC and SAC providers, including full day care providers, ECCE-only providers, and stand-alone school-age providers, subject to the service agreeing to come into contract for the scheme. It will be a payment directly to services who choose to participate in the scheme.</p><p>The total available budget for Core Funding is equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full programme year, contingent on an Employment Regulation Order being agreed by the Joint Labour Committee. Core Funding will be allocated to services based on their capacity and the qualifications of those working in a service in line with the following three elements, with the majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;172 million of the &euro;207 million) distributed via the first of these elements.</p><p><b>1. Main Base Rate</b></p><p>Number of child places in an age group * Value based on ratio that applies to age group * Hours of operation per week * Weeks open per year</p><p><b>2. Graduate Lead Educator Uplift</b></p><p>Applied at room level, scaling in line with hours per week and weeks per year group is operating (Maximum one Graduate Lead Educator uplift per ELC room)</p><p><b>3. Graduate Manager Uplift</b></p><p>Applied at service level, scaling in line with hours per week and weeks per year service is operating (Maximum one Graduate Manager uplift per service)</p><p>Higher levels of funding will be available for capacity for younger children, to support the higher operating costs for these children arising from the higher staff ratio requirements.</p><p>Participation in Core Funding for ELC and SAC providers will require a commitment not to increase fees to parents from September 2021 rates in return for the increased State funding. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents feel the full affordability benefits of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. Services will also be required to offer the NCS and/or the ECCE programme to all eligible children/parents, in line with their operations.</p><p>Services will also be invited to report on the quality development measures they are pursuing.</p><p>The values for places for children of different ages offered by a service take into account the regulatory requirements. Under the Regulations, the number of places a service can offer depends on the size of rooms and the age of the children. It also depends on the number of staff present, with staff:child ratio requirements linked to the age of children. Services will declare the capacity they offer and a Core Funding value will be calculated based on that capacity.  A service&rsquo;s Core Funding will then scale depending on the opening hours and weeks of the service.</p><p>The structure of Core Funding is based on the recommendations of the Expert Group on the new funding model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare. Structuring it in this way means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children's attendance. </p><p>Core Funding is designed to operate alongside the existing funding schemes, including the ECCE programme and the NCS, subject to enhancements including those outlined above. Therefore, the NCS will continue to provide subsidies for children in attendance and ECCE will continue to provide capitation.</p><p>A Ready Reckoner to support services to determine the potential value of Core Funding to their service will be available in early March along with further communications to the sector about the funding and the full contract requirements.</p><p>The level of investment being made available for Core Funding is an acknowledgement that high quality ELC and SAC costs more than the current income to the sector. The aim of Core Funding is to allow providers&rsquo; costs to increase to improve quality but to ensure these costs are not passed onto parents in fees and that services are not made unsustainable.  </p><p>This is part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to realising the First 5 target of investment of approximately &euro;1 billion by 2028.

I initiated a pre-JLC process in December 2020, and Kevin Duffy was appointed to chair and facilitate this. The process provided stakeholders with an opportunity to express their views and to debate the implications of a system of regulating pay and conditions of employment in the sector. </p>  <p>  It was generally accepted that additional public funding is the only viable means by which the problem of inadequate pay levels can be addressed. The report on the pre-JLC process states that if additional funding is to become available so as to assist in providing ELC and SAC workers with pay rates that are commensurate with the requirements of their job, it is imperative that arrangements are in place to ensure that it is used for that purpose. It also states that all parties who participated in the process of engagement agreed that the establishment of a JLC is the most appropriate means by which pay and conditions of employment in the sector can be addressed.</p>  <p>  I was happy to see this result in an Establishment Order being signed by Minister English which came into effect in July and JLC members being appointed in November. This JLC is now meeting and considering the issues.</p>  <p>  Separately, an Expert Group was established in September 2019 to develop a new funding model for ELC and SAC. Their report, Partnership for the Public Good: A new Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, was published on 7 December 2021 following consideration by Government and acceptance of its 25 recommendations. Work has now commenced on implementation of these recommendations.</p>  <p>  I was very happy to have had the opportunity to meet the chair of the Expert Group in advance of the Estimates process to allow the emerging recommendations of the Group to inform the package of measures announced in Budget 2022. </p>  <p>  In particular, a new Core Funding stream for services to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability and the drawing up of an ERO is being introduced and will be worth up to &euro;69 million for a part year (September-December) in 2022, equivalent to &euro;207 million in full year costs.</p>  <p>  Partnership for the Public Good acknowledges the risk of the JLC failing to put in place an ERO, and suggests not proceeding with the extra funding for Core Funding to support the JLC in that event.  The report also emphasises that the main risk of failing to tackle staff pay and conditions is the impact on quality for children it would have.</p>  <p>  Given that part of the objective of Core Funding is to support an ERO, if one is not agreed, Core Funding as announced in Budget 2022 cannot proceed. Approximately two thirds of the funding for Core Funding is intended to contribute to improved pay rates across different categories of staff. </p>  <p>  This portion of the budget cannot be made available without assurances that this funding will be channelled towards achieving the intended policy objective of improved pay rates in the ELC and SAC sector. Core Funding is therefore largely contingent on an ERO being agreed. </p>  <p>  I understand that the parties involved in the JLC are working intensively together to agree an ERO. Officials in my Department have been supporting this process by providing data and addressing technical queries from the JLC. </p>  <p>  I am very hopeful that the parties to the JLC will come to an agreement, given the very substantial public funding available and the importance of improving staff pay. </p></reply>

In considering the important role played by apprenticeship in responding to these needs, it should be noted that apprenticeship is an employer-led offering. The number of apprentices in any specific sector is, therefore, determined directly by employer demand.</p><p>There are currently 62 apprenticeship programs available ranging from levels 5-10 on the National Framework of qualifications. These range in duration from 2 -4 years. Craft apprenticeships account for 25 of the 62 existing available apprenticeship programmes. They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases. The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities.</p><p>For Craft Apprenticeships, the off the job training for phase 2 in ETB Training centres typically consists of 22 weeks training. Off the job training in phases 4 and 6 for craft apprenticeships which takes place in Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities is usually 10 &ndash; 12 weeks in duration </p><p>For consortia led apprenticeships such as accounting technicians, an apprentice will be attending (off-the job training) at college one day a week and working with an employer four days during college term time. Outside of college terms, apprentices work with their employer 5 days a week.</p><p>Other consortia type apprenticeships such as the Telecommunications &amp;amp; Data Network Technician apprenticeship, off the job training typically involves blocks of several weeks in duration where apprentices train in colleges full time with the rest of the apprenticeship being spent with their employer .</p><p>Registrations on apprenticeship programmes in 2021 were the highest they have been since 2007. In 2021, 8,607 apprentices were employed, on 62 programmes. 6,955 of these registrations were in the traditional craft apprenticeship programmes, with over 60% of these registrations on the three Electrical, Plumbing and Carpentry and Joinery crafts. The current population of apprentices is c24, 212, the highest it has been since 2009.</p><p>A full list of apprentice registrations in 2021 for all apprenticeships is attached.</p><p>Further information on all apprenticeships is available on the apprenticeship.ie website.</p><p>/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2022-02-17_pq243_en.xlsx">Apprenticeships</p></reply>

The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI to determine. </p>  <p>  In assessing an application for the 2022/23 academic year, SUSI will have regard to the following qualifying criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant: </p>  <p>  1. The student must qualify for the standard rate of grant;</p>  <p>  2. Total gross reckonable income for the 2021 tax year, after income disregards and Child Dependant Increase(s) are excluded, must not exceed &euro;24,500;</p>  <p>  3. As at 31st December 2021, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in Schedule 2 of the Student Grant Scheme 2022.</p>  <p>  The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education made detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students.  The target group of "those most in need" was defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, to effectively target this cohort, the income limit for the special rate of grant is aligned to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension plus the maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years. The student grant means test for 2022 is based on gross reckonable income for the 2021 tax year. As the Department of Social Protection state pension payment was not increased in Budget 2021, the special rate income threshold remains at &euro;24,500 for the 2022 Scheme. The income threshold for the special rate of grant is strategically aligned with the highest Department of Social Protection rate as described in order to target students from households in receipt of long term social welfare assistance effectively.</p>  <p>  However, the special rate of grant payment itself was increased by &euro;200 as part of Budget 2022, along with all other student grant rates. For the 2022/23 academic year, the special rate of grant is payable at the non-adjacent rate of &euro;6,115 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,575, depending on the distance from ordinary residence to the college attended.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Applications will be accepted for six months until 31 July, when the scheme will close.</p>  <p>  This once-in-a-generation scheme is designed to give long-term undocumented people without a current permission to remain in the State, the chance to regularise their status, access the labour market and begin their path to citizenship.</p>  <p>  Almost 2,000 applications have been received so far. This is a very positive start and I encourage anyone who may be eligible to apply.</p>  <p>  The criteria for the scheme have been designed in line with the Programme for Government commitment, which is to bring forward a regularisation scheme to create new pathways for long-term undocumented people and their dependents. The period of four years undocumented residence, or three years in the case of applicants with children, is consistent with this commitment and has been approved by Government. This is a once-off, time bound scheme that is expected to benefit thousands of undocumented people living in Ireland. There are no plans to extend the eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  Anyone who has previously held an EU Treaty Rights (EUTR) permission and who currently has a temporary permission to remain in the State while their application under the relevant legislation is being considered or is at review stage,  would not be considered to be undocumented. Therefore, they will not meet the criteria for the Scheme.</p>  <p>  People whose EUTR applications are currently in a process that will decide their future status within the State, will be granted permissions under the EU Regulations e.g. 5 years residence or permanent residence, if successful.  This includes people who currently have applications at EUTR review stage. As a result, people in the EUTR process already have a means to decide their future status in the State. </p></reply>

Applications will be accepted for six months until 31 July, when the scheme will close.  The scheme includes a parallel strand, which opened for applications on 7 February 2022, to implement the recommendation included in the report of the Expert Advisory Group, allowing international protection applicants who have an outstanding application for international protection and have been in the asylum process for a minimum of two years to apply.  </p>  <p>  This once-in-a-generation scheme is designed to give long-term undocumented people without a current permission to remain in the State, the chance to regularise their status, access the labour market and begin their path to citizenship.  As the Deputy will be aware, it has been widely welcomed by those who have long campaigned for this right. </p>  <p>  As I have outlined, the criteria for the international protection strand of the scheme have been designed in line with the recommendation made in the Report of the Catherine Day Expert Advisory Group.

This includes the identification of Traveller Liaison teachers to support greater access and adaptation of education services for Travellers and awareness training for prison staff on issues arising for Travellers. </p>  <p>  The mediation programme, a partnership between Prison Education schools, Midlands Traveller Conflict Mediation Initiative, the Red Cross and Travellers in Prison Initiative, is in place in a number of prisons.  The programme is facilitated by Travellers and aims to develop intervention skills to address some of the issues that can lead to person on person violence in prisons. The programme develops conflict awareness and is an effective way of resolving disputes and a number of prisoners are trained as mediators.</p>  <p>  Under a partnership between the Irish Red Cross, the Prison Service and the Education and Training Boards of Ireland,  the Community Based Health and First Aid programme is currently in operation across our prisons.  This is a peer led programme to train inmate Irish Red Cross volunteers about community health. Each year, inmate volunteers are guided through a community assessment which aims to identify the main health issues in their prison community. Their role as volunteers is to develop projects aimed at improving those issues. Volunteers learn in the classroom and educate their peers on the landings. To date, over 1,500 prisoners have trained in Community Based Health and First Aid, many of whom are members of the Traveller Community.  </p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, the Red Cross Volunteers played a pivotal role in promoting awareness and understanding of infection control and vaccine awareness to all prisoners, including the publication of traveller-specific newsletters and posters.  </p>  <p>  In late 2020, the Prison Service in collaboration with the equine industry opened the Equine Centre at Castlerea Prison.  The equine programme while open to all prisoners, early indications show a positive interest in this programme from Traveller men.  It is specially designed for delivery to students with literacy issues and is delivered visually with voice over and assisted with the use of diagrams.  It is an accredited programme endorsed by the Racing Academy and Centre of Education.   </p>  <p>  Prisoners face many barriers to successful integration back into society and the equine programme can have a positive impact on physical and mental wellbeing, offer preparation for employment and ultimately make the community safer through a reduction in reoffending.  </p></reply>

The International Protection Office (IPO) of my Department has recently written to approximately 4,000 potentially eligible applicants inviting them to apply under the scheme.</p>  <p>  Further information on this strand of the scheme, along with the application form can be found on the IPO website at: www.ipo.gov.ie/en/ipo/pages/whatsnew. When completed, application forms and supporting documentation should be submitted by email to IPRSU@ipo.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  Currently, information for the scheme on the IPO website is only available in English. However,  arrangements are being made by my Department to translate this material into the five most common languages currently used by international protection applicants. IPO staff will also assist applicants as needed to help them submit their application in the correct manner. </p>  <p>  There is no fee for making an application under this dedicated strand of the scheme. Applications will be assessed independently of the application that has been made for international protection.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no requirement for the applicant to withdraw their international protection application, although some applicants may choose to do so, if successful under this scheme. Applicants who are successful and who do not choose to withdraw from the international protection process will continue to have their protection applications processed. </p>  <p>  It is not considered that the making of an application under the Scheme is itself a matter for which legal advice is necessary. International protection applicants can and do avail of the services of the Legal Aid Board in relation to their international protection application.  While legal aid is not specifically being provided for this scheme, it is open to applicants to consult their legal representative, if they have one. In particular, they may wish to seek advise on whether or not  they wish to withdraw their pending application for international protection, if successful under the scheme. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-02-17a.694.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022021700072#WRM05000"><p>My thoughts are with the victims of the recent horrific attacks in their own homes. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting criminal investigations so the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment in detail on the specifics of any individual case.  However I utterly condemn these senseless and cowardly attacks and also belive that the perpetrators must be brought to justice. </p>  <p>  Incidents like these, although rare, are terrifying, not only for the victim themselves but for the entire community.  Home is the one place we should all be able to feel safe, and fear in one&rsquo;s own home is something that can never be tolerated.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department is committed to ensuring that there is strong, visible community policing right across both rural and urban Ireland.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and detecting crime. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  This year&rsquo;s winter phase of Operation Thor was launched by Garda&iacute; in October 2021 and is designed to tackle burglaries and associated criminal activities, which often increase in the darker winter months, through targeted enforcement and crime prevention activity and information.</p>  <p>  This annual focus from Operation Thor has proved highly successful in tackling property related crime since its inception in November 2015.  In 2015, there were in excess of 18,800 residential burglaries reported. By contrast, to the end of 2021 there were just over 6,000 residential burglaries reported, a reduction of over 66% or approximately 13,000 less residential burglaries.</p>  <p>  While the COVID-19 pandemic was clearly a factor in some of this reduction, with people more likely to be present in their homes throughout the day, there has been a marked and consistent downward trend in such offences since the introduction of this Garda focus through Operation Thor.</p>  <p>  The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels, with an allocation in excess of &euro;2 billion for 2022, including funding for the recruitment of up to 800 additional Garda trainees and up to 400 Garda staff. This significant investment demonstrates the Government's commitment to increasing the Garda workforce to enable the organisation to keep our communities safe. To this end, the Deputy will be aware that a new Garda recruitment competition opened last week and I would encourage anyone with an interest in a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply.</p>  <p>  In addition to new recruits, the rollout of the new Garda Operating Model will support the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from non-core duties to frontline policing across the country. The new model will see larger Divisions with more resources, increased Garda visibility in communities, a wider range of locally delivered policing services, and a strong focus on community policing.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also allocated &euro;12m for investment in the Garda fleet, which means more high visibility policing in our towns and cities. This continuing investment is intended to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet and that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  </p>  <p>  My Department has for many years provided funding for the employment and associated costs of the national Community Alert Programme, including the employment of regional Development Officers. In 2021, my Department committed in the region of &euro;150,000 to local communities who wish to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running their local Text Alert Scheme, which is administered by Muintir na T&iacute;re. This is a continuation of the annual funding made available by the Department for the Text Alert Rebate scheme each year since 2016.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, while community policing is a central feature of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that is reinforced in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, that report also highlighted that policing and crime prevention are not the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department alone.</p>  <p>  To achieve better outcomes, supported by a strong inter-agency collaboration and community engagement, three pilot Local Community Safety Partnerships have been established. These Partnerships will provide a dedicated communication channel for input and the development of Local Community Safety Plans to reflect and respond to the self-identified needs of that community.</p>  <p>  In addition, I will launch the Community Safety Innovation Fund in the coming weeks, which will enable local communities to seek funding for innovative projects which will improve community safety in their areas.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also be aware that the Department of Rural and Community Development funds the Senior Alert Scheme, which provides grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms for persons aged 65 or older and of limited means. The objective of the Seniors Alert Scheme is to encourage community support for vulnerable older people in our communities through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable them to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind. I am advised that the grant assistance is made available through community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations that are registered with Pobal.</p></reply>

There is also a constitutional presumption in favour of the grant of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, a referendum took place in 1996 on a proposed amendment to the Constitution to allow the courts to refuse bail where there are grounds for believing that the accused will commit serious offences while on bail. The referendum was passed by the People and section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is considered by the Court necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Subsequent to this, the law on bail has been further strengthened on three occasions, specifically in the Criminal Justice Act 2007, the Criminal Justice Act 2015 and the Criminal Justice Act 2017.    </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the amended bail laws have proven to be effective and I can inform the Deputy there are no immediate plans to introduce further bail legislation. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made important progress in suppressing the threat of serious and organised crime and there has been significant successes achieved in this area through intelligence-led operations. I can assure the Deputy that there will be no let-up in the pressure being brought to bear on those involved in organised crime.</p>  <p>  The Government has supported An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in addressing the threat from organised crime gangs through the introduction of legislative measures such as:</p>  <p>  - The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016 which provides additional Garda powers for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them being disposed of.  </p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 providing for the establishment and operation of the DNA database providing Garda&iacute; with links between people and unsolved crimes.</p>  <p>  - The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, introduced to protect the justice system from being subverted by criminal groups, including potential intimidation of juries. </p>  <p>  - By continuing to grow the strength of the Garda organisation, with a budget of over &euro;2 billion in 2022, providing for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda&iacute; and 400 Garda staff this year. </p>  <p>While it is not possible to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy in respect of the granting of bail to members of organised crime gangs (as this information is not available to the Courts Service) the Deputy may be aware, that the Central Statistics Office regularly publishes both prison and probation re-offending statistics on their website www.cso.ie  .</p>  <p>  According to the latest release of the Prison Re-offending Statistics 2011 &ndash; 2018, published in June 2021, out of the 1,323 persons who re-offended within a year of release in 2018, over a half (50.6%) re-offended in just two offence groups - theft (331) or public order related offences (339).</p>  <p>  The latest Probation Re-offending Statistics 2017, published on 19 November 2021, indicate that of the 1,368 individuals that re-offended within a year of receiving their probation orders in 2017, individuals were most likely to re-offend with an offence linked to Road and Traffic offences (23%), public order and other social code offences (22%), theft and related offences (17%), controlled drug offences (13%) and Offences against Government, justice procedures and organisation of crime (9%).</p>  <p>  Further detailed statistical information can found at the CSO website statistics section at People and Society - Crime and Justice.</p>  <p>  Non-custodial penalties, particularly supervised community sanctions, play a significant and important role in addressing criminality, reducing reoffending and providing a degree of protection to the public and this is supported by CSO figures on recidivism.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government 2020 contains a broad range of policies and proposals that represent a coherent approach to enhancing and sustaining a more just and safe society with a specific commitment to review policy options for prison and penal reform.</p>  <p>  A High Level Working Group is taking forward the Government&rsquo;s commitment to review policy options for prison and penal reform and I expect to publish the report from the group shortly.</p>  <p>  This work will build on a number of initiatives that have been introduced over the past decade to reduce reoffending, including Community Return and Community Support Schemes and the Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC).</p>  <p>  In terms of future legislation, the Deputy may wish to note that it is my intention in the forthcoming Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to raise the maximum penalty for the offence of &lsquo;conspiracy to murder&rsquo; from a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment to potential life imprisonment. This Bill is currently with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and I hope to be in a position to publish it in quarter 2 of this year. </p></reply>

A concerted effort has been made over the past two years to ensure that the detection and prevention of these types of criminal activity have not been adversely affected by the unprecedented demands placed on policing services by the vital enforcement of public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Garda operations aimed at preventing and countering criminal activity, and the enforcement of legislation pertaining to illegal drugs. As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. The Bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide, and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities. GNDOCB also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners. Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other state agencies to tackle the problems of drug addiction and abuse.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy "Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025". This strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland. The implementation of the strategy is led by my colleague, the Minister for Health, however, the strategy includes actions for all stakeholders, including my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p>  <p>  The strategy recognises the need for a balanced health-led approach - reducing demand, while also reducing access to illegal drugs, and is aimed at reducing the number of people criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use. While this strategy supports vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strengthened enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs. Sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has continued unabated throughout the pandemic, bringing significant convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs, firearms and ammunition.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that on 2 July 2021, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na commenced an enhanced national anti-drugs strategy, Operation Tara, which has a strong focus on tackling street-level dealing throughout rural and urban Ireland. The focus of Operation Tara is to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels - international, national and local - involved in the importation, distribution, cultivation, production, local sale and supply of controlled drugs.</p>  <p>  Recent successes of Operation Tara include:</p>  <p>  - Garda&iacute; attached to the Divisional Drugs Unit in Drogheda conducted a search in the Legavoureen area of Drogheda and seized more than &euro;247,000 worth of Diazepam tablets on Wednesday, 24 November 2021;</p>  <p>  - From 30th November to 3 December 2021, Garda&iacute; in Wicklow, led by the Wicklow Divisional Drugs Unit, searched 26 locations in the county following an extensive investigation targeting the sale and supply of controlled drugs. 19 persons were charged and 12 youths were referred to the Garda Youth Diversion Programme.</p>  <p>  - GNDOCB, assisted by other specialised units, undertook a particular operation designed to address drug-related issues being experienced in West Dublin and wider afield, including drug-related threat-to-life incidents and other forms of intimidation. On Wednesday 19 January 2022, 24 premises were searched, with &euro;700,000 in cash seized alongside 16 high value watches and eight vehicles. Six suspects were arrested in the course of the operation. </p>  <p>  - On Saturday 29 January 2022, Garda&iacute; searched three properties in Tallaght, Dublin 24. During the course of the searches four firearms were seized, along with silencers and ammunition. Garda&iacute; also seized approximately &euro;70,000 worth of suspected heroin as well as small quantities of crack cocaine and cannabis. Two men were arrested at the scene. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that in 2021, the GNDOCB seized &euro;63.689m in illicit drugs, and seized cash of &euro;5.6m and &pound;38,751 (UK). In addition, &euro;8.23m, &pound;142,520 (UK) and $23 (US) was forfeited to the State in 2021.</p>  <p>  All drugs seized are subject to analysis by Forensic Science Ireland (FSI).</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a similar measure for frontline staff in all nursing homes and hospices (whether public, private, voluntary, Section 39 etc.). This measure will address the specific challenges associated with making payment to these organisations including governance and scope.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently engaging in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment. Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. </p>  <p>  It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p></reply>

It also surveys people&rsquo;s attitudes and perceptions relating to tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use and records the impact of drug use on communities. The 2019&ndash;2020 NDAS collected information from 5,762 people aged 15 years and older across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Heath Research Board (HRB) published the 2019-2020 NDAS findings in July 2021. The findings show that, overall, the use of illegal drugs has remained at a similar level to that recorded in the 2014/15 survey, while an increase was seen in the use of cocaine and ecstasy. Cannabis is still the most prevalent illegal drug used in Ireland, but has also shown a decrease from 6.5% to 5.9% when compared to the 2014/15 survey. A significant decrease in the instances of Cannabis Use Disorder has also been recorded. </p>  <p>The HRB is current analysing the survey data by CHO and the results will be published in the coming months.</p>  <p>  I recently announced a &euro;2 million community services enhancement fund to enhance community-based drug and alcohol services. The aim of the fund is to enhance access to and delivery of drug and alcohol services in the community, which is a strategic priority for the national drugs strategy 2021-2025. </p>  <p>  I have allocated between &euro;200,000 and &euro;240,000 per annum to the nine community healthcare organisations (CHOs). The funding will be allocated on three-year cycle, with ongoing monitoring and evaluation, to ensure that services are effective in addressing the needs of people who use drugs and alcohol. Twenty-five percent of the funding allocations is ring-fenced to increase access to and the provision of drug and alcohol services for women, ethnic minorities and the LGBTI+ community. </p>  <p>  Profiling the drug and alcohol needs of the population across the CHO, including data from the NDAS, will enable the development of new services and the measurement of their impact over time. Already, we are seeing new drug &amp;amp; alcohol needs emerge, whether in the night-time economy, among young people, in disadvantaged communities or polydrug use.</p>  <p>  I believe that drug and alcohol services should be provided based on population needs, as this is both equitable and evidence-based. I also want services to be delivered in the community so that health care is closer to people&rsquo;s homes, as set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme. By integrating drug and alcohol services as part of community care, the health needs of people who use drugs can be better met and the stigma of drug and alcohol use can be reduced. These are practical steps to strengthen the health-led response to drug and alcohol use.</p>  <p>  I am also allocating &euro;850,000 for an initiative to reduce the health-related harms from cocaine and crack cocaine. This initiative will target disadvantaged communities that are worst affected by cocaine and crack cocaine and contribute to a whole of government response to the social determinants and consequences of drug use in these communities. </p>  <p>In June 2021 the Health Research Board (HRB) published the National Drug and Alcohol Survey 2019/20. This survey, which is funded by the Department of Health and managed by the HRB, provides information on alcohol, tobacco, and drug use amongst the general population in Ireland. Results of the survey can be found at the following link: www.drugsandalcohol.ie/34287/</p></reply>

Through the Cappagh Kids initiative, the National Orthopaedic Hospital provides additional capacity for the treatment of more routine paediatric orthopaedic patients, including some routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites. Total funding of &euro;1.65 million was provided for this initiative in 2021, and funding for 2022 is encompassed in the waiting list action plan. The National Orthopaedic Hospital estimates it will complete 640 non complex surgeries for CHI in 2022.</p>  <p>  Additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised my Department that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general paediatric orthopaedics in addition to consequential capacity gains for complex patient needs. In 2022 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.</p>  <p>  Last week I convened a meeting with the clinical teams from Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital, along with senior management from these hospitals and the HSE. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the draft paediatric orthopaedic waiting list plan and to ensure that an appropriate plan with ambitious and attainable activity levels was being produced. The plan will be funded in the context of the wider waiting list action plan for 2022 and will include additional activity to reduce the spinal orthopaedic waiting list through the use of theatres at Crumlin, Temple Street, and Cappagh, as well as additional capacity in the private sector. </p>  <p>  Last Friday I also went out to visit Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital to witness first hand the great work being done through the 'Cappagh Kids' programme. I met with the CEO and senior clinicians, including Mr Conor Green.  Cappagh have ambitious plans to develop the hospital to provide additional capacity for both adults and children. I welcome in particular the current proposal to enhance capacity for Cappagh Kids at the site, but I have asked that they look again at the proposals to ensure that we are sufficiently ambitious whilst remaining realistic around what can be achieved.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:</p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person</p>  <p>  - Bed and board</p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living</p>  <p>  - Laundry service</p>  <p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory). An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p>  <p>  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract. The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.</p>  <p>  Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.</p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is an independent statutory body with a dual mandate to enforce competition and consumer protection law in Ireland. CCPC&rsquo;s mission is to promote competition and enhance consumer welfare. The CCPC has published consumer protection guidelines for contracts of care in long-term residential care services for older people. The guidelines set out the obligations and responsibilities that providers must adhere to under consumer protection law and are aimed at providing greater transparency, clarity and certainty for consumers.</p></reply>

At present all children up to and including the age of 5 are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under in three phases: to children aged 6 and 7; to children aged 8 and 9; and to children aged 10,11 and 12. Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7. My officials and the HSE are already engaged in preparatory work, and I expect to be in a position to bring forward proposals to the IMO, representing GPs, later this quarter. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

Under the scope and parameters laid out in the EU DCC Regulation, DCCs for recovery are not currently issued on the basis of antigen tests. </p>  <p>  The EU Digital COVID Certificate is not a travel document or a requirement for travel, but a record of a medical event to help ease freedom of movement with the European Union.  Any persons who wishes to travel to another EU country or access services aboard should familiarise themselves with the travel requirements of that country. Details are available at the Re-Open EU webpage: reopen.europa.eu/en</p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The NIAC makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practices in relation to immunisation.</p>  <p>  There was very significant demand for PCR testing during December and into January due to unprecedented levels of infection in the community, largely driven by the Omicron variant and reflecting both the high prevalence of the disease and also other respiratory illnesses at the time. The HSE made every effort necessary to address this very significant demand arising for PCR testing. This included making arrangements with private providers to add new capacity, extending the opening hours of swabbing centres and ongoing recruitment and redeployment to swabbing teams, and increasing the number of National Ambulance Service mobile teams. Due to demands on PCR capacity reaching the levels they did, changes were necessary to public health guidance, making antigen tests more widely available and allowing the HSE to prioritise access to PCR testing for those most vulnerable to the disease.</p></reply>

We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle.</p>  <p>  Underscoring the government&rsquo;s commitment to Women&rsquo;s Health has been the establishment of a Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce in September 2019 to improve both health outcomes and experiences of healthcare for women and girls. The members of the Taskforce meet regularly, with its fifteenth meeting held in November 2021.</p>  <p>  An important part of the Taskforce&rsquo;s work is to listen to the voices of women and engage with stakeholders both at an individual and organisation level at home and abroad who can share evidence expertise and experiences and ideas to help us achieve this goal. The Taskforce has listened to, engaged, and worked with more than 2,000 women and hundreds of stakeholders and organisations representing women and girls across the country.</p>  <p>  We have made a specific commitment to supporting the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, including the development of a Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, to tackle a wide range of issues impacting women&rsquo;s health outcomes in Ireland.</p>  <p>  This Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan for 2022-2023 is currently being finalised and is expected to be brought before Government in the coming weeks.  This plan has been informed by the available evidence and engagement with women across the country, key stakeholders, clinicians, and advocates for women&rsquo;s health through the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan sets forward a wide range of positive initiatives to support women&rsquo;s health and provides a framework for further prioritisation as issues and needs arise.</p>  <p>  The commitment to Women&rsquo;s Health has been reflected within Budget 2022, in the allocation of &euro;31 million for new development funding to specifically support women&rsquo;s health.</p>  <p>  The Women&rsquo;s Health Fund was established in 2020 with a &euro;5 million allocation in Budget 2021. The additional &euro;5 million funding allocated to this Fund in Budget 2022 will allow us to continue to provide specific targeted funding on improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In relation to endometriosis, a number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the Taskforce in 2020, with the issue of endometriosis recognised and included as part of a priority workstream on improving gynaecological health for women and girls.</p>  <p>The endometriosis workstream identified a number of potential actions in this area, including enhanced services and supports and increased information and awareness. There has been significant work underway to reflect these actions in implementation, including direct investment in services which I will mention in further detail shortly, and a public webinar on endometriosis which was held on November 24th   2021.</p>  <p>  Information provided by the HSE indicates that endometriosis is a difficult condition to diagnose and treat because of the variation of presentations, impacting the physical and mental wellbeing of patients at varying levels. Treatment may include pain medications, hormone treatment and surgical interventions. The time to diagnose endometriosis varies by patient due to its varying and ambiguous symptom presentation. The HSE's National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.</p>  <p>  In relation to the treatment of endometriosis, I am advised that a GP referral to a gynaecologist is the standard pathway of care for the management of endometriosis in Ireland. This is similar to the pathway in place for the management of other gynaecological conditions.</p>  <p>  The  HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme  has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis. The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory, or see and treat, model, rather than the traditional outpatient referral model.  An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources.  It is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  As such, the Programme has developed an Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care which centres on the establishment of one-stop &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; ambulatory gynaecology clinics. An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources than the traditional outpatient model and it is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  Building on progress made in rolling out these ambulatory gynaecology clinics in 2020 and 2021, funding has been provided under Budget 2022 which will facilitate the establishment of additional ambulatory gynaecology clinics, thereby completing the implementation of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care. This will bring the total number of these clinics to 20 nationally.</p>  <p>  As part of the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, in April 2021, I announced the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital (TUH) to deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis, with particular focus on advanced and complex cases for which there had previously been no ready access in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Further to the above, funding provided under Budget 2022 will enable the expansion of the endometriosis service at TUH as well as the establishment of a new service for more complex endometriosis cases at Cork University Maternity Hospital</p>  <p>  The issue of endometriosis has also been highlighted through the nationwide &ldquo;Radical Listening&rdquo; exercise carried out by the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This exercise enabled women across the country to share their views and experiences of the health sector and health services. This was a large-scale consultation process intended to maximise the participation of women across all life stages from 18 years upwards, including minority and disadvantaged women.  278 women participated in open interviews and workshops. A report on the findings of the &lsquo;Radical listening&rsquo; exercise on September 14th can be found here:</p>  <p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/ebe3e-significant-milestone-as-minister-donnelly-publishes-a-report-of-womens-voices-on-womens-health-following-a-radical-listening-exercise-this-year/  </p></reply>

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which help to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. It should also be noted that since November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1050 for a couple. This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the current medical card income thresholds are kept under regular review and any changes are considered in the context of Government policy, the annual budgetary estimates process and other issues which may be relevant.</p></reply>

These Terms of Reference will be published once finalised by the Group.</p>  <p>  This Group will then progress a structured programme of ongoing consultative engagements with key sectoral stakeholders to further explore and define the issues, listen to stakeholder views, and identify approaches to respond to the strategic workforce challenges.</p>  <p>  The Group will provide a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address the workforce challenges in the sector and develop a report for my consideration outlining the Group&rsquo;s key findings, recommendations, and a proposed action plan to support implementation of these recommendations to include periodic monitoring of progress.</p>  <p>  Potential areas to be considered by the Group include recruitment, retention, training, and the career development of front-line carers in home support and nursing homes into the future.</p></reply>

A rise in input costs has affected all of the various horticulture sectors with energy and fertiliser experiencing the biggest rise in costs. The increase in input costs coupled with stagnant prices has resulted in a situation where a small number of field vegetable growers have recently made the decision to leave this sector as they feel it has become economically unsustainable to continue. My Department is monitoring the current situation. </p>  <p>  Through the Horticulture Industry Forum, my Department continues to work with the horticulture sector on some of the key issues that face this industry, including labour availability, increase in input costs and achieving sustainable prices for Irish produce. Minister of State for Horticulture Pippa Hackett, has recently commissioned a report on the horticulture industry. This report is due to be published at the end of March and aims to address the key issues currently being experienced by growers and to identify opportunities that exist to improve the outlook for this industry as a whole. It will provide a benchmark and a basis from which we can develop a new strategy for the sector. </p>  <p>  I want to reassure the Deputy of my continued support for horticulture growers through the scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector (current budget of &euro;9 million), and also via the EU Producer Organisation scheme for fruit and vegetables. </p></reply>

One of the intervention proposed therein is an agri-environment climate measure (AECM). &euro;1.5 billion has been allocated to this flagship agri-environment scheme which will be the successor to the Green Low Carbon Agri-environment Scheme (GLAS) which was available under Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that, similar to GLAS, all farmers throughout the country will have the possibility of applying to the new AECM Scheme. There are two approaches proposed in the new AECM: </p>  <p>  -  AECM General, available nationally (outside of the high priority geographical area as defined for the AECM Co-operation Project approach below), which offers a range of measures (both targeted and general); and</p>  <p>  -  AECM Co-operation Project, available to farmers in defined high priority geographical areas. Eight areas in the country have been defined as having particular environmental characteristics and farmers in those areas may engage in the new AECM through the cooperation project teams.  These eight areas comprise of land dominated by semi-natural vegetation (both privately owned and in commonage), Natura 2000 lands and in which priority water catchments, etc are located.

The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota to the UK by 2026.  This will only increase demands for a higher share of Ireland&rsquo;s Mackerel quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet. The Deputy should be aware that the 400 tonne limit for the hook and line fishery has not been reduced and has remained the same as in previous years.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the situation is that if there is an increase in the Mackerel quota for any sector in the allocation made available, such as for the hook and line fishery, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the TCA.</p></reply>

The policy is supported by 150 commitments across Government, which will address the challenges facing communities and deliver new opportunities for people living in rural areas.</p>  <p>  All my Department&rsquo;s policies are underpinned by extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders including rural and urban stakeholder groups, community groups, young people, Government Departments and State Agencies. </p>  <p>  This engagement process provides important insights into issues impacting on rural and urban communities and in identifying areas for response which are relevant to the work of my Department. Ongoing dialogue is maintained by my Department with rural and urban stakeholders in order to identify and respond to issues impacting on individuals and communities.  </p>  <p>  I will also continue to collaborate with my Government colleagues and will monitor the issues which impact our urban and rural communities in order to respond to emerging needs.</p></reply>

A feature of the LEADER programme is that it is based on a community-led, bottom-up approach to rural development.</p>  <p>  The programme includes specific funding themes to support rural economic development, enterprise development and job creation, social inclusion, and rural environment.  Community groups and rural-based businesses can apply for funding under these themes.  The website of the National Rural Network contains case studies of how LEADER has benefited local communities and businesses.   Over 5,000 projects have been approved for in excess of &euro;211 million under these themes since the 2014-2020 LEADER programme became operational.</p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in Our Rural Future, I launched the Transitional LEADER Programme which came into effect from 1 April 2021 and will run to the end of 2022. A total of &euro;70 million is being made available over this programming period. &euro;65 million of this budget is available to Local Action Groups (LAGs) who deliver the programme and approve projects at local level.  This allocation covers both core project expenditure and the administration and animation costs of the LAGs.  &euro;20 million of this Transitional LEADER Programme is funded by the European Union Recovery Instrument (EURI), which will enable local communities to recover from the impact of Covid-19, provide support for new and innovative projects in the green economy and maximise the potential of broadband and the digital economy in communities. </p>  <p>  In 2021 I also approved an increase in the rate of aid for private enterprises and commercial community projects, from a maximum of 50% to a maximum of 75% as committed to in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  The Transitional Programme will ensure that LEADER will continue to support and revitalise our communities and make them sustainable and desirable places in which to live and work through co-ordinated approaches that build on the economic strengths and infrastructure of rural areas.</p></reply>

I also increased the maximum grant available under the Scheme last year to &euro;500,000 to permit projects of additional scale to be funded. The assessment of the applications made under the 2021 scheme is now being finalised and I expect to be in a position to announce the successful projects and the level of funding approved for each local authority shortly.</p>  <p>  Last year I also introduced a &euro;7 million Streetscape Enhancement Measure under the Scheme to help improve the visual appearance of over 120 towns and villages the length and breadth of the country. I also allocated funding for investment in digital hubs as part of a Connected Hubs Fund.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to secure increased funding across the range of rural development schemes in Budget 2022, and my officials are currently working on the follow up Town and Village Renewal Scheme for 2022.

The Libraries Capital Programme has eight completed projects and five more are under construction. &euro;3 million was provided by my Department under a Small Scale Capital Works programme which supported local authorities in carrying out refurbishment works in library branches to respond to public health guidance and upgrade facilities. Funding is also being provided to support the continued expansion of the transformative My Open Library Service, which enables members to access the library 8am - 10pm, 365 days a year.</p>  <p>  In 2022, funding of &euro;7.7 million is being provided for public library infrastructure and services, with a focus on fit-for-purpose buildings, and supports for marginalised, socially excluded and disadvantaged communities, in line with the actions under the public library strategy 'Our Public Libraries 2022 - Inspiring, Connecting, and Empowering Communities'.</p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department approved funding of &euro;6 million for the upgrade of ICT capacity and facilities in public libraries. This was the first step in establishing the library as an important enabler of digital services.  In 2020 almost &euro;700,000 was approved to support the provision of sensory facilities and equipment in libraries and in 2021 &euro;850,000 was approved for the provision of library supports for marginalised, socially excluded and disadvantaged communities. </p>  <p>  'Our Public Libraries 2022' seeks to establish the library as an important enabler of digital services and facilitator of digital skills development. In addition to its 330 library branch network, the public library service provides an array of online and digital services. During 2020 my Department invested some &euro;400,000 in the excellent online library service which has soared in levels of membership and usage since the beginning of the pandemic. The service provides access to more than 57,000 eBooks and 43,000 eAudiobooks, 4,000 magazines, 2,400 online newspapers from over 100 countries, more than 500 e-learning courses and 100 online language courses. </p>  <p>  Libraries are innovating, adapting and evolving and my Department will continue to support and enable their development taking account of technological and service innovations. A new Public Library Strategy 2023-2027 will be developed by my Department in association with the CCMA which will provide the framework for an inclusive, modern, sustainable and high quality public library service in Ireland.</p></reply>
