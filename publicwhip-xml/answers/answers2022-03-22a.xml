Translation Services </b></p><p>Details of annual expenditure on services is set out in the table below:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Year </div></th>       <th><div>2021 </div></th>       <th><div>2022 </div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>Translation &amp;amp;

This is reflected in Question 2 on the census form which asks &ldquo;What is your sex?&rdquo; with response options of &ldquo;Male&rdquo; and &ldquo;Female&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  CSO launched a public consultation on the content of the Census 2022 questionnaire in late 2017. As part of this consultation, members of the public and interested stakeholders were invited to submit their requests for new questions and revisions to existing questions.  To assist the CSO in assessing the submissions, a Census Advisory Group (CAG) was formed. Membership of the CAG was drawn from organisations and groups who regularly use census data. The CAG made recommendations on which new and revised questions should be tested during a Census Pilot survey which was held in September 2018. Following the Pilot, the CAG assisted the CSO in deciding which questions should be recommended to government for inclusion on the census form.</p>  <p>  During the consultation process, several submissions were made requesting a new question on gender identity. As gender identity is an emerging area for statistical data collection, the CAG proposed that the CSO should test and develop a new question that would capture robust data on gender identity before it should be considered for inclusion on a census. Subsequent to the consultation, the CSO has introduced a new gender identity question on both a household survey and as part of the new PULSE surveys.  The CSO&rsquo;s view is that the new question has performed well and that it will be recommended for Pilot testing as part of the preparations for the next census. Inclusion of the new gender identity question in the next census will be subject to approval by the CAG and ultimately by government. </p>  <p>  The CSO is aware that in the absence of a question on gender identity on the census form, some members of the public may have difficulty in responding to the question on sex as it appears on the census form.  In order to make the census as inclusive as possible, the CSO has advised that for people who have such a difficulty, they can mark both male and female boxes.</p>  <p>  In order to meet the aforementioned EU regulation, the CSO is legally obliged to categorise the sex of all persons on the census as either male or female. When both response options have been marked on the census form, the CSO will be required to impute a value of either male or female to each digital record. The imputation of these values will reflect the distribution of the sex variable across the population, which is approximately 50/50. The digital data will be used as the basis for census statistical publications and will only be released in aggregated form.</p>  <p>  The CSO will not make any amendments to the paper forms returned from the public.  Thus, should someone mark both boxes in the sex question on their census form, this paper record will remain unchanged and will be what is made public 100 years after the census in line with Section 35 of the Statistics Act 1993. </p>  <p>  Census 2022 also contains a new time capsule section which provides a space on the form where households have the option to write a message of their choosing. Along with the rest of the census forms, these messages will be placed in secure storage until the release of the forms after 100 years.  The time capsules provide an opportunity for members of the public to record information not otherwise captured on the census form.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-22a.247.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032200061#WRF03100"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the European Union imposed Safeguard Measures on steel imports into the EU in July 2018 in response to the United States applying a 25% tariff on steel imports originating from 3rd Countries, including the European Union. As a result of the US Measures, there was an increased risk of steel originally destined for the US market being diverted to the EU and thereby distorting the EU steel market. </p>  <p>  To address this risk, the EU introduced Steel Safeguards Measures in 2018 for an initial period of 3 years. These measures were extended following a review of the mechanism in June 2021. The decision to continue the measures for a minimum period of 2 years was based on a Commission-led review which recommended the prolongation of the measures in order to defend the Single Market against 3rd country steel flooding the market, which could potentially injure EU steel producers across the Union.</p>  <p>  The current Safeguard Measures allow for the importation of steel from 3rd Countries by way of quotas, determined in line with traditional volumes of trade in steel before the Safeguard tariff is applied.  Thus, traditional trade flows should not be impacted by the ongoing Measures.</p>  <p>Additionally, as of the 1st   January of this year a quota-based system on exports of EU steel and aluminium into the US was implemented in place of the 2018 tariffs on all such imports. This system allows all EU Member States to export steel and aluminium products to the US - within traditional trade volumes - without attracting the additional 25% tariff. In response, the EU suspended its rebalancing countermeasures against the US that were imposed in 2018, these rebalancing measures are separate to the Steel Safeguard measures that continue to be applied to third county imports. These joint actions are welcomed but are considered to be incremental steps in finding a permanent solution to the issue of trade in steel and aluminium between the EU and US. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know on the 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation commenced a large scale military invasion of Ukraine. As one element of its response, the European Union implemented an import ban on steel products originating in the Russian Federation and Belarus and this action was taken due to the unacceptable and illegal Russian military aggression against Ukraine.</p>  <p>  In light of these developments, the EU Commission recognised that its Safeguard Measures needed to be recalibrated to take into account changed internal market dynamics due to the ban of imports of steel and aluminium products from the Russian Federation and Belarus. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the EU Commission proposed to Member States to adjust the functioning of the EU Safeguard measures to ensure that these import bans do not create a shortage of supply in the Union and that Union steel users can continue to source those volumes from other third country sources. </p>  <p>  The proposals themselves aimed to proportionately redistribute the quota volumes allocated to both countries among other exporting third countries based on the most recent data available to the EU Commission, the overall share of imports from 2021. This approach by the EU is also in line with the logic of the functioning of the measure, as it preserves traditional trade flows in terms of volumes and origins, adapted to the current exceptional circumstances.</p>  <p>This proposal has been formally adopted by the European Union and came into force as of 16th   March 2022.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to engage with Irish industry and representative groups and liaise closely with EU officials regarding the operation of the safeguard measures to ensure that they continue to meet their objective in guarding EU steel producers from the harmful impact of trade diversion of steel while at the same time ensuring that the EU market stays open to fair and sustainable competition where EU importers can secure supply at competitive prices.  </p>  <p>  As always, steel sourced within the EU is not subject to any such tariffs as part of the Single Market.</p></reply>

The Irish standard (I.S. 419:2011) and regulations (SI No. 316/1995) were introduced to protect consumers by preventing the rapid spread of a fire started on or near furniture. The Irish Regulations set out a more robust safety standard than applies in other EU Member States in order to provide a higher level of safety in this area.</p>  <p>  Due to competing priorities as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic,  progress on the assessment of submissions was delayed, however analysis of the submissions has resumed again at pace. There have been a number of reports comparing mortality rates due to fires in the EU and the United States along with reports looking at the causes of domestic fires and these reports are being taken into account by my officials, where relevant.</p>  <p>  I hope to have recommendations on any revised regulations on foot of that evaluation process in the later in the year.</p></reply>

My Department has replied to the queries raised. However, as the process is incomplete it is not appropriate for me to comment further at this time. </p>  <p>  A European Works Council (a &ldquo;EWC&rdquo;) is a body that facilitates information and consultation with European employees on transnational issues. EWC are subject to the law of the Member State in which they are located. They derive from Directive 1994/45/EC (the &ldquo;EWC Directive&rdquo;) as transposed into Irish law by the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Act 1996. A recast by Directive 2009/38/EC was given effect by European Communities (Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Act 1996) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 380 of 2011).</p>  <p>  The purpose of the recast Directive is to improve the right to information and to consultation of employees in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings. </p>  <p>  The general provisions of the Irish Regulation follow the provisions of Directive 2009/38/EC faithfully providing mechanisms for dispute resolution. There is no caselaw to support an assertion that the provisions of the Regulation are insufficient.</p>  <p>  My Department are satisfied that the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Act, 1996 as amended fully and correctly transposes Directive 2009/38/EC into national law. However, should any inadequacies be identified, they will be addressed in due course.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).</p>  <p>  The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is high international gas prices where we are a price taker.  In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have risen and remained high since the second half of 2020. Gas prices are now unprecedently high, with UK wholesale gas prices recently reaching record levels. </p>  <p>  This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.</p>  <p>  Energy security and prices were two of the issues raised by business representatives at the most recent meeting of the Enterprise Forum hosted by my Department last week, and which was attended remotely by An T&aacute;naiste, Leo Varadkar.</p>  <p>  While the Government cannot resolve all the difficulties with energy supplies, we will do all we can to mitigate the impact on businesses and households. While the hope is that the crisis can be resolved within a matter of months, there is no guarantee this will be the case. </p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said it was clear that the problems raised are broader than energy supplies alone, and that the Government are committed to engaging with the business sectors on how best to deal with these issues, and also how to maintain consumer confidence in the medium term.  A further meeting of the Enterprise Forum will take place in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Separately, the recently launched Climate Toolkit 4 Business is an important resource for SMEs and micro enterprises. With climate change, changing regulations, rising resource costs and changing customer expectations adopting an eco-friendlier approach is one way forward for business.</p>  <p>  The Climate Toolkit 4 Business promotes an understanding of the enterprises current carbon footprint, assists enterprises in their journey to become more energy efficient and signposts the energy efficiency supports available to them. The Toolkit directs users to advice, grants and other resources available from the LEOs, EI, SEAI, Irish Water, EPA, IDA and others.</p>  <p>  In March 2021, the Local Enterprise Office Green for Micro programme was launched on a pilot basis. The Local Enterprise Offices approved 269 Green for Micro projects in 2021, assisting Micro enterprises to prepare for the low carbon, more resource efficient economy of the future. This support is open to a broad range of micro enterprises, including retail, with fewer than ten employees.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Minister Eamon Ryan TD., Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, may be able to assist the Deputy further in relation to SEAI Business Grants.</p></reply>

I fully appreciate how difficult the situation is for those involved and for their families.</p>  <p>  The Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies. It includes an obligation to engage in a 30-day information and consultation process with employees&rsquo; representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies. Where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of the Act, they may pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to waive the consultation period. The employer &ndash; or a receiver or liquidator appointed to the employer &ndash; has a statutory obligation under sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 to consult with employees. There are no provisions allowing for waiving of the consultation period set out in law.</p>  <p>  Following engagement with my Department, the receiver confirmed to employees there is no statutory restriction on employees taking up additional employment during a statutory redundancy consultation period, in circumstances where they are not expected to attend the workplace. Provided they do not resign from their current employment, there should be no obstacle to retaining their statutory redundancy entitlements.</p>  <p>  I assure you Government will work in a coordinated way to assist the workers of Roadbridge Ltd. The Department of Social Protection is currently working to provide income support for employees affected by Roadbridge&rsquo;s immediate cessation of trade and has been in contact with the receiver in this regard. </p>  <p>  Further, in situations where the employer cannot pay statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements due to insolvency, the State provides a safety net for employees to ensure they receive their statutory entitlements from the Social Insurance Fund.</p></reply>

My Department is considering the Commission's recommendations in relation to mandatory retirement ages in certain contracts of employment.</p>  <p>  There is no statutory retirement age for employees in Irish legislation, apart from for certain public sector employees where statutory retirement ages may apply. A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the parties.</p>  <p>  Employment equality must be a core consideration in reforms to address mandatory retirement clauses, and the needs of both employees and employers will require consideration and further consultation. In this regard, it will be necessary to liaise closely with employer groups as any changes in this area have potential to have a significant impact on workforce planning, particularly for SMEs.</p>  <p>  Other pension related reforms, such as the national auto-enrolment pension scheme, will be an important tool to address the issues involved.  The delivery of an auto-enrolment pension scheme will make it easier for people to access retirement savings options to help them meet their own income expectations for when they retire and is a current Programme for Government commitment.</p></reply>

The Plan is designed to address barriers to retrofit across four key areas: driving demand and activity; financing and funding; supply chain, skills and standards; and governance. In line with commitments in the Plan, the Government recently approved a package of significantly enhanced supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades.The new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme will provide increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard. A network of One Stop Shops will offer a new end-to-end project management service for homeowners. This includes surveying the home; designing the upgrades; managing the grant processes; helping with access to finance; engaging the contractors to deliver the work and then quality-assuring that work.</p><p>In addition, increased grants for attic and cavity wall insulation have also been made available, covering 80% of the cost to homeowners of these highly cost-effective upgrade measures. Free upgrades are also available for households at risk of energy poverty. My Department is also developing a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme which will enable financial institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates for retrofit projects. An equity release scheme is not being considered at this time. </p></reply>

AMETS will form part of a national suite of infrastructural facilities set up to enable offshore renewable technology development and progression towards commercial viability. It is intended that full scale marine energy devices could be tested at their final stages of pre-commercial development at AMETS.    </p>  <p>  Since the AMETS site was announced in 2010 the development of the site has progressed with work on environmental assessments for the site (onshore and offshore), applications for grid connection, planning permission for the onshore component, foreshore license and consent applications. Originally intended to test wave energy converter devices, the focus of the test-site has shifted to floating offshore wind due to slower than anticipated development of wave energy technologies. The investment to date has been &euro;6.86 million, including environmental surveys on both land and sea and grid connections. Funding in the form of an EU Interreg project called AFLOWT was secured in 2018 and that project is ongoing. The test site development is ongoing with an application for consent due to be submitted in Q1 2023 under the new Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, established in the Maritime Area Planning Act (December 2021). Onshore substation building works are also in preparation and due to commence in 2023. The aim is to bring the test site into service before the end of 2025. This ongoing development is based on stakeholder engagement and an Expression of Interest survey undertaken in 2021 by SEAI, highlight the continued interest in having a full-scale test site on the Atlantic coast. The AMETS project when operational, will facilitate testing in the unique conditions of the Atlantic (a harsh environment, high resource location), thus reducing investor risk and strengthening Ireland as a centre for Floating Offshore Wind (FOW), wave, hydrogen, and floating solar research in Europe.</p></reply>

Community enterprises including sports clubs and community halls will be eligible to participate, either as individual micro-generators or as community projects within the MSS. At present, community enterprises with existing renewable micro-generation are eligible to receive the Clean Export Guarantee tariff for all residual electricity exported to the grid. They can contact their supplier to obtain information on the Clean Export Guarantee. </p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is due to extend the domestic solar PV grant scheme to the non-domestic sector, including community enterprises, in July of this year. A Capital grant for new renewable micro-generation up to 6.0kW in size (maximum grant &euro;2,400) will be available. </p><p>  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) is currently working on the regulatory framework to facilitate renewable energy communities following a recent public consultation. The CRU has published a summary note alongside the main Conclusions Paper which specifically contains the conclusions and next steps the CRU is planning to take to implement the enabling regulatory framework for energy communities and active consumers.</p><p>  The CRU is also due to consult on an implementation plan for the Clean Export Premium (CEP) tariff in Q3 of this year.

The Plan is designed to address barriers to retrofit across four key areas: driving demand and activity; financing and funding; supply chain, skills and standards; and governance. In line with commitments in the Plan, the Government recently approved a package of significantly enhanced supports to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades.   The new National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme will provide increased grant levels of up to 50% of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard. A network of One Stop Shops will offer a new end-to-end project management service for homeowners. This includes surveying the home; designing the upgrades; managing the grant processes; helping with access to finance; engaging the contractors to deliver the work and then quality-assuring that work.</p>  <p>  Households in receipt of a State Pension, whose homes meet the eligibility criteria, can apply for support including whole home upgrade grants under the National Home Energy Upgrade scheme and individual grants for energy efficiency measures.</p>  <p>  Free upgrades available under the Warmer Homes scheme are currently available to households who are in receipt of certain Department of Social Protection payments including the Fuel Allowance.  I understand that the State Pension is a qualifying payment for the Fuel Allowance, which is a means tested payment. Households can contact the Department of Social Protection to check whether they meet the relevant means test.</p></reply>

Ervia has provided regular updates to the Steering Group, established to examine the feasibility of CCS in Ireland under the 2019 Climate Action Plan, on the study&rsquo;s progress. The latest update was in December 2021 when, as requested by the CCS steering group, Ervia submitted a report &ldquo;Assessment of the Feasibility of CCS for Deployment in Ireland&rdquo; to assess the feasibility of CCS deployment in Ireland against criteria developed by the steering group. In addition, as an EU Project of Common Interest (PCI), included on the 4th EU PCI List, project promoter, Ervia, successfully applied for &euro;1 million in EU grant funding through the EU Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) in May 2020. Using this grant funding, Ervia is carrying out a further detailed study regarding the transport of CO2 in the Cork and Dublin areas. This includes the network transport and conditioning of CO2 for storage in the Kinsale Head gas field or export via ship to CO2 storage facilities in other countries. Funding secured through the successful CEF application will cover approximately half of the study&rsquo;s anticipated &euro;2 million cost, with the study scheduled to conclude in 2022. In conjunction with this, Ervia is part of a Horizon 2020 project &ldquo;Realise&rdquo; which is developing a lower cost technology for capturing CO2 for industrial emitters. This involves testing the CO2 capture technology at Whitegate oil refinery and assessing how it could be integrated into a wider industrial carbon capture cluster.</p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 143,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme. In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was &euro;17,100.There are currently just over 7,000 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are:</p><p>- Awaiting the initial survey of their home;</p><p>- Have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor;- Have been allocated to a contractor for works; or</p><p>- Currently undergoing works.Activity under the scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID pandemic, when construction activity was paused for approximately 12 months in total, in line with Government guidelines. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2021, the average time for a surveyor to be allocated was approximately 18 months. The average cycle time from application to completion was approximately 26 months, taking into account the increase in waiting times due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions and the deeper measures being provided under the scheme since 2018.</p><p>The following key actions have already been taken:</p><p>- The budget for this year, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund;- The number of homes retrofitted under the scheme are to increase from 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month in 2022;</p><p>- SEAI has been allocated additional staff for the Warmer Homes Scheme;- Increasing contractor output through contract management.</p><p>Works under the scheme have now recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector and activity did ramp up again towards the end of last year. Based on the foregoing, SEAI target clearing the homes currently on the waiting list in approximately 18 months. This will be done by targeting those homes that are longest on the waiting list first, and then prioritising the worst performing properties, i.e. homes that were built before January 1993 and have a Building Energy Rating of E, F or G.</p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 143,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme. In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household had increased to &euro;17,100. At the end of February, there are currently just over 6,900 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are: Awaiting the initial survey of their home; Have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor; Have been allocated to a contractor for works; or, Currently undergoing works. </p><p>Activity under the Scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID pandemic. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed so far in 2022, the average cycle time from application to completion was approximately 27 months. While this delay was largely driven by COVID related issues, the deeper measures being provided under the scheme since 2018, also involve more substantive works. In order to reduce this timeline to completion, the following key actions are being taken:</p><p>- The budget this year, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund;</p><p>- The number of homes retrofitted under the scheme are due to increase from 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month in 2022;- SEAI has allocated additional staff for the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme;- SEAI is working to increase contractor output through active contract engagement and management.</p><p>Works under the Scheme recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector and activity did ramp up again towards the end of last year. Based on the foregoing, SEAI target clearing the homes currently on the waiting list in approximately 18 months.</p></reply>

In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have risen and remained high since the second half of 2020. Gas prices are now unprecedentedly high, with UK wholesale gas prices recently reaching record levels. This is a global phenomenon and expert bodies, including the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the European Commission, have attributed this to a range of demand, supply and geopolitical events, particularly the invasion of Ukraine by Russia that has significantly exacerbated the tightening of the European gas market supplies and the consequent upward trend in wholesale gas prices we have witnessed since mid 2020. This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlate strongly with the price of gas. This is an issue across all EU member states. </p><p>  The position of successive Governments, has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices. The best long-term approach to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy, the expansion of interconnection with our European and neighbouring markets and to deepen internal electricity market integration. Cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term. This is what Government is working toward.</p><p>  In relation to energy efficiency the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) administers a number of schemes funded by my Department including the Communities Energy Grant (CEG) Scheme that may be particularly relevant in this instance. The Communities Energy Grant Scheme supports new approaches to achieving high quality improvements in energy efficiency. By bringing together groups of buildings under the same retrofit programme, these projects facilitate community-wide energy improvements more efficiently and cost effectively than might otherwise be possible. A new call for CEG projects for 2022 will issue from the SEAI shortly. More information on the Community Energy Grant Scheme, including details of Project Co-ordinators, is available on the SEAI website or SEAI may be contacted directly on 1850 927 000 or by e-mail at bec@seai.ie. </p></reply>

Delivery of its objectives will be instrumental in meeting the challenges identified in the Ireland 2040 project, with a key focus on minimising waste generation and extending the productive life of the materials we use.  Some measures have been delivered already, such as the inclusion of soft plastics in the household recycling bin. A large number of transformational measures, such as the introduction of a Deposit and Return Scheme, are well-advanced and others will be introduced through the forthcoming Circular Economy Bill, such as provisions to improve segregation of waste in the commercial sector, and a national food waste prevention roadmap.</p><p>Local Authorities are statutorily responsible for the preparation of Waste Management plans.  Regional Waste Management Planning Offices are currently preparing a new National Waste Management Plan, informed by, inter alia, the National Planning Framework. The plan will set out the required actions at local and regional levels to deliver on the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy (WAPCE) and support Ireland's circular economy transition.</p><p>The new National Plan will contain targets for reuse, repair, resource consumption and recycling through measures such as:</p><p>- the introduction of a Deposit and Return Scheme;</p><p>- the application of incentivised pricing to commercial waste;</p><p>- the enhanced use of civic amenity sites as circular economy hubs;</p><p>- supporting the development of indigenous treatment capacity to reduce reliance on export.</p><p>The National Waste Management Plan will be published in 2022.</p></reply>

Excise duty is being reduced by 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent per litre of diesel.  These reductions are in place until 31 August 2022 and should help to reduce the operating costs of non-electric SPSVs.</p>  <p>  Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles, I announced on February 4th last, the re-opening of the eSPSV Grant Scheme with a further &euro;15 million allocated to it for 2022.  The take-up rate for this Scheme was exceptionally high in 2021: almost 600 drivers successfully applied for grants, with over &euro;11 million paid out as well as &euro;4 million in provisional grant offers.  The operation of the Scheme is a matter for the NTA and details of the Scheme are available on the NTA&rsquo;s website. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030.</p>  <p>  The grant schemes are kept under continuous review to ensure that they are as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort.</p>  <p>  The Low Emission Vehicle Toll Incentive (LEVTI) Scheme which offers toll discounts for alternatively fuelled vehicles was introduced in July 2018 and is expected to run until December 31st, 2022 (available only to a maximum of 50,000 LEVs). BEV and PHEVs qualify for 50% and 25% toll reductions respectively up to a maximum &euro;500 annual threshold for private vehicles and a maximum annual threshold of &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles (greater off-peak rates also apply to the M50 toll). The Scheme was expanded in 2020 to include toll reductions for electric motorbikes, hydrogen fuelled passenger cars and SPSVs, and heavy duty vehicles (trucks, buses and coaches) fuelled by compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), hydrogen or electricity.</p>  <p>  As part of preparations for Budget 2023, I have asked Departmental officials to review the full range Exchequer supports currently provided to EV owners, including the LEVTI scheme.</p></reply>

This includes polices that promote the rights and inclusion of groups across the equality grounds. Some strategies include specified targets; for example, an increase from 3% to 6% of people with disabilities in the workforce by 2024 (Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities) and 1% of the workforce to comprise ethnic minorities (Migrant Integration Strategy, National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021).</p>  <p>  The Public Appointments Service (PAS) as recruiters of staff for the public service play a central role in recruiting diverse talent to take up public service employment opportunities, as outlined in their Equality, Diversity and Inclusion strategy which includes access and the effect of recruitment and selection processes to attract candidates from diverse backgrounds, including the Traveller Community.</p>  <p>  In relation to travel costs, the Deputy will be aware that a new suite of measures is being introduced by Government to help with the rising cost of living, including a 20% average fare reduction on PSO public transport services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO services every day. &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares; this funding does not include an extension of the scheme to private coach and bus operators. As the Deputy will be aware, unlike with PSO services, the National Transport Authority (NTA) do not set, monitor or regulate fares on services run by commercial operators.</p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.</p>  <p>  These measures align with our objectives of decarbonisation, decongesting cities, improving liveability, and providing accessibility on an equitable basis which will have a real impact in people&rsquo;s pockets.</p></reply>

It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future. The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. </p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a requirement that new buildings and those undergoing substantial renovation works will have to include charging points for electric vehicles if they have more than 10 car parking spaces. </p>  <p>  As regards existing apartment buildings, work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the public electric vehicle charging network over the coming years. A national charging infrastructure strategy is due to be published for public consultation in the coming month which will set out a pathway for infrastructure provision ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030. This strategy will specifically address the challenge for citizens without access to a driveway, and plans for EV charging infrastructure provision for people in this category. </p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the primary focus of the Public Charge Point Scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. The scheme continues to be available to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort and an updated scheme is likely to be launched shortly after publication of the EV Infrastructure Strategy</p></reply>

It was necessary to prioritise projects for funding in a manner which seeks to achieve key outcomes in line with the NDP. Resulting from this, while a large majority of the projects under the NDP were issued a funding allocation in 2022, TII were unable to provide an allocation for the N2 Clontibret to the Border project. The delivery programme for this project will be kept under review for next year and considered in terms of the overall funding envelope available to TII.</p><p>In this context, TII is best placed to advise on the latest status of this proposed project.  I have referred your question, on this occasion, to TII for a direct reply in this regard.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

The causes of these price pressures are not within our control. This is being witnessed across the European Union as well as many other regions.</p>  <p>  Minister Ryan and I have been closely engaged with the haulage sector since last December, exploring options that might address cost burdens while at the same time tackling the decarbonisation challenge for heavy goods vehicles. </p>  <p>  The recent crisis in Ukraine has had a further dramatic impact on fuel prices.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with the sector, on 11 March 2022, my Department announced an emergency support measure for licensed hauliers to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices. This targeted, temporary grant scheme will provide a fixed payment of &euro;100 per week for each heavy goods vehicle (over 3.5 tonnes) as listed on a road haulage operator&rsquo;s licence. The scheme will operate for a period of 8 weeks and will be reviewed thereafter. The estimated cost to the State for the temporary measure is &euro;18 million. Details on how to avail of the Scheme will be communicated to hauliers.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Scheme, you will also be aware that the Government on 9 March 2022 reduced Excise duty by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil in order to reduce the cost of fuels. </p>  <p>  Further, the Diesel Rebate Scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators when the price of diesel is high. In Budget 2020, in light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry, the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.32 (VAT inclusive) was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre. In recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, this increase has been maintained since.</p>  <p>  In addition, businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs, such as road diesel and other motoring costs.</p>  <p>  There are also supports available for operators to switch to alternatively fuelled vehicles. These include a purchase grant and reduced tolls for vehicles powered by a number of alternative fuels including hydrogen, electric, and gas. In addition, Budget 2022 announced an expansion of the Accelerated Capital Allowance (&lsquo;ACA&rsquo;) scheme for Gas Vehicles and Refuelling Equipment. This ACA scheme provides an accelerated wear and tear allowance for capital expenditure incurred on qualifying vehicles and refuelling equipment.</p>  <p>  The past two years have presented many challenges for the sector - the measures I have outlined above reflect Government understanding of that pressure and recognition of the important role that the haulage industry plays in keeping the country going.  Minister Ryan and I will continue to monitor this issue as it evolves. </p></reply>

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU has adopted measures to address the impact the introduction of travel and public health restrictions has had on the ability of airlines to maintain their historic slots at congested airports throughout Europe. This has enabled airlines to retain the airport slots they historically held even during a period of decreased demand for air services.</p>  <p>  The alleviation measures applied have been gradually  reduced as European aviation has recovered from the impacts of COVID.  The  purpose of the  alleviation measures was intended to reduce the commerical risks to airlines of not utilising slots where trafic had fallen away.  Any airline operating empty flights solely to retain control of certain airport slots is a cause for concern particularly from a climate impact perspective.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the European Commission is monitoring the situation and may make proposals for continuing alleviation measures should evidence suggest that it is necessary.</p></reply>

These standards are explained in the SPSV Initial Suitability Inspection Manual (available at ).</p><p>Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles, I announced on February 4th last, the re-opening of the eSPSV Grant Scheme, with a further &euro;15 million allocated to it for 2022. The grants will enable owners of taxis and hackneys, to buy electric vehicles (EVs).</p><p>Administered by the NTA, SPSV drivers can apply for grants of up to &euro;10,000 towards the purchase of a new, full-battery eSPSV, with a further &euro;2,500 available to convert it to a wheelchair-accessible model.  Taxi drivers are eligible for double the normal grant when they scrap an older, more polluting or high mileage vehicle and make the switch to electric. By scrapping and switching, up to &euro;20,000 can be available for a new, fully electric SPSV and if the taxi is a wheelchair-accessible electric vehicle, the supports rise to &euro;25,000.  A driver can apply to combine both the eSPSV grant scheme and the WAV grant scheme up to a maximum of &euro;32,500.</p><p>The take-up rate for this Scheme was exceptionally high in 2021: almost 600 drivers successfully applied for grants, with over &euro;11 million paid out as well as &euro;4 million in provisional grant offers.  The operation of the Scheme is a matter for the NTA and details of the Scheme are available on the NTA's website.</p><p>Considering the NTA's responsibility in these matters, I have forwarded the Deputies questions to the Authority for consideration and direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within 10 working days.</p></reply>

The types of measures developed included widening of footpaths to accommodate social distancing, developing temporary cycling facilities, enhancing pedestrian movement including additional pedestrianisation, alterations to bus stops/routes, plus the introduction of lower speed limits. Most of these interventions were implemented through temporary construction involving bollards, pencil cones, plastic barriers, road markings and signage.</p>  <p>  The two main legislative provisions to enable the implementation of the above types of measures are:  Section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (as amended by Section 37 of the Road Traffic Act 1994) and Section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1994.</p>  <p>  The Government has committed to a significant step-change in investment for Active Travel with &euro;360m per annum to be invested in walking and cycling infrastructure in all parts of the country. It is to be expected, therefore, that there will be an increase in planning applications of all types, be that Part VIII or Section 38 or applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la due to the increased number of projects that this funding will support.</p>  <p>  I do not have any data on whether or not Section 38 has been used more frequently in recent years. However, we have seen some fantastic examples of local authorities using it to great effect to make improvements to the public realm in towns and villages by re-orientating streets toward the pedestrian, the cyclist and public transport. Dublin City Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, to name just two, have demonstrated how infrastructure can be delivered quickly, safely and appropriately, using this legislative provision.</p>  <p>  We do not tend to hear about the many uncontroversial projects that are progressed using Section 38 which I consider to be a very useful piece of legislation. We should not shy away from utilising the expertise of our town planners and engineers to progress projects that benefit society and help to reduce our emissions by improving the accessibility of our towns and villages for people walking and cycling.</p></reply>

In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on Public Service Obligation (PSO) transport services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO services every day. &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares; this funding does not include an extension of the scheme to private coach and bus operators. As the Deputy will be aware, unlike with PSO services, the National Transport Authority (NTA) do not set, monitor or regulate fares on services run by commercial operators.</p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.</p>  <p>  Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system particularly in areas which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services. In recognition of this, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic the Government have provided temporary financial supports for certain licensed commercial services with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.</p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months in June 2020, however owing to the continued fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue, the support has been extended a number of times.

Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the planning, design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. This is also subject to the Public Spending Code and the necessary statutory approvals.</p>  <p>  The N20 road corridor options are currently being progressed by TII with rail-based alternatives as comparators. These options include a new motorway, the M20, or the upgrading of various sections along the existing N20. The two rail scenarios being considered include the existing Cork to Limerick rail line and a new rail line from Charleville to Limerick. The road options largely follow the existing N20 corridor.</p>  <p>  An online public consultation on the possible route options, carried out by the N/M20 Project Team, had unprecedented public engagement with the closing date for submissions extended by four weeks from the 18 December 2020 to the 15 January 2021. In order to take into account possible changes to appraisal requirements, the assessment work on options continues, with a preferred route to be selected by Quarter 2 of this year and public consultation to follow.</p>  <p>  Subsequent to this, work on scheme design and environmental evaluation will be undertaken, in addition to the scheme Business Case, which is required under the Public Spending Code. The scheme Business Case is expected to be submitted to my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in early 2023. Subject to its approval, the submission of statutory documents for the project to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will follow thereafter. TII has allocated &euro;6 million to the scheme for 2022.</p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred your question to TII for a direct reply as to the latest status of this project. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

The price of fuel on the forecourt is set by the individual retailer and would likely take into account the costs associated with the retail of the product such as those mentioned above together with the cost of having oil delivered. </p>  <p>  Garages are not committing an offence simply by charging a higher price than competitors. However, all garages must operate within the bounds of consumer protection and competition law in relation to their pricing policies and practices. I have no function in this area. </p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory independent body responsible for the promotion of consumer rights and the enforcement of consumer law. The CCPC provides information on consumer rights and enforces consumer protection laws, including rules on pricing and deceptive trading practices.    </p>  <p>  If an individual believes that a breach of their consumer rights has occurred, they may make a complaint directly to the business concerned, but also to the CCPC.  The CPCC provides advice and guidelines on the process of making a complaint. Full information is available at: www.ccpc.ie.</p></reply>

The scheme will operate for a period of 8 weeks and will be reviewed thereafter. </p>  <p>  This measure comes in addition to the VAT inclusive reduction of 15 cent per litre of diesel and 20 cent per litre of petrol which came into effect on 10 March and will apply until 31 August 2022.  </p>  <p>  Qualifying road haulage operators may also apply for relief under the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS) which was introduced in 2013 with the aim of providing support to road haulage and bus transport operators when the retail price of auto diesel is relatively high. The DRS is provided for in section 99A of Finance Act 1999 and operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby a partial rebate of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT) is available when the retail price of a litre of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 excluding VAT. The repayment rate increases gradually as the retail price increases up to a maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre.  In Budget 2020, the marginal rate of repayment was increased from 30% to 60% at prices over &euro;1.07 excluding VAT. The rate of repayment is currently capped at 7.5 cents per litre which is reached when the average price of diesel, excluding VAT, is &euro;1.16 or more per litre.</p>  <p>  The Energy Tax Directive sets minimum rates for the taxation of auto fuels. The combination of the temporary excise reduction and the Diesel Rebate Scheme mean it is not possible to reduce the rate of MOT on diesel any further.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, VAT registered businesses are also eligible to claim a refund on the VAT paid for diesel used in the course of business activities. </p>  <p>  The Government is very aware of the impact of increased fuel prices on business and society alike and for this reason, we have taken the decision to provide additional financial support by reducing the excise rate temporarily and providing a grant scheme to licenced hauliers.   The combined cost of these measures is over &euro;300 million euro.   </p>  <p>  The temporary excise reduction, grant scheme, DRS and VAT refund scheme all provide support to road haulage operators as well as businesses dependent on transport services and will help to lessen the impact of the current inflationary trend in fuel prices.</p></reply>

Although the State is a shareholder in some of the banks operating in the State, they must be run on a commercial and independent basis. Actions taken by the banks, including the services they choose to provide, are matters for the board and management of each institution.</p>  <p>  While decisions regarding the number of bank counters in branches is a commercial decision for each regulated entity, the Central Bank and I expect that all regulated firms will take a consumer-focused approach and act in their customers&rsquo; best interests, particularly in dealings with vulnerable consumers. People who may be experiencing particular vulnerabilities must be provided with whatever reasonable arrangements and/or assistance they need in their dealings with regulated entities. </p>  <p>  On 25 June 2021, the Central Bank issued an industry letter regarding its consumer protection expectations in the changing retail banking landscape. In respect of vulnerable customers, this industry letter sets out that all customers are potentially vulnerable to the risk of making uninformed decisions, or decisions that are not in their best interests, particularly during times of uncertainty and change. The Central Bank sets out the following expectation of regulated entities in respect of vulnerable customers:</p>  <p>  Consider specifically the impact of their decisions on vulnerable customers and provide the assistance necessary to reasonably mitigate those impacts and retain access to basic financial services.</p>  <p>  Have specific and effective processes and communication plans to support vulnerable customers during a time of increased uncertainty.  </p>  <p>  More generally my Department engages regularly with the banking sector on a wide variety of relevant issues including consumer related matters. </p>  <p>  My Department is also currently undertaking a review of the retail banking sector. This Retail Banking Review has commenced its work and is currently in its research phase. As part of the Review, a survey of consumers is currently underway  to ascertain their experience and perceptions of the retail banking sector in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In addition, there will also be a public consultation process this year where members of the public can make a submission to the Department of Finance on issues that fall within the Terms of Reference.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the 2020 Programme for Government committed to increasing the amount that is charged per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from fuels to &euro;100 by 2030. I followed through on this commitment by introducing legislation in Finance Act 2020 to provide for a 10-year trajectory for carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of CO<sub>2 </sub>by 2030. This measure is a key pillar underpinning the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. </p><p>It is important to note that a significant portion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy efficiency measures, which not only support the most vulnerable households in society but also in the long term, provide support against fuel price impacts by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. </p><p>The Government recognises the impacts of the current fuel price increases. These trends are driven primarily by global factors and it is not possible for the Government to fully insulate consumers against these price impacts.  </p><p>However,  I took the decision to alleviate some of these impacts through the domestic taxation of fuel with a temporary reduction in the excise rate for auto fuels and Marked Gas Oil.Effective from 10 March 2022 there is a reduction of 20 cent in the excise rates for petrol, 15 cent on auto diesel, and a 2 cent reduction for the excise on Marked Gas Oil (green diesel).  These measures are VAT inclusive and will last until 31 August 2022.</p><p>This excise reduction comes in addition to the package of measures announced by Government in February 2022 which includes:</p><p>-  an increase in the energy credit to &euro;200 including VAT, estimated to impact just over 2 million households</p><p>-  a lump sum payment of &euro;125 on the fuel allowance will be paid to 390,000 recipients</p><p>-  there will be a temporary reduction in public transport fares of 20% from the end of April to the end of the year. This will impact approximately 800,000 daily users of Bus &Eacute;ireann, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, Go Ahead, Luas, DART and Local Link services. </p><p>-  a reduction of the Drug Payment Scheme from &euro;144 to &euro;80. This will benefit just over 70,000 families</p><p>-  the working family payment budget increase will be brought forward from 1 June to 1 April and</p><p>-  reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children.</p><p>In designing a support package, the Government was conscious of the increase in energy costs but the need to target these supports. This suite of measures strikes the appropriate balance and provides support to every domestic electricity account via the electricity credit, but also provides specific supports for more vulnerable households through targeted welfare measures.</p></reply>

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended). Finance Act 1999 provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils, such as petrol, diesel, and kerosene, that are used as motor or heating fuels.</p><p>MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. In complying with ETD minimum rates, total MOT rates are taken into account. To clarify the position in relation to PQs 13696/22 and 13697/22 answered on 10th March, there was an incorrect reference to MOT in relation to kerosene. This should have read as the non-carbon component of MOT. While the non-carbon component is zero, there is a carbon component of MOT on kerosene, currently set at &euro;84.84 per 1000 litres.</p><p>Under the ETD, the minimum rate of taxation on kerosene used for heating purposes is set at zero. While kerosene is the predominant oil used for heating, gas oil (diesel) is also used. Where gas oil is used for heating the ETD minimum tax rate is &euro;21.00 per 1,000 litres. Kerosene used for heating purposes is marked red, and gas oil is marked green and is usually referred to as Marked Gas Oil (MGO) or green diesel. </p><p>The non-carbon component of MOT on heating kerosene is zero so the total applicable MOT comprises the carbon component (carbon tax) only. MGO attracts both components of MOT. On 1 May 2022, the basis of carbon tax applied to non-propellant fuels will increase from &euro;33.50 to &euro;41.00 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions. Current MOT rates, and those applying from 1 May 2022, are given in the table below in euros per 1,000 litres. The breakdown rates for carbon and non-carbon components are also given, along with ETD minima. </p><p><b>MOT rate from 10 March 2022  </b><b>MOT rate from 1 May 2022</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Heating Fuel</th>       <th>ETD Minima</th>       <th>Carbon </th>       <th>Non-Carbon</th>       <th>Total<br /><br />MOT</th>       <th>Heating Fuel</th>       <th>Carbon</th>       <th>Non-Carbon</th>       <th>Total<br /><br />MOT </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerosene</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>84.84</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>84.84</td>       <td>Kerosene</td>       <td>103.83</td>       <td>0.00</td>       <td>103.83</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MGO</td>       <td>21.00</td>       <td>90.81</td>       <td>29.74</td>       <td>120.55</td>       <td>MGO</td>       <td>111.14</td>       <td>27.03</td>       <td>138.17</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>When introducing MOT rate cuts earlier this month I ensured that the overall rate on MGO will, from 1 May 2022, be set at the 2021 level of &euro;138.17 per 1,000 litres instead of the rate of &euro;158.50 per 1,000 litres legislated for in Finance Act 2020. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the cost of reducing MOT on heating kerosene to zero cents per litre for periods of one month, three months, six months, until the end of 2022 and for one year are estimated at the amounts set out in the table below.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Period</th>       <th>Cost &euro;m</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 month</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 months</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 months</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>To end 2022</td>       <td>74</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 year</td>       <td>114</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am further advised by Revenue that these estimates are based on levels of consumption in 2021, projected forward based on growth rates as anticipated by my Department in Budget 2022. Therefore, they may not fully reflect the current levels of uncertainty in the market for fuels. </p><p>MOT receipts, including both carbon and non-carbon components, for home heating oil (kerosene) for the years 2017 to 2020 are published on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/excise/net-receipts-by-commodity.pdf.</p><p>Current MOT rates for all mineral oils and vehicle gas are published on the Excise Duty rates page on Revenue&rsquo;s website.

A statistical release on the direct financial links to Russia by economic sector, issued on 4th March and incorporating the latest available data on financial services sectors, stated that, at end-2021, Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) had holdings of &euro;37.1 billion of Russian-issued assets. There were 33 Russian sponsored SPEs identified with total assets of &euro;35.5 billion, accounting for 8% of the non-securitisation SPE sector. Russian-issued assets held by regulated investment funds represented 0.3% of total assets held by regulated investment funds (or &euro;11.5 billion in total). The exposure of on and off balance sheet financial assets and liabilities to Russian counterparties held by Irish authorised banks represented 0.1% of total (or &euro;1.7 billion in total).  Russian-issued securities held by Insurance companies represented 0.1% of the sector's total assets (or &euro;97 million in total).</p>  <p>  Section 110 is intended to create a tax neutral regime for bona-fide securitisation and structured finance purposes.  Securitisation involves the creation of tradeable securities out of an income stream or projected future income stream generated by financial assets.  Securitisation allows banks to raise capital and to share risk, thereby supporting their lending to individual and business borrowers. In addition, by providing a repackaging and resale market for corporate debt, it lowers the cost of debt financing for businesses.  Such financing is useful for the productive economy as it can underpin the supply of finance to industries and companies in Ireland, Europe and further afield.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is not unique in having a specific regime for securitisations. The importance of securitisation has been recognised by the European Commission through their work on the Capital Markets Union.  A main objective of the Capital Markets Union is to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the European Union.  </p>  <p>  In terms of property, Section 22 of the Finance Act 2016 made an amendment to address concerns that some section 110 companies were being used to minimise the Irish tax exposure on Irish property transactions.  The core effect of the amendment was to remove the possibility for section 110 companies to use what are known as 'profit participating notes' to sweep Irish property or distressed debt profits out of the company in a way that ensures little or no Irish tax liability arises.</p>  <p>  As illustrated by these amendments, my officials monitor the regime on an ongoing basis and, where issues of concern have been identified, I have taken steps to address them and will continue to do so in future where necessary.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s support for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering. </p>  <p>  We have been working closely with our EU partners and fellow Member States in the adoption of sanctions in response to Russia&rsquo;s violation of Ukraine&rsquo;s territorial integrity and all aspects of the EU sanctions packages agreed to date, including those related to the financial sector, have been implemented immediately.</p>  <p>  Sanctions will not be cost-free for the EU and Ireland, but Russia&rsquo;s behaviour leaves no alternative. Entities in the Financial Services Sector in Ireland, including section 110 special purpose entities, are within scope of the sanction measures agreed unanimously by the 27 EU Member States. The sanctions apply in respect of the provision of funds either directly or indirectly to sanctioned persons, as set out in Council Regulation (EU) No 269/2014.</p>  <p>  Central Bank data shows that the direct exposures of the Irish Financial System as a whole to Russia are very small.

The Fund achieves this by targeting financing gaps in the marketplace which are an impediment to supply, and by crowding in third party capital. Furthermore, ISIF seeks to embed resilient sources of capital in the market to help ensure a robust funding environment to support Irish homebuilding through the cycle.</p>  <p>  In total ISIF has committed over &euro;950m to housing related investments. These investments have supported over &euro;3.3bn of homebuilding activity, which cumulatively are expected to deliver over 15,000 new homes by 2025.</p>  <p>  ISIF has directly supported platforms in the areas of development finance for homebuilding, on-site infrastructure finance and build to rent.  These investments have contributed significantly to increasing the availability and robustness of funding for Irish homebuilding.</p>  <p>  In 2016 ISIF funded the establishment of Activate Capital, a new lender in the Irish market focused on the provision of construction finance to Irish homebuilders at a time when this market was highly constrained.  Reflecting the success of this investment and an on-going need in the market, in 2020, ISIF rolled over its initial investment in Activate to enable it to continue to support homebuilding nationwide.  Activate reports that since inception it has funded construction on 62 sites, predominantly focused on mass market homes. All sites funded to date have the capacity to deliver 15,000 new homes.  </p>  <p>  ISIF has also invested to support the development of new homes by small and mid-sized developers nationally through Pearl Residential Equity Fund which is targeting the delivery of 2,000 new homes.   </p>  <p>  ISIF has been active in the provision of infrastructure funding which can unlock landbanks and accelerate the delivery of new homes.  In Cherrywood Co. Dublin, ISIF invested in the up-front provision of infrastructure such as roads, water, parks to unlock the site which is now in production and will result in the construction of over 4,000 new homes.  ISIF has now supported the roll out of this model more broadly, through a platform called Housing Infrastructure Services Company (&ldquo;HISCo&rdquo;). </p>  <p>  In the period 2017-2019, ISIF sought to support new apartment construction and rental supply at a time when supply was constrained.  The largest commitment in this segment was &euro;140m made to Irish Life Residential Fund, an evergreen fund focused on forward purchasing and forward funding of new apartments for rent. This means that ISIF&rsquo;s investment in this segment is entirely focused on new construction.  </p>  <p>  In total, this segment represents c.25% of ISIF&rsquo;s total investment in Irish homebuilding and has stimulated the development of over 2,800 new homes for rent in the greater Dublin area through investments with Irish Life, Avestus, Niche and Urbeo.  More recently, in 2021 ISIF invested &euro;25m with Harrison Street with the objective of supporting the development of new Purpose-Built Student Accommodation in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund in 2020/2021 resulted in a reduction of investment in new homebuilding opportunities.  However, ISIF has a strong pipeline of new opportunities in this area and continues to be focused on investing in opportunities which provide risk capital and infrastructure solutions to Irish homebuilders.</p></reply>

This is because the equity support is not a loan, a second mortgage, or any form of 'State debt', so it cannot take precedence over the debt on the property.</p></reply>

The IFI community has reacted quickly to provide vital financial support for Ukraine. On 9 March, the Executive Board of the IMF approved a disbursement of US$1.4 billion under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to help Ukraine meet urgent financing needs and mitigate the economic impact of the war. This follows a US$723 million package of support approved by the World Bank; a &euro;668 million immediate financial support package for Ukraine to be provided by the EIB; and a &euro;2 billion &lsquo;resilience package&rsquo; approved by the EBRD.</p>  <p>  In the absence of full funding by bilateral donors, debt cancellation or debt forgiveness by the IMF risks impairing the Fund's financial integrity which, in turn, could jeopardise future financing for Ukraine and other countries in need. Instead, the IMF&rsquo;s ability to provide debt service relief on its loans to members must be underpinned by donor grants for the repayment of those loans.  For example, during the COVID-19 crisis, the IMF used the donor-supported Catastrophe and Containment Relief Trust to provide debt relief totalling almost US$1 billion to cover debt obligations owed to the Fund between April 2020 and April 2022.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can assure the Deputy that my Department has very clearly articulated the Irish Government position in relation to what is happening in Ukraine.

Gambling regulation is currently provided for principally by the Betting Act 1931 (as amended) and the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 (as amended). </p><p>Gaming is defined by section 2 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 as playing a game (whether of skill or chance or partly of skill and partly of chance) for stakes hazarded by the players. This contrasts with betting where a bet is placed on the outcome of a competition, sporting activity or some other unpredictable future event.</p><p>Gaming, including eGaming and the playing of gaming machines and amusement machines, is subject to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that traders are not required to separately identify the yield generated from a particular activity or product type on their VAT return. Therefore, it is not possible to provide data on the amount of VAT specifically collected from gaming as the Deputy has requested. </p><p>Betting activities are exempt from VAT in accordance with Article 135(1)(i) of VAT Directive 2006/112/EC. However, in Ireland betting activity is subject to other taxes.  Sections 67 and 67A of the Finance Act 2002 provide for Betting Duty at a rate of 2%, in respect of every bet entered into by bookmakers with persons in the State including bets entered into by remote means. In addition, section 67B of the Finance Act 2002 provides that remote betting intermediaries are liable to Betting Intermediary Duty, at the rate of 25%, on commission charges. The total Betting Duty and Betting Intermediary Duty receipts in the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 are as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th><br /><br />Year</th>       <th>Retail Betting <br /><br />&euro; </th>       <th>Online Betting<br /><br />&euro;  </th>       <th>Betting Intermediary<br /><br />&euro;</th>       <th>Total <br /><br />&euro; </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>51,889,431 </td>       <td>40,622,117 </td>       <td>2,501,108 </td>       <td>95,012,656 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>39,021,093 </td>       <td>44,935,012 </td>       <td>2,815,335 </td>       <td>86,771,440 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>25,280,000 </td>       <td>59,710,000 </td>       <td>4,140,000 </td>       <td>89,130,000 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>There are also specific licensing requirements for betting and gaming activities. All bookmakers, remote bookmakers, and remote betting intermediaries are required to hold a valid excise licence. Similarly, where the playing of gaming and amusement machines takes place, the premises must have a valid gaming licence, or an amusement permit and all machines located in those premises must be appropriately licensed as gaming or amusement machines. Currently there are no licensing requirements for eGaming. Registers of all licences issued are published on Revenue&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019 was introduced as an interim measure pending the comprehensive reform of gambling in Ireland. The Government is committed to the modernisation of our licensing and regulatory environment for gambling. In this regard, I am aware that in line with the Programme for Government commitment work is ongoing in Department of Justice to comprehensively reform the regulation of gambling activities and to provide for an independent Gambling Regulator. The Gambling Regulator will be responsible for enforcing appropriate licensing and regulatory measures in respect of all gambling activities, including online.</p></reply>

Although the State is a shareholder in some of the banks operating in the State, they must be run on a commercial and independent basis.</p>  <p>  While the charging of fees is a commercial decision for regulated entities, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, under Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 (as amended) (&lsquo;the Act&rsquo;), credit institutions must notify the Central Bank if they wish to:</p>  <p>  - Introduce any new customer charge for providing certain services; or</p>  <p>  - Increase any existing customer charge for providing certain services.</p>  <p>  Each notification received by the Central Bank is assessed and robustly challenged in accordance with the specific criteria set out in Section 149 of the Act. Having considered the proposed charge(s) under the assessment criteria as set out under the legislation, the charges are either rejected, approved at lower levels than requested by the credit institution, or approved in full.  Credit institutions are free to impose any pricing differentials for the service up to the permitted maximum and are free to waive charges at their discretion for commercial or competitive reasons.</p>  <p>  Separately, the European Union (Payments Accounts) Regulations 2016 requires that a consumer must be provided with a Fee Information Document setting out all fees linked to an account, in good time before entering into a framework contract. A consumer must also be provided, at least annually, with a Statement of Fees, setting out all fees incurred in respect of the account. These requirements ensure the consumer is fully informed of all fees linked to a payment account.</p>  <p>  If customers are unhappy with their current account provider for any reason, including cost, they have the right to switch to a different provider.

The proposals being considered aim to better position credit unions to grow as a key provider of community banking.</p><p>In developing these proposals, Minister of State Fleming conducted extensive stakeholder engagement, meeting with the representative bodies, collaborative ventures, service providers, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, the Registrar of Credit Unions and individual credit unions. The information gained from these meetings will help inform the next steps taken by Government. </p><p>In terms of supporting the sector to provide essential financial services to local communities, the following are some recent developments which highlight the potential of the sector to grow and fulfil a role in relation to community banking.  </p><p><b>Lending and Investment</b></p><p>The Central Bank has in recent years reviewed both the lending and investment frameworks. Since 1 January 2020, credit unions now have a combined capacity to provide up to &euro;1.1 billion in additional SME and mortgage loans, with further capacity available to credit unions who can comply with certain conditions or on approval by the Central Bank. As of September 2021, credit unions had a combined mortgage and SME loan book of circa &euro;387 million, an increase of 19% year-on-year.  </p><p>Credit unions are permitted to place their surplus funds that have not been lent to members in a range of investments including Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs). Three credit union backed funds have received approval from the Central Bank. Credit unions will be able to invest up to &euro;900 million in these regulated funds, which will subsequently lend to AHBs. </p><p><b>SME Lending </b></p><p>Nineteen credit unions were approved in early 2021 for participation in the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Further, in November five credit unions were announced as participants in the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme (BILS).  </p><p>In total, SME lending has grown 6.9% year on year to end September 2021.  Further development of SME lending in a controlled manner could also assist credit unions in growing and diversifying their loan book. </p><p><b>Access to Finance for Retrofit </b></p><p>The Government significantly increased the funding available to support retrofit. My officials have been engaging with stakeholders to support increased credit union participation in retrofit loan schemes.  </p><p><b>Other Services</b></p><p>Other than member savings and lending, in order to provide &ldquo;additional services&rdquo;, a credit union must receive approval from the Central Bank.  </p><p>68 credit unions are approved to provide current accounts.  </p><p>The Central Bank has prescribed a list of exempt services which may be provided without requiring approval. The Central Bank is undertaking a review of the Exempt Services Schedule to ensure that the services listed reflect the current financial services landscape. The Central Bank has commenced a public consultation seeking views from stakeholders on the proposed changes arising from this review.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-22a.701.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032200067#WRM04900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257 and 258 together.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the total number of taxpayer queries dealt with through its telephone and MyEnquiries service channels for the years 2018 to 2022 (to date) is set out in the table below. Revenue has also confirmed that approximately 68% of queries received through MyEnquiries were responded to within 5 days in 2021, while over 90% were responded to within 20 days. (Revenue&rsquo;s Customer Service Standard across all service channels is within 20 days, or 25 days during peak periods.) Taxpayer queries where further information is needed or where there are complex issues involved can sometimes take longer than the normal 20 day/25 day turnaround time. </p><p>Regarding the average waiting times for the PAYE Helpline, Revenue has confirmed that the peak period for this service occurs during the early months of the year (January to April) when taxpayers submit their income tax returns for the previous year/s, claim any refunds or reliefs to which they are entitled, and check their tax credits for the current year. To date in 2022, the PAYE service has processed over 730,000 tax returns, answered more than 163,000 telephone calls, and dealt with over 224,000 items of correspondence received through the online services and the post.</p><p>To ensure optimum support to PAYE taxpayers throughout the year, Revenue continuously reviews its service channels and deploys its resources on an agile basis to meet demand. For example, analysis of PAYE taxpayer telephone activity indicates that most contacts are received during the morning, with much reduced demand in the afternoon. Operating the PAYE Helpline from 9.30am to 1.30pm each day ensures that the service is there to meet demand while also ensuring adequate resources are available to provide timely replies to queries received through the increasing online channel and through the post. The service is currently answering between 4,000 and 5,000 calls per day while also responding to between 4,500 and 6,000 correspondence items per day.</p><p>Revenue has acknowledged that the average waiting time on the PAYE telephone service during the current peak period is approximately ten minutes. Much of this delay is attributed to clarifying the taxation arrangements for Pandemic Unemployment Payments (PUP) and Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) payments, which can result in some calls taking longer than would normally be the case. It is expected that this waiting time will reduce over the coming weeks as the peak period passes.</p><p>Regarding public office arrangements, I am aware that Revenue has invested very significantly in IT based solutions that allow taxpayers manage their tax affairs at a time that suits them, for the most part without the need to engage directly with officials or visit the tax office. These systems are available on a 24/7 basis, are intuitive and easy to use, and are secure to the highest standards. The online systems include the already mentioned MyEnquiries service, which allows taxpayers send queries to Revenue should they need to do so. As already outlined, most of these queries are responded to within 5 days. The year on year increase in online activity (2020 had reduced customer queries due to COVID-19) is testament to the popularity of the services with taxpayers and significantly negates the requirement to operate public offices.</p><p>However, Revenue accepts that there will always be a requirement for direct discussions where more complex issues exist or where a taxpayer experiences IT related difficulties. To support taxpayers and tax agents where such circumstances arise, Revenue provides a virtual appointment service, which can be booked through a dedicated telephone number (01-7383660).

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions they apply in those policies, nor can I direct insurance companies to provide cover to specific individuals or businesses.</p>  <p>  Having said that, my officials contacted Insurance Ireland for further comment on this matter, so that I could provide some further information. Insurance Ireland stated that its members are focused on ensuring they make it as practical as possible for those arriving from Ukraine to take out policies in their own name over time. It also stated that in general its members are accepting the addition of named drivers who hold a full Ukrainian licence to existing motor policies of Irish host families.  Any charge that applies depends on the individual circumstances of the driver, and if it is a temporary or permanent addition to the motor insurance policy, in some cases no charge will apply. In general at the moment, my officials understand that insurers will treat Ukrainian licences as the equivalent of an EU licence and they will be subject to the same acceptance criteria and rules as EU licence holders. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that issues in relation to driver licencing, including equivalence and exchange issues, are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport and his Department.</p></reply>

This information can be found here - bpfi.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Final-BPFI-Guide-to-Opening-Bank-Accounts-in-Ireland-for-Protection-Applicants-Final.pdf.</p>  <p>  Ukrainian citizens coming to Ireland can use either their passport or their Ukrainian Identity Card as proof of identity. A proof of residence document letter will be provided by the Centre Manager of the International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) Accommodation Centres on request. Those not residing in IPAS accommodation, should inquire with their bank of choice on what would be acceptable as proof of residence.</p></reply>

This extension is in support of Government policy to incentivise the transition to electric vehicles, while the lead in time allows for fleet planning.</p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019 I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1/1/2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles.  The BIK exemption was intended as a temporary measure and forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of electric vehicles, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. </p>  <p>  The onset of the new BIK regime on 1/1/2023 will see electric vehicles benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage (as well as the tapered exemption until end 2025). Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars.</p></reply>

Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance received by the home carer is disregarded for this purpose. </p><p>Where the home carer&rsquo;s income is over &euro;7,200, the tax credit available is reduced by one half of the excess amount earned over this limit. The home carer tax credit will therefore not be available for the 2022 year of assessment where the home carer&rsquo;s income exceeds &euro;10,400.  </p><p>In addition, a couple or civil partners cannot claim both the increased standard rate band for dual income couples and the home carer tax credit in the same year of assessment. In practice, Revenue will grant whichever relief will provide the most beneficial treatment to the couple. </p><p>The home carer tax credit can be claimed through myAccount or by completing an annual Income Tax Return. Taxpayers who do not have access to Revenue&rsquo;s online services can submit a paper claim form.  I am advised that where a person makes a claim for any tax credit, such claims are made on a self-assessment basis and Revenue&rsquo;s &lsquo;presumption of honesty&rsquo; principle, as set out in its Customer Service Charter, applies.  This principle, however, is underpinned by periodic compliance checks to ensure the veracity of tax credit claims based on Revenue&rsquo;s risk prioritisation framework.</p><p>Regarding the automatic application of the home carer tax credit, where this credit is claimed for a year of assessment, Revenue will automatically apply the credit in the following year in certain circumstances. This treatment applies in the scenarios outlined below:</p><p>1.  Where the dependent person is a child in respect of whom either the home carer or his or her spouse or civil partner is in receipt of child benefit. This is subject to the following additional criteria being met:</p><p>1.  the couple are married or in a civil partnership and are jointly assessed to tax;  </p><p>2.  Revenue records indicate that only one spouse or civil partner is in employment;</p><p>3.  Revenue records indicate that the income of the unemployed spouse or civil partner is less than &euro;7,200; and</p><p>4.  Revenue receives confirmation from the Department of Social Protection that either the home carer or his or her spouse or civil partner is in receipt of child benefit. </p><p>Where the dependent person is a person aged 65 years or over, or a person who is permanently incapacitated due to mental or physical incapacity. This is subject to the following additional criteria being met:</p><p>1.  the couple are married or in a civil partnership and are jointly assessed to tax; </p><p>2.  Revenue records indicate that only one spouse or civil partner is in employment;</p><p>3.  Revenue records indicate that the income of the unemployed spouse or civil partner is less than &euro;7,200; and</p><p>4.  there are no details of the home carer or his or her spouse or civil partner being in receipt of child benefit. </p><p>Preliminary End of Year Statements are made available to all employees and pension recipients and may indicate that there has been an underpayment of tax and USC in the year of assessment. In such cases the taxpayer should file an Income Tax Return to ensure that he or she has claimed all tax credits and deductions due, as this may impact the final income tax or USC position. Once a return has been submitted a Statement of Liability will issue, explaining how the underpayment will be collected.</p><p>The Preliminary End of Year Statements in respect of the 2021 year of assessment were made available in January of this year. As there are a number of reasons why an underpayment of income tax may arise, it is not possible to readily identify the number of cases where an underpayment related directly and exclusively to receipt of the home carer tax credit.</p><p>Detailed guidance in relation to the home carer tax credit can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website and Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-29, which are available using the links detailed below:</p><p>-  www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/health-and-age/home-carer-credit/index.aspx, and</p><p>-  www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-29.pdf.</p><p>Alternatively, taxpayers may contact the Revenue office which deals with their tax affairs for assistance in determining the full range of credits and reliefs which he or she may be entitled to claim, based on their personal circumstances.

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.</p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current housing crisis.  The HTB scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. A move to amend the scheme to include second-hand properties would not achieve this aim; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect required in terms of encouraging additional supply of new properties. </p>  <p>  In passing, I might note that the number of housing commencements for 2021 at over 30,700, and up from 21,686 in 2020, is encouraging. As the Deputies may be aware, the Housing for All Strategy has as a  target the construction of an average of at least 33,000 new homes per year out to 2030.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, decisions regarding taxation measures are usually made in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process. Such decisions must have regard to the sound management of the public finances and my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. The guidelines make clear that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures, where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention.</p>  <p>  Finally, I announced in my Budget 2022 address that a formal review of the scheme will take place in 2022. The review will be fundamental in nature and will inform decisions for Budget 2023 and Finance Bill 2022. My Department has recently put the review exercise out to tender.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-22a.742.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032200068#WRN02600"><p>At the outset, the Deputy should note that I am assuming he is referring to a second property as opposed to a second-hand property, and I am responding to his question accordingly.  I would firstly like to note that, for property owners selling their own home there is an exemption from Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for the transfer or sale of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence (PPR), including land of up to one acre around the residence.  More information is available at www.revenue.ie/en/gains-gifts-and-inheritance/cgt-reliefs/index.aspx. </p>  <p>  Taxes on capital including CGT ensure that taxation is not focused solely on income and that those who benefit from gains in the value of their assets are included within the tax net on an equitable basis. Where an individual disposes of a second property, whether through a sale or a gift to a family member, CGT is currently levied at 33% on the chargeable gain usually the difference between the price paid for the asset and the price it is disposed for. </p>  <p>  I would note that in general where the property is inherited after the death of the owner no CGT is due. If the property is gifted while the owner is still alive, while CGT and CAT may be both due, you can use the CGT paid as a credit against the CAT due. The credit cannot be greater than the amount of CAT which is due on the gift or inheritance.</p>  <p>  While I can understand the thinking behind the proposal to exempt property transactions from CGT in order to encourage property owners to sell or gift their property to family members,  taxation is only one of the policy levers available to the Government through which to boost overall housing supply. The presumption should be that non-tax measures should be considered before the use of a tax&ndash;based measure. I would wish to avoid any tax expenditures that could distort the market, particularly where it is not clear that they would in this instance result in additional supply and could reduce the availability of rental properties. Such an exemption would also be unlikely to reduce prices for purchasers. Previous experience with tax incentives in this area has demonstrated a considerable potential for unexpected consequences to such changes which can end up being unhelpful to the broader market. Therefore, I do not currently propose to exempt second properties from CGT. </p>  <p>  The Government is however, very conscious of the need to do everything it can to address the difficulties in the housing market. The comprehensive "Housing for All" plan published last year is intended to deliver more homes of all types for people with different housing needs.  Housing for All includes actions aimed directly at increasing supply in the housing market.  These include 33,000 new units per year, on average, until 2030, (including over 10,000 social and 6,000 affordable units) and an average of &euro;2.4 billion per year in direct State funding to 2025, and &euro;3.5 billion in funding through the Land Development Agency.  The plan commits to a supply of an unprecedented 4,000 affordable purchase homes, on average, every year for families, couples and single people.</p></reply>

PAS has advertised employment opportunities in key publications such as the &lsquo;Traveller Voice&rsquo; Magazine as well as sponsoring the Traveller Education awards.</p>  <p>  As reflected under the Civil Service 2024 Renewal Strategy and the PAS EDI Strategy 2021-2023, my Department and PAS are committed to exploring alternative pathways as a more inclusive approach to attracting underrepresented groups to apply for roles in the civil service.  Leveraging the very positive experiencing of developing disability internships across the civil service, and in line with a core recommendation from the Joint Committee and Pathways to Work 2021-2025, a Pilot Civil Service Internship Programme for members of the Traveller and Roma communities will be launched during Q2 2022, with paid placements of 12 months duration being made available.  </p>  <p>  This Pilot Internship Programme will be hosted by the Department of Justice, who have led out on its development in consultation with an Advocacy Group made up of representatives of the Traveller and Roma communities, and its launch had intentionally been deferred previously owing to pandemic workplace restrictions.  The leanings from this pilot will inform the future development and expansion of the Internship Programme.</p></reply>

The portfolio also encompasses specialised spaces such as public offices, laboratories and cultural institutions, in addition to warehouses, heritage properties, visitor centres and sites.</p>  <p>  In any major portfolio, there will always be a certain level of vacant properties. It is normal to have an amount of space vacant, or vacant properties, at any given time as the portfolio could not function without the flexibility that it provides. Not all vacant properties will be deemed surplus to the State&rsquo;s requirements or deemed suitable for disposal. The OPW has actively pursued its disposal policy over the past number of years.  From 2014 to 2021, the OPW has disposed of 128 surplus properties, generating an income in excess of &euro;22m.  The disposal programme will continue throughout 2022-2023 for 101 currently surplus properties, with 3 auctions already planned.</p>  <p>  The OPW, by default, consults with Local Authorities, the Health Service Executive, Government Departments, the Land Development Agency and other State bodies in relation to any vacant building or site that is surplus to its requirements.  The purpose of consultation with other State bodies is to ascertain a State use or a public interest, in advance of a decision to sell on the open market. Over the past number of years, the OPW has facilitated a number of property disposals to other public bodies to help meet challenges in the housing area in particular.</p>  <p>  If no State use is identified, the OPW considers if open market disposal is an option, depending on prevailing market conditions.  Alternatively, the OPW may consider community involvement, subject to a detailed submission that demonstrates that the community or voluntary group seeking to use the property has the means to insure, maintain and manage it in order to reduce costs to the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  In line with the above policy, the OPW has sought alternative State use for both the former Garda station properties in Dalkey and Kill o' the Grange. </p>  <p>  As no alternative State requirement has been identified for the former Garda station in Dalkey, it is currently being prepared for disposal by public auction.</p>  <p>  The former Garda station in Kill O The Grange is transferring to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council (DLRCC) under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 11/15: Protocols for the Transfer and Sharing of State Property Assets.  The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office has prepared contracts for sale and the OPW and DLRCC are working to complete the transfer over the coming months.</p></reply>

A core objective of funding from my Department is to promote the widest possible participation in cultural, sports and Irish language activities.   Culture 2025, the National Cultural Framework to 2025, recognises the right of everyone to participate in the cultural and creative life of the nation.</p>  <p>  Primary funding for the arts is delivered through the Arts Council.   Across its various funding schemes, the Arts Council supports more than 160 festivals annually. Through its festival investment scheme, the council makes significant investment in festivals nationwide. The addition of festivals supported under the arts grant and strategic funding schemes ensures that there is a flexible and comprehensive support for festivals in Ireland. The Council recognises the distinctive role arts festivals play in sustaining a vibrant and sustainable arts profile at local level. Festivals provide opportunities for artists and audiences to experience new work and ways of making work.  The Arts Council introduced its equality, human rights and diversity policy in early 2019 and is being implemented through its awards.    Further information on gender, disability and ethnicity in individual awards can be found on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  My Department also operates a small-scale local festivals and summer schools funding scheme. The scheme is designed to support local cultural festivals and summer schools which are not in receipt of other essential Government moneys and which may not be eligible under funding criteria for larger scale events supported by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Arts Council or similar bodies.   </p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy  may be interested to note that a number of local authorities support small-scale festivals, in some cases, under the all-of-Government Creative Ireland Programme 2017-2022, led by my Department.  The Programme seeks to enable each citizen to realise their full creative potential with implications for individual, community and national wellbeing.  Under its Creative Communities initiative, annual funding is provided to the 31 local authorities to enable them implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022, with &euro;6.6 million provided in 2021. This funding also supports Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, the national day of free creativity for children and young people. Across the programme of events and initiatives, it is open to local authorities to use some of this funding for creative programming in support of diversity and equality. Creative events have included the Virtual LGBT+ Awareness &amp;amp; Inclusion Youth Festival in Galway, as part of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g 2021. In 2022, on World Down Syndrome Day, an exciting immersive, inclusive and highly participatory piece for children with additional needs, Lullaby Leaf by Ceol Connected, will take place in counties Monaghan, Cavan, Meath, Louth and Galway. </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland as the National Tourism Development Authority, also provide supports for festivals and participative events focus predominantly on internationally-motivating festivals/events from the point of view of inbound international tourism and bednights. More information on these can be found on the agencies' websites. </p></reply>

The BAI, as independent regulator, has issued the General Commercial Communications Code, which provides that, inter alia, commercial communications for infant and follow-on formulae shall comply with all relevant Irish and European legislation and with rules regulations and codes of practice issued from to time by a relevant competent authority.</p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Online Safety and Media Regulation (OSMR) Bill 2022 provides that the new regulator established by the Bill, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, may make codes governing the standards and practices of broadcasters and providers of audio-visual on-demand media services ('media service codes'). In particular section 9 inserts a new section 46N into the Broadcasting Act, which sets out that media services codes may provide for standards and practices to ensure that commercial communications protect the interests of children and that Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n may consult with the relevant public health authorities regarding any provision made for that purpose. </p>  <p>  The OSMR Bill 2022 provides that the existing broadcasting codes in place, including the General Commercial Communications Code, shall remain in force until amended or revoked by Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n.</p>  <p>  Section 44 of the OSMR Bill 2022 provides for the designation of online services for regulation and for the making of binding online safety codes applicable to those services by Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n. In particular, section 44 inserts a new section 139K into the Broadcasting Act 2009 which sets out that an online safety code may make provision with a view to ensuring that service providers take any measures in relation to commercial communications on their services that are appropriate to protect the interests of users of their services, and in particular the interests of children.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these provisions of the Bill as published are sufficient to enable Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, in making and applying media service codes and online safety codes, to rely on the appropriate public health advice from relevant Government Departments and public bodes and to reference and require adherence to the appropriate legislation regulating the marketing of infant and follow-on formulae. As the Minister with responsibility for media regulation, I will ultimately be guided by my colleague the Minister for Health on this matter.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the Sports Action Plan 2021-2023, which was published in November 2021, contains an action to develop and implement a National Swimming Strategy to provide additional swimming opportunities indoors and outdoors. Initial preparatory planning work has been undertaken by my Department in this regard. It is intended to establish a working group in the near future to take forward the detailed work of preparing a national swimming strategy, with a view to its completion and publication later this year.</p><p>The outcome of these reviews and strategies will be fully considered when deciding on the future funding provision for swimming pools.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management manages fire service issues in my Department.  </p>  <p>  Fire services in Ireland are provided by the local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, 31 authorities provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide deliver local authority fire services. 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even when staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in other areas of the local authority sector.  </p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms/ standards established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves.   The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, 'Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response. </p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach, which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires that occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates. </p>  <p>  In May 2021, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management mandated a small internal project team to undertake a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;Retained&rsquo; fire services delivery. This review will have a particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff, with the proviso that due consideration also be given to input from the County and City Management Association. </p>  <p>  The objective of the review is to explore and understand the issues that are impacting on service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options that will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future. The Project Team will work with and report to the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management Fire Service Operations Committee in the performance of its functions. </p>  <p>  The initial engagement element of the review is the gathering of appropriate data and information, to inform the needs analysis and option appraisals for further development. To that end, the project team undertook a procurement process and engaged the services of an independent consultant to survey the views of the personnel who work in the retained fire services and those that have recently retired from the retained fire services. In preparing the survey, the project team sought the views of retained services trade union representatives through the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group. </p>  <p>  That feedback in conjunction with consultation at appropriate stages with all key stakeholders during the review process, including central and local government, fire service management/staff, and the staffing interest groups will form the basis of the final review report. It is the expectation of the project team that the final review report will be submitted to the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management before the end of the year.  </p></reply>

It commits to an examination of defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing&rsquo;s report &quot;Safe as Houses?&quot;. Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates this commitment. </p><p>In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings take place to advance elements of the work. </p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  The full terms of reference of the Working Group are to: </p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between  1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>-  Identification and description of defect,</p><p>-  Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>-  Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>-  Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>-  Period of construction affected,</p><p>-  Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>-  Location of dwellings affected.</p><p>1. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.</p><p>2. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.</p><p>-In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.<ol type="1"><li>Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</li></ol>-  Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>-  Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>-  individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>-  routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>-  Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.</p><p>1. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>2. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>3. Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>As part of its deliberations, the working group is consulting with a wide range of relevant stakeholders.  As part of this stakeholder engagement, the Working Group conducted a series of online surveys between 31 January and 14 March 2022 seeking the experiences of homeowners, landlords, Directors of Owners&rsquo; Management Companies and Property Management Agents. These submissions are currently being analysed.</p><p>The insights gained through engagement with stakeholders as well as the outcome of the online consultation will inform the ongoing deliberations of the Working Group and support the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and finalisation of its report. </p><p>I am satisfied that the Working Group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter, and will require sufficient time to complete its work beyond the end of this month. In that context, I look forward to a report later this year following completion of their consultations and deliberations. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p></reply>

Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for apartments and educational/community/religious buildings. </p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, the regulations will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country,  with limited restriction zones around airports. </p>  <p>  The draft regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. It is anticipated that the formal SEA process will commence, with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the conclusion of  Appropriate Assessment process by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit (EAU). In this connection, the draft regulations are currently being screened for Appropriate Assessment by the EAU and the screening report is expected imminently. The SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside the draft regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to commence shortly. A copy of the draft regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before finalisation of the draft  regulation. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded.  Accordingly, the process for finalising the solar panel planning exemptions will be completed in the coming months. </p>  <p>  While these regulations are being advanced, my Department is concurrently examining the scope to draft supplementary regulations to further expand the exemptions by way of reducing the proposed restriction zones around airports.</p></reply>

However policy regarding energy infrastructure including battery storage is not one in which I have any direct statutory function. In this regard, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to formulate policy and any technical specifications with regard to battery storage. As the Minister concerned has indicated in replies to Question No. 207 of 3 February 2022 and Question No. 42 of 2 March 2022, his Department is presently formulating policy with regard to battery storage and expects to publish this in 2023. Once the Minister concerned publishes policy on this matter, the planning system (i.e. planning authorities and An Bord Pleanala) shall be required to have regard to such new policy and any associated specifications when making determinations on relevant planning applications and appeals. </p>  <p>  In this connection, further to the publication of policy in this area by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, consideration may be given to the need for Section 28 Guidelines for planning authorities in relation to battery storage.  The development of any such guidance would necessitate a joint approach with relevant Departments as well as the regulatory authorities responsible. At this point in time and pending the publication of new policy in this area by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, it is not proposed to develop specific section 28 planning guidelines relating to battery storage.</p></reply>

The aim of the Building Regulations is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. The Building Regulations apply to the design and construction of a new building (including a dwelling) and certain works to an existing building. </p>  <p>  The minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve are set out in the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations. These requirements are set out in 12 parts (classified as Parts A to M). Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each part indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice.  </p>  <p>  There is an overarching requirement under Part D (Material and Workmanship) of the Building Regulations which requires that all works should be carried out:</p>  <p>  - Using proper materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.</p>  <p>  - With a proper standard of workmanship and the appropriate use of any material to achieve compliance with the requirements of the Regulations.</p>  <p>  - By competent persons with sufficient training, experience and knowledge appropriate to the nature of the work he or she is required to perform and having particular regard to the size and complexity of such works so as to ensure a proper standard of workmanship.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for enforcement is delegated to local building control authorities who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers and any person who believes that an offence has been committed is encouraged to report this to the local building control authority in whose area the offence is alleged to have been committed. Building control authorities have strong powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts. Authorised officers of each local building control authority have delegated powers to: -</p>  <p>  - scrutinise proposals and inspect works in progress;</p>  <p>  - serve enforcement notices on owners and builders for non-compliance;</p>  <p>  - institute proceedings for breaches of any requirements outlined in the Acts, or any</p>  <p>  - regulations made thereunder; and</p>  <p>  - seek High Court orders to mitigate danger to the public where serious non-compliance poses risks to public safety.</p>  <p>  Failure by an owner or a builder, at the request of a building control authority, to demonstrate compliance with the Building Regulations or the Building Control Regulations, or to rectify any such non-compliance, may be an offence under the Building Control Acts.  If successfully prosecuted in court, such offences may lead to a fine and/or a term of imprisonment.  The use of these powers is, however, subject to a statute of limitations of five years from the date of completion of the buildings concerned.</p>  <p>  Other significant pieces of redress and producers&rsquo; liability legislation which may apply to construction products are the Sale of Goods Act 1893 and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980; and the Liability for Defective Products Act 1991. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of the important policy area of addressing building defects. Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates this commitment.  In this regard, in 2021 I established a Working Group to examine fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  The Working Group will report to me later this year following completion of their consultations and deliberations. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Regulation of Providers of Building Works Bill 2021 is currently being debated in the Oireachtas. This legislation will put the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing and aims to benefit consumers and the general public by giving those who engage a registered builder the assurance that they are dealing with a competent and compliant operator. The legislation will require providers of building services to register with the appointed statutory body. This will apply to entities or individuals who hold themselves out for consideration as a provider of building works for both residential and non-residential buildings that are subject to the Building Regulations.</p></reply>

The Group's aim is to recommend measures to ensure an equality of outcome between those who receive water services from Irish Water and non-Irish Water customers. </p>  <p>  The terms of reference of the review provide for a two-strand approach. Strand 1 is considering the composition and distribution of funding for the upcoming Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme.  Strand 2 is considering the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the Rural Water Sector. </p>  <p>  The Working Group is currently finalising a report on Strand 1 of its deliberations. The report, to be finalised in coming weeks, will make recommendations on the measures to be considered for funding under the upcoming multi-annual programme. Once I have received the report and had an opportunity to consider its recommendations, I expect to announce details of the programme priorities and an invitation to local authorities, including Mayo, to submit bids will follow. </p>  <p>  Following the receipt of bids, an Expert Panel will evaluate all appropriate bids, and based on the recommendations of the Panel a report will be submitted for my consideration and approval later this year. </p></reply>

Their aim is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. The minimum performance requirements that a building must achieve are set out in the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations. These requirements are set out in 12 parts (classified as Parts A to M). The Building Regulations are set out in functional terms. They are performance based and technology/material neutral. They do not set limitations on the materials. Primary responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.</p>  <p>  The associated Technical Guidance Documents (TGD A - M respectively) provide technical guidance on how to comply with the Building Regulations in practical terms for simple non-complex buildings. Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant technical guidance, such works are considered to be, prima facie, in compliance with the relevant regulations. However, the adoption of an approach other than that outlined in the guidance is not precluded provided that the relevant requirements of the Regulations are complied with. </p>  <p>  Part D (Materials and Workmanship) requires that all works should be carried out in a workmanlike manner using &ldquo;proper materials&hellip;which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used&rdquo; to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations. &lsquo;Proper Materials&rsquo; includes materials which comply with an appropriate harmonised standard or European Technical Assessment or comply with an appropriate Irish Standard or Irish Agr&eacute;ment Certificate or with an alternative national technical specification of any State which is a contracting party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, which provides in use an equivalent level of safety and suitability.</p>  <p>  Cross laminated timber, as a modern method of construction, is not covered by existing standards. Agr&eacute;ment Certificates may be utilised to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations for new innovative products or systems, not covered by existing standards. The assessment is carried out by an independent 3rd party, such as the National Standards Authority of Ireland Agr&eacute;ment (NSAI Agr&eacute;ment).  </p>  <p>  My Department does not have an approval function and does not approve or endorse products for compliance with the Building Regulations or standards. It is critical to ensure that products, systems, and ultimately buildings which are comprised of such products and systems, are designed, constructed, and certified, as fit for purpose, having regard to their intended end use.</p>  <p>  The Building Regulations are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation.</p>  <p>  Part B of the Building Regulations deals with Fire Safety. The associated Technical Guidance Document B (TGD B) provides guidance indicating how the requirements of Part B can be achieved in practice. A fundamental review of Part B (Fire Safety) is underway at present and will take note of the Fire Safety in Ireland report (published in 2018), and consider common and emerging building trends, developments and events from a global perspective, matters relating to external fire spread, external fire resistance, internal fire resistance, cladding systems, sprinklers, etc. Changes in standards, including fire test standards and technological changes in areas such as materials and systems have necessitated a fundamental analysis of the provisions and assumptions contained in Technical Guidance Document B &ndash; Fire Safety.  </p>  <p>  In this context, my Department established a Consultative Committee in December 2020 which has met nine times to date, in addition to a number of sub-group meetings. Draft documentation in the form of revised draft Building Regulations (Part B Amendment) Regulations, Technical Guidance Document B &ndash; Fire Safety, and a Regulatory Impact Analysis are currently being developed with a view to being brought forward for public consultation later this year.</p></reply>

Together these two schemes will support the purchase of 36,000 homes under the Government's Housing for All strategy.</p>  <p>  On the basis that the purchaser of a home will generally require a mortgage to secure a home, I can confirm that in the development of both schemes, my Department is engaging with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland  and its members.  As the First Home Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders, I can confirm that all parties are working with a view to deploying the scheme by the end of Q2 this year. </p>  <p>  Both of the affordable purchase schemes will use an equity support model to assist eligible purchasers.  In the case of Local Authority Affordable Purchase, this equity stake will be equivalent to the reduction in price from the full market value of the home and the stake will be held by the Local Authority. </p>  <p>  In the case of the national First Home scheme, the equity stake will be the funding provided to bridge the gap between someone's maximum mortgage and the price of a new home (within regional price ceilings). </p>  <p>  Under both schemes the purchaser of the home can redeem or &lsquo;buy out&rsquo; this equity stake at a time of their choosing, but there will be no general requirement to do so. If the purchaser chooses not to redeem the equity stake while living in the home, the holder of the stake can do so when the property is sold, or transferred, or after the death of the owner.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that purchasers will use bank mortgages or the Local Authority Home Loan with these schemes, just as in any home purchase, so the equity stake will therefore rank behind whatever loan is secured on the property. The equity support is not a loan, a second mortgage, or any form of 'State debt' and does not take precedence over the debt on the property. </p></reply>

NPO 19 is also aligned with the established approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.</p>  <p>  Under the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing 2005, which were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, planning authorities are required to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way that ensures the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing. The Guidelines are available on the Government&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/23809-sustainable-rural-housing-development-guidelines/  .</p>  <p>  Draft updated Rural Housing Planning Guidelines are currently being finalised that will continue to allow for the development of homes in rural areas while also highlighting the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns in order to avoid over-development of those areas. This will enable a more consistent approach to local need criteria and reference to remote working, appropriate to context. There is a need to screen the draft guidelines for environmental assessment purposes and also to allow for a period of consultation, which means that the timeline for publication of the draft guidelines for consultation will be dependent on whether &ldquo;full&rdquo; environmental assessment of the guidelines is required.</p></reply>

The Environmental Protection Agency, through its Office of Environmental Enforcement, exercises general supervision in relation to the performance of these functions by local authorities. </p>  <p>  In terms of overall national policy, the River Basin Management Plan 2018 - 2021 outlines what Ireland is doing to protect and improve our waters.  This is supported, amongst other measures, by a local authority shared service known as the Local Authority Waters Programme (LAWPRO); by Irish Water&rsquo;s Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024; and by new capital investment for rural water services.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently preparing the third River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, to cover the period 2022 &ndash; 2027. A key commitment in the Programme for Government, the publication of a new strengthened River Basin Management Plan will help deliver a robust and effective policy regarding water services and water quality, along with advancing Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive.</p>  <p>  Building on the work of the second-cycle, this plan will again describe the main pressures and activities affecting water status. The plan will also set out the environmental objectives to be achieved up to 2027 and identify the measures needed to achieve these objectives. It is on this basis that I have instructed officials to examine the report referred to in detail and ensure that appropriate measures are included in the next plan to address all significant pressures impacting on our water bodies, including those found on the Blackwater and Boyne river system. </p>  <p>  A draft of the River Basin Management Plan is currently undergoing a public consultation, which is due to close on 31 March 2022.  Necessary revisions will then be made to take account of the public consultation process and engagement with appropriate stakeholders, before the publication of the final plan later this year.</p>  <p>  This draft plan includes a number of proposed Areas for Action, including the Blackwater Lower in the Meath County Council area and the Blackwater Upper in the Cavan County Council area.  These proposed areas were selected through a collaborative workshop process at each Regional Operational Committee, the membership of which includes key stakeholders such as local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency and Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p>  <p>  To address waste water issues, Irish Water will continue to deliver its capital investment programme.  While progress is being made by Irish Water in reducing the number of waste water plants on the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s priority action list, continued and sustained attention is needed to reduce the impact from insufficiently treated waste water discharges and to meet our Water Framework Directive objectives. In this regard officials from my Department are continuing to engage with Irish Water as part of the River Basin Management Plan making process to ensure a shared understanding of national priorities.   </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I secured funding of over &euro;1.57 billion to support water services. This includes &euro;1.459 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. The overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area. It is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and waste water infrastructure including compliance with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.</p>  <p>  A copy of the draft River Basin Management Plan, along with further supporting documentation including details on how to make a submission, is available from the consultation page on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie/draftRBMP.</p></reply>

The Plans are being revised and updated by local authorities in the light of ongoing engagement and clarifications, and I expect that they will be ready for publication by local authorities before the Summer. They will provide a comprehensive overview of projected delivery of affordable housing in Galway.</p>  <p>  Funding is made available by Government to assist local authority and Approved Housing Body delivery of affordable housing, for purchase and rent, through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF), previously known as the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), and the Cost Rental Equity Loan. The SSF is supporting affordable housing development at Merlin Woods in Galway City, which, according to Galway City Council, will deliver approximately 85 affordable homes to purchase by 2024.</p>  <p>  My Department officials recently met with Galway County Council's Director of Housing and Council colleagues to discuss and progress plans for a number of advance purchase and affordable purchase schemes in Galway County. It is the intention of Galway County Council to make applications to my Department for AHF funding in the coming months.  These schemes are currently at various planning stages, and if funding is approved, delivery of affordable homes will be available for purchase from 2023.</p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme will be delivered via a strategic partnership between the State and participating mortgage lenders and I can confirm that all parties are working with a view to deploying the scheme by the end of Quarter 2 this year.  It will improve access to newly-built homes, below the median price point, by using a shared equity model to bridge the gap between mortgage finance and the cost of new homes. This measure, targeted at First Time or fresh start buyers, will allow purchasers to exit the rental market, help to build developer confidence in realisable consumer demand, and contribute to the recovery of our construction sector following the Covid-19 emergency. It will be available nationwide.</p>  <p>  Other measures to allow buyers to access newly-constructed housing affordably such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Local Authority Home Loan (formerly the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan), are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.  Information on these schemes is available at the following links: </p>  <p>www.revenue.ie/en/property/help-to-buy-incentive/index.aspx, and localauthorityhomeloan.ie/  .</p></reply>

The first, fundamental, reason is that open lines of communication facilitate diplomacy - which is more important than ever in a conflict situation. They allow us to press Russia on the need for a ceasefire, and to allow for effective humanitarian intervention. Communication with the Ambassador also allows us to directly convey our strong disagreement with the Russian Government as it continues to fall short of its obligations.</p>  <p>  Secondly, diplomatic engagement helps us to better protect Irish interests, and to protect our citizens - in Russia and the five central Asian republics for which Ireland is represented by our Embassy in Moscow.</p>  <p>  Finally, we need to consider our actions within the context of the wider EU response. Like all of our other responses during this crisis, we are coordinating closely with EU Member States and like minded partners. When I attended the Foreign Affairs Council on 25 February, I discussed the issue of Russian diplomatic presence with my EU counterparts.

As part of my Department&rsquo;s Human Resources Strategy 2019-2022, a number of initiatives and policies have been advanced to improve gender, equality, diversity and inclusion. In 2019, a dedicated Lead Officer for Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion was appointed who co-ordinates work in this area across the Department. In October 2020 and November 2021 the Department launched two surveys to gather equality data and the views of staff on how we can make further progress in this area, particularly with regard to increasing the diversity of staff employed by the Department. Combined, the results of these surveys will be used to develop a Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, which will be finalised by the end of Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Action plan will include a commitment to increase our outreach to under-represented communities, including members of the Traveller Community and organisations representing the Traveller Community, as part of our outreach initiatives to create greater awareness of employment opportunities within the Department.   </p>  <p>  As part of the Department&rsquo;s Gender, Equality, Diversity and Inclusion training programme, staff will be provided with training on unconscious bias, cultural awareness, and an overview of equality legislation. </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs recognises that more work is required in this area and we are fully committed to making progress in the coming years. As such, we will fully support and engage with any initiatives that emerge out of the recommendations from the Joint Committee on Key Issues Affecting the Traveller Community report. </p></reply>

This is being channelled through trusted humanitarian partners who have an established presence delivering life-saving assistance in the region.</p>  <p>  The first &euro;10 million tranche has been allocated to UN OCHA (&euro;3 million), UNHCR (&euro;3 million), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC; &euro;3 million) and the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC; &euro;1 million), all of whom are active on the ground in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  The second tranche, also &euro;10 million, is being made available to agencies with strong track records and able to respond immediately to needs in Ukraine and those of its neighbours most affected by the conflict, in particular refugee flows. Additional funding is being made available to the UNHCR and ICRC, together with dedicated funding for medical response through the WHO and for protection issues for women and children affected by conflict through UNICEF and UNFPA. A dedicated call for proposals for NGOs ready to respond is being launch. </p>  <p>  Ukrainian civil society organisations that are the first responders in this humanitarian crisis will be supported through the UN OCHA Ukraine Humanitarian Fund which ensures flexible, un-earmarked funding. Irish Aid is also supporting Irish NGO efforts through the Emergency Response Fund Scheme (ERFS), designed to support timely and effective responses to sudden onset humanitarian crises.</p>  <p>  Ireland has provided medical supplies, including blood bags, protective suits, masks and disinfectants, in response to a request from Ukraine via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM), which is coordinating the supply and delivery of support across all EU member states. This mechanism ensures fast and targeted provision of what is needed most. Ireland has also activated its rapid response corps and expects to deploy several experts to work with UN stand-by partners on the humanitarian response.</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland contributes to global funds and provides core funding to key agencies that are allocating funds to Ukraine, including WHO, OCHA, UNHCR, IFRC, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland was amongst the 10 largest donors to the CERF in 2021. Pre-positioned donor funds, including from Ireland, has enabled the CERF to release &euro;55 million in assistance to Ukraine. </p></reply>

Networks such as those are invaluable in keeping channels open with people on the ground in a situation where normal services to send goods directly to individuals are severely disrupted.</p>  <p>  The Government of Ireland has responded quickly and in multiple ways to support people in need. Medical supplies including blood bags, protective suits, masks and disinfectants, have been sent in response to a request from Ukraine via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM), which is coordinating the supply and delivery of support across all EU member states. This mechanism ensures fast and targeted provision of what is needed most. We have also made a &euro;20 million aid package available to trusted humanitarian partners that play a key role delivering life-saving assistance in Ukraine and refugee host countries, including by ensuring the continuity of healthcare services and delivery of medicines throughout Ukraine. This includes partners such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Health Organisation working on the ground across Ukraine, providing critical support, including access to medical supplies. </p>  <p>  People in Ireland who would like to assist are advised to send funds rather than goods. This can be done through donating to established Irish and international humanitarian organisations.

In addition to this long-term funding, our Irish NGO partners can apply directly to the Emergency Response Fund Scheme (ERFS), enabling them to respond in a timely, predictable, and effective manner to emerging humanitarian crises, such as that in Ukraine. </p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the Ukraine crisis, &euro;20 million in Irish Aid funding has been committed to trusted humanitarian partners playing key roles in delivering life-saving assistance on the ground in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  We have allocated funding to partners best positioned to deliver on the ground immediately.</p>  <p>  Among those partners are the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), who are working to ensure, in spite of the access challenges, the continued availability of health care services and the delivery of medicines throughout Ukraine.  Specific Irish Aid funding has also been made available to the WHO, to enable the delivery of essential medical supplies to Ukraine. </p>  <p>  In addition, the HSE, working with the Irish Aid team, and responding to a request from Ukraine, has sent medical supplies, including blood bags, protective suits, masks and disinfectants, to Ukraine via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (EUCPM).  The EUCP is coordinating the supply and delivery of support across all EU Member States to ensure the fast and targeted provision of what is needed most. </p>  <p>  Ireland contributes to global funds and provides core funding to key agencies that are allocating funding to Ukraine, including WHO, OCHA, UNHCR, IFRC, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).   The core funding - essentially prepositioned money - has enabled our partners to respond immediately to the crisis without waiting for additional donor support.  By way of example, the CERF has allocated &euro;55 million to Ukraine since the invasion - Ireland is one of the top ten donors to the CERF.</p>  <p>  Irish Aid is also supporting local civil society organisations in their work providing vital life-saving care and other health services via UN OCHA&rsquo;s Humanitarian Fund.</p></reply>

The EU-China Human Rights Dialogue provides opportunity to raise specific concerns, including in relation to Tibet. Ireland and our EU partners remain committed to ensuring that the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue resumes as soon as possible. The situation of minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang was also raised at the most recent full EU-China Summit in 2020.

In 2021 the Human Rights Council, in addition to its three regular schedule of meetings, also held five special sessions to address urgent crises in: Myanmar; the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and Israel; Afghanistan; Sudan; and Ethiopia. The current 49<sup>th</sup>session of the Human Rights Council included an urgent debate on the Russian invasion of Ukraine before adopting a resolution to establish a commission to investigate violations of human rights.</p><p>Likewise, Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the United Nations Security Council provides an important opportunity to advance our foreign policy priorities, including the promotion and protection of human rights across many of the countries featuring on the Council&rsquo;s agenda.  </p><p>At European Union (EU) level, Ireland is an active participant and contributor to the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, which works globally to support the preservation of peace, the prevention of conflicts and the strengthening of international security. Human rights issues feature prominently at the meetings I attend at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.</p><p>In addition, my officials engage extensively on human rights issues at the relevant Council-level working parties including on the EU&rsquo;s Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, which strengthens the EU&rsquo;s ability to take collective action against perpetrators of human rights violations.</p><p>As always, I will be pleased to provide further detail in relation to individual countries of specific concern.</p></reply>

The Flag Officer Commanding Naval Service is committed to holding the Naval Service to a high standard and maintaining a zero tolerance of the use of illegal substances. </p>  <p>  A number of measures have been put in place to maintain a drugs-free society within the Defence Forces. These measures include: Pre-Enlistment Screening, An Education and Training Programme, Compulsory Random Drugs Testing and Targeted Drugs Testing.</p>  <p>  All members of the Defence Forces, irrespective of rank, with the exception of members of the Army Nursing Service and the Chaplaincy Service, are liable to be tested under the Compulsory Random Drug Testing (CRDT) programme, which was introduced in 2003. Individuals are chosen at random for testing, which is not supported by a warrant, probable cause or any level of particular suspicion. </p>  <p>  Personnel who test positive for controlled substances may be subject to a range of sanctions up to and including Discharge or Retirement from the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, where a positive test result is returned, the member concerned is afforded the opportunity to make representations, to the relevant Military Authority to show cause as to why they should be retained in service.</p>  <p>  On the basis of these representations, a Formation Commander or the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support), may determine that the member should be discharged/retired or may permit the member to remain in service, conditional on their participation in Targeted Drugs Testing (TDT) for a specified period. During this period the member will be placed on administrative duties, which means for example that they cannot engage in any operational activity, training for operational activity or undergo any military course, which involves them being armed.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Officers Commanding the Naval Service units have been instructed to increase the frequency of briefings to all personnel and the Naval Service Assistant Provost Marshall has been instructed to increase Military Police presence.</p>  <p>  During 2021 the Defence Forces drug testing team conducted 388 random drug tests in a total of 14 different locations. Of these, there were 7 positive results which represents 1.08% of the numbers tested. This is broadly in line with the general trend over the past number of years.</p></reply>

In the current school year, over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is obliged to tender all works, goods and services to be provided by external suppliers in line with national and EU procurement legislation and this includes services provided by contractors under the School Transport Scheme.  Compliant tenders are evaluated against published award criteria. Successful tenderers are awarded a contract for up to five years.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education is considering in consultation with other relevant departments and Bus &Eacute;ireann the implications that increasing fuel costs may have on the provision of school transport services.  The Department is also very aware of the potential impact of the current situation unfolding in Ukraine which is impacting fuel prices further.   </p>  <p>  Government has announced a reduction in excise on fuel will result in a decrease in the cost of fuel.  The reduction of 20 cent per litre on petrol and 15 cent per litre on diesel will be in place until 31 August at an estimated cost of &euro;320m. This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time. </p></reply>

My Department already has data on capacity and under/over subscription at individual schools from its National Inventory of School Capacity based on schools&rsquo; annual enrolment returns, and utilises its Geographic Information System to facilitate spatial analysis of this and other data. </p>  <p>  On a national level, total primary enrolments peaked in 2018 and have been reducing since.  The net overall reduction in primary enrolments by 2022/23 was projected to be in the order of 25,000 pupils.  At post-primary level, demographics are generally continuing on an upward trend. </p>  <p>  Nevertheless, at both primary and post-primary level there are significant variances in available capacity at local and regional level across the country, in both rural and urban areas and assessment of school place requirements and available capacity at a local level is, therefore, being undertaken.  Ultimately, the location of the accommodation provided for the Ukrainian families will be relevant in maximising the utilisation of existing school capacity to meet their education needs and my Department is coordinating with other Government Departments in this respect, with a view to ensuring alignment of our planning processes as much as possible.</p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.</p><p>It is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools  in the area</p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p><p>- Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area.</p><p>My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in Dublin 8,10 and 12 to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train. The Department's priority is to ensure that there are sufficient school places overall in a School Planning Area.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands. It is expected that the enrolment pressures in these, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the area in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can also be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p><p>Specifically, in Dublin 8,10 and 12 areas, a significant number of school building projects providing additional capacity and refurbished accommodation at primary school level are in train. A list of these projects, indicating the current status of the projects in these school planning areas, is attached for the Deputy's information.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  </p>  <p>  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach was being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>On the 24th February, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a package to settle the claim was proposed which F&oacute;rsa have agreed to recommend to its members. A ballot will now be undertaken and we await the outcome. The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.</p>  <p>  In addition to an incremental salary scale, secretaries may also choose to receive additional increments if they decide that they no longer wish to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The package of proposals on offer to school secretaries also include standardised terms and conditions in relation to  annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.</p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries at present. As set out in the framework agreement of 14 September 2021, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. Should the proposal be agreed and an implementation plan put in place, intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p>  <p>  This agreement is further acknowledgment of the excellent and often unheralded work carried out on the ground by secretaries and caretakers in our schools. I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s decision to ballot their members on this agreed suite of measures for staff who are the beating heart of our school community. This important step forward is the result of great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and I would encourage school secretaries to vote in favour of it. </p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with forty eight research projects at various stages including its joint SEAI partnership energy website project <i>www.energyineducation.ie</i>.</p><p>Solar PV is also funded for schools that are having their electrical installations replaced.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will also build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050. </p><p>My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are involved in an energy efficient retrofit pathfinder scheme for schools since 2017.  </p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.  </p><p>The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland which will include solar PV. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan. </p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 Annex of Actions published this year includes for the introduction of  interim regulations amending solar panel planning exemptions, with defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes for solar installations in Q1 2022 and once published will be considered by my Department.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department engaged with the Joint Oireachtas Committee with regard to education matters. </p><p>With regard to the recommendations pertaining to my Department, my Department provides a wide range of supports to all schools to ensure that all students have their educational needs met, to support the inclusion of all students, including Traveller students, and to address barriers to students achieving their potential.</p><p>National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy </p><p>The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) provides a framework for action on Traveller and Roma issues. Actions to advance Traveller education outcomes form part of this Strategy. My Department participated in the development of the NTRIS, which contains over 30 education-related actions, from early years to further and higher education, and officials will be working with the Department of Further and Higher Education Research Innovation and Science, and engaging with and supporting the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in its review of the Strategy and development of the next iteration of the Strategy as committed to in the Programme for Government. Officials from my Department attend the NTRIS Plenary Steering Group meetings in addition to the NTRIS Education subgroup, which meet regularly throughout the year.</p><p>DEIS - Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools</p><p>DEIS is the main policy instrument of my Department to tackle educational disadvantage at school level. Schools in the DEIS programme avail of a range of targeted supports aimed at tackling educational disadvantage, including additional classroom teaching posts, home school community liaison coordinator posts, DEIS grant funding and access to the School Completion Programme. The DEIS Plan includes specific actions in relation to Traveller and Roma education to promote improvements in school attendance and completion. </p><p>Budget 2022 has allocated the largest-ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme, providing for an additional allocation of &euro;18 million in 2022 and rising to an additional &euro;32 million in 2023. This means that by 2023 my Department will target over &euro;180 million at addressing educational disadvantage through the DEIS programme, an increase of 20%. On 9 March this year, I announced a major expansion of the programme, with the inclusion of an additional 310 schools and the reclassification of an additional 37 existing DEIS schools, making these eligible for increased supports.</p><p>The refined DEIS identification model captures a greater breadth of disadvantage than the earlier model. Importantly, it takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners, as well as of students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Thus, the expansion has extended the additional targeted supports of the DEIS programme to those schools serving high concentrations of students at risk of educational disadvantage ensuring that the largest investment to date in the DEIS programme is being provided to those schools most in need.</p><p>Wellbeing in schools</p><p>The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice 2019 sets out the ambition and vision of the Department that the promotion of wellbeing will be at the core of the ethos of every school and centre for education in Ireland. It acknowledges that schools provide opportunities to develop friendships and to respectfully encounter diversity and access support structures. The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach to supporting wellbeing, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health.</p><p>Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of their own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.</p><p>Anti-Bullying Measures</p><p>The 2013 Action Plan on Bullying sets out my Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools. On 16 February, I announced the establishment of a new Steering Committee to review the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and develop a new Action Plan. This review will take account of the significant developments and relevant research since the action plan was published. </p><p>This includes research published last week by DCU and commissioned by my Department in line with NTRIS actions on the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s anti-bullying procedures on Traveller and Roma experiences in the school system. It is entitled A study into the effectiveness of the Anti-Bullying Procedures on Traveller and Roma pupils&rsquo; experiences in the school system, and is available here: </p><p>The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health, published last August. The anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools will also be reviewed and updated in parallel with this work.</p><p>Traveller Culture and History</p><p>I am fully supportive of measures to improve educational outcomes for Travellers, which includes ensuring that the school setting is a more welcoming environment. Developing knowledge and understanding of Traveller culture and history in schools will help build a recognition of the important value of Traveller culture and history to this country and help to improve a sense of belonging for Traveller children in schools.  </p><p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) published an audit of Traveller culture and history in the curriculum in 2019, which has provided the basis for further work in this area which is being progressed. A full-time Education Officer was appointed in September, 2020 to progress the next steps which include:</p><p>- identifying existing initiatives and supports across the three education sectors (early childhood, primary and post-primary) and exploring how they can be further enhanced, supported and possibly replicated; - identifying existing resources and materials and exploring the kinds of new support material and resources that need developing;</p><p>- working directly with early childhood settings and schools to identify good practice underpinned by principles of inclusion, intercultural education, and learning about Traveller history and culture.</p><p>An expert advisory group has been established by the NCCA, which includes representatives and members of the Traveller community to inform the work being carried out by NCCA. </p></reply>

SENOs also make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology/specialised equipment is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support.</p><p>In order to qualify for equipment under the assistive technology scheme, a student must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the student to access the curriculum.</p><p>It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.

This includes details of the status of these schools as well as of enrolments.</p><p>The Statistics page also provides information on school ethos. In the city of Dublin, the majority of schools with a Catholic ethos are under the patronage of the Archbishop of Dublin, the majority of Church of Ireland schools are under the patronage of the Archbishop of Dublin and Bishop of Glendalough, while those that are multi-denominational are predominantly under the patronage of Educate Together. Should the Deputy wish to establish the patron of a particular school or schools, this can be provided.</p><p>While my Department collates a National Inventory of School Capacity from information provided by schools as part of their enrolment returns, it is a matter for school authorities to determine the available school places in any individual school and to set out the school&rsquo;s Admissions Policy. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware for school planning purposes, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and utilises a Geographical Information System (GIS) to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.</p><p>It is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p><p>- Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools  in the area</p><p>- School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p><p>- Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p><p>- External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area.</p><p>My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in Dublin 8,10,12 and 20 to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train. The Department's priority is to ensure that there are sufficient school places overall in a School Planning Area.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands. It is expected that the enrolment pressures in these, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak.</p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the area in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can also be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p><p>Specifically, in Dublin 8,10, 12 and 20 areas, a significant number of school building projects providing additional capacity and refurbished accommodation at primary school level are in train. A list of these projects, indicating the current status of the projects in these school planning areas, is attached for the Deputy's information. </p></reply>

The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  </p>  <p>  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting where possible initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school. </p>  <p>  In June 2021, the Steering Group presented an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved temporary alleviation measures which allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review.  As part of this phase of the review, my Department has conducted an extensive stakeholder engagement process. My Department is analysing the views of relevant stakeholders, including parents, guardians, students and other Government Departments, so that they may be considered as part of the assessment and in informing policy on the future operation of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Individual queries may be addressed to School Transport Section of my Department at  school_transport@education.gov.ie  </p></reply>

The State Examinations Commission, with my Department, has been progressing planning for these examinations, in consultation with the Advisory Group on Planning for the State Examinations, which met on a number of occasions to consider this matter. I also met with members of the group on a bilateral basis.     </p>  <p>  Following consideration of this matter by Government on 1 February I announced decisions regarding this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle examinations.</p>  <p>  I was happy to confirm that the Junior Cycle examinations will take place as normal this summer for the first time since 2019, having been cancelled in 2020 and 2021 on foot on Public Health advice due to the impact of Covid-19.  I was strongly of the view that these examinations should proceed this year. 2022 is the first year that all of the new subject specifications for Junior Cycle will be assessed by the State Examination Commission.   </p>  <p>  A number of adjustments to the assessment arrangements for Junior Cycle have been published in recent months, to take account of the impact of Covid, and will provide for more teaching time in schools. These include the following:</p>  <p>   - As part of Junior Cycle, students normally complete two classroom-based assessments (CBAs) in each subject. In this current school year, however, each student must complete a minimum of only one CBA in each subject.</p>  <p>  - The school has autonomy in deciding which CBAs will be completed by students with two exceptions. In the case of the languages and practical subjects the CBA that students complete is specified because it is linked to the externally assessed practical examination.</p>  <p>  - As CBAs are school-based assessments, schools have been advised that there are flexibilities in the windows for completion of the CBAs in light of particular circumstances schools may encounter due to COVID-19.</p>  <p>  - The Assessment Task, which is usually assessed and marked by the SEC, will not be assessed in 2022 in the relevant subjects. Instead the written examination will account for 100% of the marks;</p>  <p>  - Adjustments have been made to the requirements for practicals and coursework in subjects including for example, Music, Home Economic, Art and the Technologies.</p>  <p>  - No changes have been made to the written examination papers because of the design of the new specifications for Junior Cycle. The Junior Cycle examination papers are completed in a booklet format with students required to answer all questions. The papers are designed to assess the subject specifications in an integrated way, reflecting the way in which teachers&rsquo; expertise is used to plan for delivering the subjects using integrated strands and elements. Any adjustments made to these papers at this stage would make them fundamentally different from expectations and would be more likely to disadvantage than to benefit students.</p></reply>

These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage.  In the 2022/23 academic year there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS Programme - 960 Primary and 234 Post Primary. This will also mean a &euro;32million increase in my Department's expenditure on DEIS programme from 2023. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and will extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest proportions of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model which uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The DEIS identification model now takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p>  <p>  Schools that have not been included in the DEIS programme at this time will have an opportunity to have that decision reviewed. My Department will provide further information in the coming days on this appeals process on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

At primary level, this situation generally arises to cater for a school&rsquo;s accommodation requirements where an additional teaching post has been sanctioned by Teacher Allocation Section, or a new SEN class has been sanctioned by the NCSE, and all available alternative accommodation within the school is already being used for classroom purposes.</p>  <p>  The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics particularly at post-primary level and for special education needs provision. The Deputy will appreciate that the immediate priority of my Department is providing new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place.</p>  <p>  However, the second half of the National Development Plan period will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock. This will include a PE Hall build and modernisation programme to ensure that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision.</p>  <p>  The school submitted an ASA application in 2020 for a PE hall and funding for this application was refused.  The school has recently appealed this decision and once this appeal has been assessed, the school authority will be contacted directly with a decision.</p></reply>

The Department then provides grant aid to the school in respect of the rental costs.  </p><p>While it is the policy of my Department to ensure a high standard of permanent accommodation for all schools, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population over the last decade or more it is sometimes necessary to make use of rental of properties as interim solutions to meet the accommodation needs of schools. Furthermore, it may also be necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation when an immediate or short term need arises. For example, a school may require a temporary site or building in circumstances where a major school construction project is planned. The rental is terminated when the major project concerned is completed. The length of time it is necessary to make use of the rented property will vary from project to project.</p><p>There are approximately 1,200 school building projects within the current pipeline across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction - most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period 2022 to 2025.  The progression and completion of these projects is and will make further inroads on the replacement of rented sites and buildings with knock-on savings on the rental budget.</p><p>Many schools based in rented buildings and on rented sites are already part of the pipeline of projects under the school building programme and their longer-term accommodation will be addressed as part of these projects.  Maximising the opportunities to achieve value for money involves matching, as best as possible, the accommodation requirement with the appropriate accommodation solution. This is relevant for all accommodation projects progressed by the Department.</p><p>The changing landscape in relation to enrolments means that accommodation requirements can vary regionally and between short, medium and long-term and this is a relevant factor considered by the Department in determining the type of accommodation solution to be put in place.</p><p>Following is a list of schools in Galway city &amp;amp; county where the Department is funding the lease of buildings and/or land.</p></reply>

It is expected that the enrolment pressures in North Dublin, and in other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak.  In terms of projects, there has been significant investment under the Major Capital Programme in the north Dublin area in recent years. Bremore Educate Together, Balbriggan has a new school building for 1,000 pupils completed in 2018. Col&aacute;iste Glor na Mara, also in Balbriggan was completed in 2019 and also has accommodation for 1,000 pupils. In addition there are 13 other major projects at post primary level in the north Dublin area, including at Belmayne, Malahide, Portmarnock, Swords, Dublin 15 and Rush which are at various stages of the design and build process, and will greatly contribute to the supply of school places in the area.  <b></b></p><p>Additionally, the Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified.  </p><p>Included among additional accommodation projects are Dominican College, Drumcondra, Col&aacute;iste Dh&uacute;laigh, Coolock and Santa Sabina Dominican College, Sutton. Clonturk Community College has been approved a significant amount of modular accommodation to cater for their needs. St. Aidan&rsquo;s, Whitehall has also been approved for a significant project, which has been devolved to the school authorities for delivery. My Department is also engaging with school authorities at Castleknock Community College and Luttrelstown Community College in order to consider their accommodation needs. </p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  In general, children with special educational needs are eligible for school transport if they are attending the nearest school that is resourced to meet their special educational needs. Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of Special Education Needs Organisers.  A Special Transport Grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements may be provided to families of eligible children in certain situations such as where Bus &Eacute;ireann is not in a position to provide a transport service or where a child's age, behavioural difficulties or medical needs are such as to make the provision of a transport service impracticable;</p>  <p>  The reduction in excise on fuel which has been agreed by Government will result in a decrease in the cost of fuel.  The reduction of 20 cent per litre on petrol and 15 cent per litre on diesel will be in place until 31 August 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;320m. This is a national measure aimed at easing the financial burden on contractors and families at this time.  </p>  <p>  As you may be aware my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme,  its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately.</p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are taking place in the current phase of the review which is now underway. The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses, with a view to presenting a final report with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme. </p></reply>

These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage.  In the 2022/23 academic year there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS Programme - 960 Primary and 234 Post Primary. This will also mean a &euro;32million increase in my Department's expenditure on DEIS programme from 2023. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and will extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest proportions of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model which uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The DEIS identification model now takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p>  <p>  Schools that have not been included in the DEIS programme at this time will have an opportunity to have that decision reviewed. My Department will provide further information in the coming days on this appeals process on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>The key drivers of capital investment in the schools sector are as follows:</p><p>- demographic change, </p><p>- alignment with housing provision and national planning at school planning area level, </p><p>- construction costs,</p><p>- climate action objectives including deep energy retrofit. </p><p>In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System, using data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p><p>Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes.</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools. </p><p>In addition to ongoing demographic analyses, my Department continues to liaise with Local Authorities in respect of potential longer-term requirements for educational provision across the country, through the review of the County Development Plans, preparation of Local Area Plans and other relevant statutory planning processes.</p><p>During the period 2018 to 2021 691 school building projects were completed. These projects delivered in excess of 64,000 school places. Since 2018, 47 new schools have been announced.</p><p>My Department is aware of the challenges of Covid and the challenging market conditions currently underway and is working proactively to ensure that all school building contracts are awarded as expeditiously as possible, while working within the parameters set by the Office of Government Procurement and principles of public procurement set out at both national and EU level.</p><p>There is a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements of this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,200 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. Most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025 and are being progressed as quickly as possible.</p><p>There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage. It is anticipated that 150 to 200 school building projects will be completed annually during the 2022 to 2025 period.</p><p>The current status of these projects being delivered is listed on a county by county basis on www.gov.ie and is updated on a monthly basis to reflect their progress through the various stages.</p></reply>

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools</p>  <p>  The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually.

Of the appeals processed to date 10 were upheld.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application and payment process on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  Children who apply for school transport but who are not eligible are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats. </p>  <p>  In cases where the Department is satisfied that the nearest school is full, eligibility for school transport will be determined based on the distance that children reside from their next nearest school having regard to ethos and language. To establish that the nearest school is full parents/guardians must provide certain documentary evidence including confirmation that an application for enrolment in the nearest school was made within the deadline dates specified by the school and confirmation from the school authorities that the school was full.</p>  <p>  As you are aware my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. </p>  <p>  In June 2021, the Steering Group presented an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved temporary alleviation measures which allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time. </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review. The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses. </p>  <p>  Individual queries may be addressed to School Transport Section of my Department at  school_transport@education.gov.ie</p></reply>

Additionally, the Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified. The current status of these projects being delivered is listed on www.gov.ie and is updated on a monthly basis to reflect their progress.</p></reply>

These schools were identified as having the highest levels of educational disadvantage.  In the 2022/23 academic year there will be 1,194 schools in the DEIS Programme - 960 Primary and 234 Post Primary. This will also mean a &euro;32million increase in my Department's expenditure on DEIS programme from 2023. This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and will extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest proportions of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.</p>  <p>  This announcement follows an extensive body of work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model which uses information from the Department of Education enrolment databases and the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The DEIS identification model now takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p>  <p>  Schools that have not been included in the DEIS programme at this time will have an opportunity to have that decision reviewed. My Department will provide further information in the coming days on this appeals process on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in a number of school planning areas including in east Cork.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  - Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools  in the area</p>  <p>  - School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  - Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  - External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in east Cork to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train. </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands. It is expected that the enrolment pressures in these, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the area in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can also be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p>  <p>  Specifically, in east Cork, there are a number of significant school building projects providing additional capacity at post primary level:</p>  <p>  - Carrigtwohill Community College (76333G) is a co-educational post primary school with an enrolment  of 535 for the 2021/2022 school year. A project to provide a permanent  school building for 1,000 pupils is currently at Stage 3.  Interim accommodation has been approved for the 2022/23 school year consisting of 6 general classrooms, 1 home economics room, 1 Class SEN base and 2 social spaces pending delivery of new build.</p>  <p>  - St Aloysius College, Carrigtwohill, (62140P) is an all girls post primary school with an enrolment of 792 for the 2021/2022 school year. A project to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils has been devolved to the school authority for delivery.</p>  <p>  - Christian Brothers Secondary School Midleton (62360G) is an all-boys post primary school with an enrolment of 907 pupils for the 2021/22 school year. A project to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,000 pupils has been devolved to the school authority for delivery.</p>  <p>  - St Mary&rsquo;s High School, Midleton (62380M) is an all girls&rsquo; post primary school with an enrolment of 758 pupils for the 2021/2022 school year. In respect of the 2022/23 academic year the Department is working closely with CEIST as patron of St. Mary&rsquo;s High School, Midleton, who are delivering interim accommodation at this school to facilitate provision of the required school places.  The Department continues to engage with the school patron in respect of  a project for a new school building for St. Mary&rsquo;s High school to cater for 1,000 pupils.</p>  <p>  - Pobailscoil na Trion&oacute;ide,  Youghal, (91513S) is a co-educational post primary school with an enrolment of 1005 pupils for the 2021/2022 school year. A project to facilitate its expansion to cater for 1,200 pupils has been devolved to the school authority for delivery.  Interim accommodation was approved for the 2021/22 school year to facilitate school expansion (6 classroom units)</p>  <p>  - Col&aacute;iste Mhuire, Cobh   (62180E) is a co-educational school which had an enrolment of 702 pupils for the 2021/2022 school year. A devolved grant has been approved to the  school to facilitate its expansion.</p>  <p>  Additionally, the Department is continuing to engage with all patrons of schools in the area to identify any additional required interim solutions to meet the need for post primary places in the East Cork area. My Department will continue to work to advance these and other projects in East Cork and to ensure sufficient mainstream and SEN school places at both primary and post primary level.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process and paid on time are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p>  <p>  A minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus &Eacute;ireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits.</p>  <p>  All school transport services are reviewed over the summer months. Arising from this review, routes may be altered, extended or withdrawn depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year. </p>  <p>  Parents of a child wishing to avail of school transport services are required to apply on-line on Bus &Eacute;ireann website at www.buseireann.ie </p>  <p>  The closing date for receipt of applications  for school transport for the 2022/23 school year is Friday, 29 April, 2022.  It is important that parents apply on time as a seat may not be guaranteed for late applications. </p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport, are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.</p>  <p>  Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places, in these cases Bus &Eacute;ireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using a random selection process.  </p>  <p>  As you are aware my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  </p>  <p>  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting where possible initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school. </p>  <p>  In June 2021, the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved temporary alleviation measures which allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time.  </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review.  As part of this phase of the review, my Department has conducted an extensive stakeholder engagement process. My Department is analysing the views of relevant stakeholders, including parents, guardians, students and other Government Departments, so that they may be considered as part of the assessment and in informing policy on the future operation of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Further information relating to school transport is available on my  Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.</p></reply>

If the school is interested in re-joining the schools broadband programme, the school should record their request with the Schools Broadband Service Desk and the school will be included in the next available tender for broadband services to schools, at which point the level of connectivity that can be provided can be determined. The Schools Broadband Service Desk is the Department's dedicated service for schools in programme, which is managed by the Professional Development Service for Teachers - Technology in Education (PDST-TiE). They can be contacted by phoning 1800334466 or by emailing broadbandservicedesk@pdst.ie.</p>  <p>  The school referred to is included in the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area, and my Department is working closely with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on the implementation of the National Broadband Plan Intervention area, including the School Connection Points under the Broadband Connection Points programme, all of which will see some 679 primary schools provided with high speed connectivity by 2023.

My intention is to bring a holistic recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March this year.</p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This will allow Ukrainian citizens and others fleeing Ukraine to avail of supports throughout the EU.  I wish to emphasise that people arriving from Ukraine have been granted the status to avail of income supports from my Department under the EU Temporary Protection Directive.  </p>  <p>  My Department has an excellent record in reacting quickly and appropriately to emergency situations.  The Department&rsquo;s immediate priorities are the allocation of PPSNs and the provision of immediate financial supports. A fast-track approach has been put in place which includes a simplified decision-making process and quick processing of PPSNs to allow access to public services.  </p>  <p>  People will be eligible for financial support initially under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  Ukrainian citizens and others fleeing the war will satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition and the relevant means test.   </p>  <p>  We are aiming to ensure that the customer&rsquo;s application for Supplementary Welfare Allowance is processed as quickly and efficiently as possible to provide immediate financial assistance. Thereafter they can apply for a social welfare payment appropriate to their circumstances such as state pensions, jobseeker's allowance, one parent family payment and disability allowance.  We have  also arranged for payments such as child benefit to be made within a very short period. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the Department of Justice are in Dublin Airport to meet with people arriving from Ukraine and they will ensure that temporary residence certificates and PPSNs are allocated and the appropriate financial supports are provided.  </p>  <p>  A number of additional dedicated centres are also being set up at locations across the country. Centres in Dublin city centre and Cork city centre have opened, with an additional dedicated centre to open in Limerick later this week. The Department's network of Intreo offices around the country is also being used to help people from the Ukraine who arrive in the country.  </p>  <p>  We will seek to ensure that all those fleeing the war in Ukraine that will arrive here will be provided with what is required to help them access other public services and receive the appropriate financial supports. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputies at this time.  </p></reply>

In this regard, Pathways to Work 2021-2025, the national employment services strategy, was launched in July 2021, and includes targeted measures that closely align with the Report&rsquo;s recommendations, such as to:</p>  <p>  - Engage with community representative bodies to produce Traveller specific employment service engagement tools, due in Q4 2022;</p>  <p>  - Consult with stakeholders from the Traveller community to advise the Public Employment Service, due in Q2 2022; and,</p>  <p>  - Further develop specific Community Employment schemes for Travellers and Roma, due in Q4 2023.</p>  <p>  The Report by the Joint Committee recommends developing a comprehensive national Traveller employment action plan.  This is also a commitment in Pathways to Work and my officials are closely engaging with Traveller representative groups from the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy Employment Sub-Group in this regard. </p>  <p>  In line with the Report&rsquo;s recommendation that participants who are far from the labour market should be allowed to remain on Community Employment (CE), the Deputy may be aware that the eligibility criteria have been relaxed for members of the Traveller community. Ordinarily, to be eligible for CE, participants must be over 21 and in receipt of a relevant payment for 12 months or more. However, Travellers aged 18 or over, in receipt of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance for any length of time, can avail of CE. </p>  <p>  Improving the labour market outcomes of disadvantaged groups is a key aim of the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy.  I welcome the recommendations from the Report, which aligns with this effort, and my officials are examining how best to implement the full range of recommendations. By working on a whole of Government basis, and in conjunction with Traveller representative groups, the commitments set out above will work to support meaningful change and enhanced employment prospects for the Traveller community in Ireland.</p></reply>

The level of furnishings and appliances required will depend on an assessment of the size and nature of the property, the expected level of occupancy and items already available to the customer.  Every case is based on the individual circumstances and needs of the household. </p>  <p>  Consideration is also given to the basis on which the property had been procured by the Voluntary Housing Body and if responsibility for the provision of any household goods rests elsewhere.</p>  <p>  ENPs towards household furnishings and goods are not generally considered where the accommodation is neither built nor owned by the Housing Body. </p>  <p>  Properties that are leased under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme, formerly known as the Social Housing leasing initiative, are subject to the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019.  The regulations outline the household goods which should be in the property at the time of leasing by the Voluntary Housing Body.  The household goods referred to in the regulations include certain appliances commonly known as &ldquo;white goods&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Community Welfare Officers in Laois had understood that as the properties were leased by the Voluntary Housing Body and owned by private landlords the units were subject to the housing regulations.  It was initially determined the provision of white goods and associated maintenance was therefore the responsibility of the landlord and not the tenant.</p>  <p>  However, it has since been clarified that landlords who enter long term leases of more than 10 years  are not legally obliged to provide white goods. </p>  <p>  My officials in the Community Welfare Service have initiated contact with the Housing Officer following this clarification and will work collaboratively and promptly to ensure any person adversely impacted previously will have their ENP application re-examined.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Those eligible for jobseekers will move onto a jobseeker payment from 5 April 2022. </p>  <p>  To be eligible for Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseekers Benefit Self Employed a person must satisfy all the qualifying conditions of the statutory scheme. In the case of Jobseekers Benefit Self Employed a person must have permanently ceased their previous self employment and satisfy the relevant contribution requirements. The social insurance condition requires that self employed people have at least 156 weeks of Class S contributions or at least 104 weeks of paid Class A or H PRSI since first starting work and 52 weeks of Class S contributions paid in the General Contribution Year (GCY). The GCY is the second-last complete tax year before the year in which a claim is made. So, for claims made in 2022, the relevant tax year is 2020.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020, provides, amongst other measures, for the attribution of social insurance contributions to insured persons who were beneficiaries of certain Covid-19 income support payments including PUP.  </p>  <p>  If a self-employed customer was entitled to and in receipt of PUP, or a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment in lieu of PUP,  and was not liable to make a self-employment contribution in respect of the 2020 contribution year, they have been attributed 52 self-employment contributions in respect of that year. The issue of a person not having sufficient contributions for 2020 should not generally arise, unless for example in the case of a person who did not file an annual return of income to Revenue in line with the deadline.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy is aware of a specific case, he should provide the details to the Department for review.  </p>  <p>  Where a person, including those engaged in self-employment, does not satisfy the conditionality for receipt of Jobseekers Benefit they may apply for means tested Jobseeker's Allowance. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position. </p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children until their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a disability. Child Benefit is currently paid to over 631,000 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2.1 billion in 2022. </p>  <p>  The Government recognised the challenges of rising prices last October in Budget 2022 when we brought in a package of tax and social welfare measures worth over &euro;1 billion. Last month, the Government agreed a further package of &euro;505 million, including the &euro;200 energy credit and a lump sum payment of &euro;125 for those in receipt of the fuel allowance. This month the Government brought in a further tax measure, to immediately reduce the cost of fuels for families and businesses.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I increased the rates for a qualified child aged under 12 by &euro;2 to &euro;40 per week, and for a qualified child aged 12 or older by &euro;3 to &euro;48 per week, from January. I increased the level of the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance by &euro;10 to &euro;160 for each child aged 4 to 11 years and to &euro;285 for each child aged 12 and over. I also equalised the income limits for one and two parent households, thereby making it easier for lone parents to qualify for that payment.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also provided for a &euro;10 weekly increase in the income limits for Working Family Payment, and I am pleased that this will now come into effect from April, 2022 as part of the Government's response to cost of living increases.</p>  <p>  Any proposal for an increase in Child Benefit payment rates would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context. </p></reply>

The role of the service support worker is crucial in providing these services.</p>  <p>  I refer to your question on behalf of Kilbarrack Coastal Community Programme (KCCP) regarding difficulty experienced recruiting CE participants as youth support and drug rehabilitation support workers. I understand that KCCP Scheme has 42 approved CE places with 33 of these places currently filled. Where vacancies occur on CE schemes, eligible candidates are identified by my Department&rsquo;s  activation services and are referred to fill placements on CE schemes. Jobseekers can also register their interest through www.jobsireland.ie, the Department&rsquo;s online job advertising and recruitment service website or by contacting a case officer in their local Intreo Centre. CE candidates are then referred to the CE scheme once their eligibility has been confirmed and CE is considered a suitable activation measure for that jobseeker.  Referrals are being made to KCCP by the Department's activation service; however, some of the candidates referred unfortunately have not been deemed suitable for the specific roles being sought.  </p>  <p>  In order to support these schemes, Minister Humphreys and I have extended funding for CE participant contracts up until the 8th April.  Participants with extended contracts will leave schemes in a phased coordinated manner over the following twelve months.</p>  <p>  In a further change intended to assist with the transition from COVID emergency supports over the next period, participants, including those with extended contracts, may not be required to leave CE, where a suitable replacement has not yet been referred to the scheme.  This transitionary provision will support schemes to retain services, with the higher-than-normal turnover of participants in 2022.  Any extension under this provision must be approved by officials from the Department and consideration will be given to the impact of COVID on the recruitment of participants, services provided by schemes, along with recruitment and referral efforts.</p>  <p>  I believe that these changes will greatly support the recruitment of new CE participants and at this stage I have no plans to further review the eligibility criteria for CE participants on drug rehabilitation schemes.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

In addition to improvements in core social welfare rates, there were a number of targeted measures designed to support those most vulnerable to poverty, including increases to the Fuel Allowance and the Living Alone Allowance. As energy prices were increasing, I ensured that the increase to the Fuel Allowance rate was implemented from Budget week. I also broadened eligibility for the scheme.</p>  <p>  As a result of these targeted measures, a pensioner in receipt of Fuel Allowance, living alone, is seeing an increase of &euro;13 per week during the fuel season due to measures introduced in Budget 2022.</p>  <p>  Research shows that these types of targeted measures are effective at protecting the most vulnerable social welfare recipients. </p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices. To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government announced additional expenditure measures in February, costing in excess of a half a billion Euro, which will have a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.</p>  <p>  These measures include an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125, which has been paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment. This lump sum payment is intended to target the most vulnerable pensioners, as well as other social welfare recipients, to ensure that they are protected against rising fuel costs.</p>  <p>  This payment, in addition to the Budget increase to the Fuel Allowance rate, means that low-income households will ee an increase of 41% in fuel allowance payments this season when compared to the last season.</p>  <p>  While not all pensioners will benefit from the lump sum payment, every household in the State will receive an Energy Credit of &euro;200 which will to be applied to electricity bills.</p>  <p>  The Government has also introduced a further tax measure, to immediately reduce the cost of fuels for families and businesses. Excise duty has been reduced by 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent per litre of diesel. There has also been a reduction of 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil. These reductions will remain in place until the 31st of August 2022.</p>  <p>  Providing a &euro;15 increase in pension age payments is estimated to cost over &euro;535 million in a full year, based on the estimated average number of recipients in 2022. As such, any increase would need to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context. </p></reply>

An urgent needs payment (UNP) may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time. Government has provided &euro;45.75 million for the exceptional and urgent needs schemes in 2022.</p><p>The scheme is demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. The number of ENPs and UNPs paid by county for 2019 to 2021 is set out in the table below.</p><p>While statistics are maintained on the number of payments made under the scheme, unfortunately it is not possible to identify payments made to persons requesting assistance with hearing costs. Statistics are not maintained on the number of applications refused, including over the period 2019 to 2021. My Department is currently compiling more extensive statistics in relation to the number of applications made to the SWA schemes in 2022.  </p><p>I would encourage any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an exceptional or urgent needs payment to contact the Community Welfare Service at their local Intreo Centre.  There is a national Income Support Helpline in place - 0818-800024 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement</b></p><p><b>Number of ENPs and UNPs paid by county for 2019 - 2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>COUNTY</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CARLOW</td>       <td>850</td>       <td>754</td>       <td>682</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CAVAN</td>       <td>808</td>       <td>589</td>       <td>565</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CLARE</td>       <td>2,494</td>       <td>1,777</td>       <td>1,271</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CORK</td>       <td>8,991</td>       <td>5,385</td>       <td>4,164</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DONEGAL</td>       <td>1,865</td>       <td>1,356</td>       <td>1,397</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>DUBLIN</td>       <td>28,805</td>       <td>22,525</td>       <td>19,058</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>GALWAY</td>       <td>2,549</td>       <td>1,825</td>       <td>1,477</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>KERRY</td>       <td>3,040</td>       <td>1,970</td>       <td>1,497</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>KILDARE</td>       <td>3,447</td>       <td>2,931</td>       <td>2,365</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>KILKENNY</td>       <td>1,376</td>       <td>1,055</td>       <td>952</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LAOIS</td>       <td>3,473</td>       <td>2,169</td>       <td>1,585</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LEITRIM</td>       <td>764</td>       <td>850</td>       <td>710</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LIMERICK</td>       <td>3,342</td>       <td>2,530</td>       <td>2,197</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LONGFORD</td>       <td>1,394</td>       <td>1,227</td>       <td>1080</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>LOUTH</td>       <td>1,780</td>       <td>1,457</td>       <td>1,454</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MAYO</td>       <td>2,788</td>       <td>1,722</td>       <td>1044</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MEATH</td>       <td>3,614</td>       <td>2,350</td>       <td>2,327</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MONAGHAN</td>       <td>1,219</td>       <td>993</td>       <td>558</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>OFFALY</td>       <td>1,156</td>       <td>1,026</td>       <td>852</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ROSCOMMON</td>       <td>1,742</td>       <td>874</td>       <td>837</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SLIGO</td>       <td>1,914</td>       <td>924</td>       <td>1083</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TIPPERARY</td>       <td>3,854</td>       <td>2,958</td>       <td>2,465</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WATERFORD</td>       <td>2,930</td>       <td>2,201</td>       <td>1,337</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WESTMEATH</td>       <td>3,503</td>       <td>2,185</td>       <td>1,701</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WEXFORD</td>       <td>1,172</td>       <td>882</td>       <td>761</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>WICKLOW</td>       <td>3,328</td>       <td>3,074</td>       <td>2,133</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>92,198</td>       <td>67,589</td>       <td>55,552</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Entitlement to such benefits is dependent on the individual's social insurance contribution record, the class of social insurance paid as well as satisfying other qualification criteria relevant to the scheme being applied for. </p><p>In general, self-employed people make PRSI contributions at class S.  Where all qualification criteria for the particular scheme are satisfied, this class of PRSI gives access to the following benefits: </p><p>- Adoptive Benefit, </p><p>- Guardian's Payment (Contributory),</p><p>- Invalidity Pension,</p><p>- Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed),</p><p>- Maternity Benefit,</p><p>- Parent's Benefit,</p><p>- Partial Capacity Benefit (where in receipt of Invalidity Pension),  </p><p>- Paternity Benefit,</p><p>- State Pension (Contributory),</p><p>- Treatment Benefit, and</p><p>- Widows, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension.</p><p>The benefits to which class S PRSI does not provide access are - </p><p>-Carer's Benefit,</p><p>- Health and Safety Benefit, </p><p>- Illness Benefit, and</p><p>- Occupational Injuries Benefits. </p><p>Although self-employed people are not usually eligible for Illness Benefit, an exception was made in relation to Covid-19, primarily as a public health measure.  The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  It has been available to the self-employed since its introduction in March 2020.  Expenditure on the enhanced Illness Benefit was &euro;106 million in 2021.</p><p>There has been an extensive expansion of access to the range of social insurance benefits for self-employed social insurance contributors in recent years without any increase in the 4% rate of contribution made by them. In effect, self-employed contributors, in return for a contribution of 11 percentage points lower than the combined employer and employee contribution of 15.05% made in respect of employed contributors, have access to benefits which comprise over 90% of the value of all benefits available to employed contributors.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to giving consideration to increasing all classes of PRSI over time to replenish the Social Insurance Fund to help pay for measures and changes to be agreed including to the State pension system, improvements in short-term sick pay benefits, parental leave benefits, pay-related jobseeker's benefit and treatment benefits. </p><p>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. Supports provided under the scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single exceptional needs payments and urgent needs payments. The basic supplementary welfare allowance provides immediate assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  My Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020. </p>  <p>  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type and who are covered by Pay Related Social Insurance contributions.</p>  <p>  In March 2020, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. This enhanced Illness Benefit, however, is a temporary measure that has been extended until the end of June.  &euro;106 million was spend on the enhanced Illness Benefit in 2021.</p>  <p>  Enhanced Illness Benefit is payable for 7 days where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.  The measures were designed to limit the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to avoid extreme pressure on the health system. </p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period but for a maximum of two years, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility. Additional payments may be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.</p>  <p>  Where a person becomes permanently incapable of work due to their illness, they can apply for long-term payments.  Disability Allowance is a means-tested payment and Invalidity Pension is based on a person's social insurance record.  Secondary benefits may also be payable if people meet the eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department also provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for Illness Benefit.  My Department may also make an exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.     </p>  <p>  My Department keeps the range of income supports under review in order to make sure they meet their objectives.  Any changes to the current system would need to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government has announced additional expenditure measures to a total of over half a billion which will make a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.</p>  <p>  As part of these measures, I was delighted to announce an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 that was paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment.  It is expected that this additional lump sum will cost an estimated &euro;49 million.</p>  <p>  Other significant measures announced by the Government include the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment which is a key measure being developed by the Government to help mitigate the effects of the recent rise in electricity prices.  The scheme, under the auspices of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and supervised by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, will be paid in addition to the gas and electricity element of the HHB package to qualifying households.  Approximately 2.1m households will benefit by &euro;200 each from the new scheme.</p>  <p>  The combined worth of the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment and the additional fuel lumpsum payment is &euro;325 or the equivalent of nearly 10 weeks of additional fuel allowance or over 9 months of additional HHB payments.  I have also announced that the Working Family Payment budget increase announced on Budget Day will be brought forward from the first of June to the first of April.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, due to the continuing rise in inflation and as part of the economic consequences of the tragic conflict in Ukraine, the Government recently reduced excise duty on fuel.</p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department also provides Exceptional Needs Payments which may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Where a person is not eligible for the Rent Supplement scheme, they are referred to their local housing authority to have their housing needs assessed and, if successful, will be placed on the housing list.</p>  <p>  The Government recognised the challenges of rising prices last October in Budget 2022 when we brought in a package of tax and social welfare measures worth over &euro;1 billion. Last month, the Government agreed a further package of &euro;505 million, including the &euro;200 energy credit and a lump sum payment of &euro;125 for those in receipt of the fuel allowance. This month the Government brought in a further tax measure, to immediately reduce the cost of fuels for families and businesses.</p>  <p>  The Working Family Payment is an in-work support which provides an income top-up for employees on low earnings with children.  It is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment. In Budget 2022 I provided for a &euro;10 weekly increase in the Working Family Payment income limits for families of all sizes.  I am pleased that this measure will now come into effect from April 2022 as part of the Government's response to cost of living increases.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I increased the rates for a qualified child aged under 12 by &euro;2 to &euro;40 per week, and for a qualified child aged 12 or older by &euro;3 to &euro;48 per week, from January. I also increased the level of the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance by &euro;10 to &euro;160 for each child aged 4 to 11 years and to &euro;285 for each child aged 12 and over. I also equalised the income limits for one and two parent households, thereby making it easier for lone parents to qualify for that payment. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Each application will be reviewed and payments will based on the scheme as agreed with unions.  In this context and  given the details available at this time, it is difficult to comment on the specific case or examples raised by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  Generally, under the terms of this settlement, on reaching retirement age, eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex-gratia payment in respect of time employed by CE schemes since 2008.  People who retired since 2008 and who have reached retirement age will be able to apply for payments immediately when the scheme is in place. CE supervisors and assistant supervisors who retire on ill health grounds can also apply for the payment subject to the provision of supporting documents and medical evidence. </p>  <p>  The ex-gratia payment provides for 2 weeks pay per year of service or part thereof in the qualifying period.  The calculation will be based on the salary point of the CE supervisor or CE assistant supervisor on the date of retirement, subject to a cap of &euro;600 per week.</p>  <p>  The qualifying period for the scheme is from 1st July 2008 to 31st December 2023 and will apply to all periods of employment as a CE supervisor or CE assistant supervisor during that period subject to certain conditions.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection is currently working on the administrative arrangements to implement the agreed settlement so that payments will issue to qualified CE workers in 2022. </p>  <p>  I trust that clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

We know that starting work in difficult economic conditions can have a scarring effect on a young person&rsquo;s future work trajectory.  Many of the sectors which were most affected by the public health restrictions were those that tend to employ more young workers, such as the hospitality and retail sectors. </p><p>Thankfully there has been a strong exit from unemployment with returns to employment as the economy has re-opened in recent months.</p><p>Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate for 2019 averaged approximately 12.5 percent. At its peak in May 2020, the Covid-adjusted unemployment rate for people under the age of 25 was 70 percent. This has fallen substantially, to around 13 percent as of February 2022, or 12.6 percent according to the traditional seasonally adjusted measure. </p><p>There are, as of the week ending the 13<sup>th</sup>of March, 21,362 people under the age of 25 in receipt of income supports. This is comprised of 4,809 PUP recipients and 16,553 people on the Live Register. This is equivalent to 10.2 percent of all PUP and Live Register recipients. This compares with the peak, November 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2020, when under 25s made up 20.5 percent of all PUP and Live Register recipients, though, at this time, students were eligible for PUP support. </p><p>The significant decline in recipients is a consequence of the removal of public health restrictions and the well performing labour market.  </p><p>While there has been a welcome reduction in unemployment for young people, the Government has ensured that there are significant provisions to support young people who were adversely impacted by the pandemic, and those who were already experiencing disadvantage before the pandemic.  </p><p>In July 2021, the Government launched Pathways to Work 2021 &ndash; 2025, the national employment services strategy. The strategy aims to increase the capacity and effectiveness of Public Employment Services in a post-pandemic labour market and to support people transition into employment. </p><p>The Pathways to Work Strategy includes the following supports to help young people: </p><p>- Ring-fenced positions for young people on the Work Placement Experience Programme;</p><p>- Additional Community Employment and T&uacute;s places for young people;</p><p>- Providing 50,000 further education and training places;</p><p>- Increased places on the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy- with the subsidy being available, on an earlier basis than normal, to employers when they recruit young people.; and,</p><p>- Targeting 10,000 apprentice registrations per year by 2025.</p></reply>

The applicant must be suffering from an injury, disease, congenital deformity or physical or mental illness or defect, which has lasted for one year or is expected to last for one year and as a result of which, they are substantially restricted in undertaking work which would otherwise be suitable having regard to the person&rsquo;s age, experience and qualifications. The person must also satisfy a means test and be habitually resident in the State.  </p>  <p>  The DA scheme is structured to encourage recipients to avail of opportunities to engage in either insurable employment or self-employment. When an individual engages in either, they can avail of an income disregard of 100% of the first &euro;140 earned per week, and 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 are also disregarded, for the purpose of the means test. The upper earnings disregard figure is increasing to &euro;375 in June 2022. Any amounts over the upper disregard figure are assessed in full. This disregard is available to all DA recipients who engage in employment and there are no restrictions on the hours worked each week.</p>  <p>  Under the make work pay (MWP) initiative where a DA recipient is assessed as having means in excess of the threshold after the disregard is applied to their earnings, they are entitled to retain their free travel (FT) pass for five years. My Department has also put in place a system for the fast-track reinstatement of DA to people with disabilities who have taken up or returned to an employment which subsequently did not work out within 12 months.</p>  <p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

Within this context, officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform held discussions on proposals to progress and resolve this complex issue, while having regard to the wider budgetary framework.  Department officials also held discussions with unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.</p>  <p>  Following extensive discussions, between the relevant Departments and union officials, a  proposal was brought to both unions, which was then voted on by union members.  On the 23rd December, both unions involved confirmed acceptance of this settlement with specific terms which will benefit over 2,200 people employed by CE schemes going back to 2008. It is estimated to have a total cost of over &euro;24 million.</p>  <p>  The terms of this agreement are binding and there is no appeal process; as this proposal has been voted on, accepted and agreed.  The agreement resolves this long-standing issue through the payment of a once off ex-gratia payment to eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  </p>  <p>  CE Supervisors and assistant supervisors will apply directly to the ex-gratia scheme once the process for doing so has been established. Each application will be reviewed and payments will based on the specific terms of the scheme as agreed with unions.  </p>  <p>  Generally, under the terms of this settlement, on reaching retirement age, eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex-gratia payment in respect of time employed by CE schemes since 2008.  People who retired since 2008 and who have reached retirement age will be able to apply for payments immediately when the scheme is in place.</p>  <p>  The qualifying period for the scheme is from 1st July 2008 to 31st December 2023 and will apply to all periods of employment as a CE supervisor or CE assistant supervisor during that period subject to certain conditions.</p>  <p>  The ex-gratia payment provides for 2 weeks pay per year of service or part thereof in the qualifying period.  The calculation will be based on the salary point of the CE supervisor or CE assistant supervisor on the date of retirement, subject to a cap of &euro;600 per week.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection is currently working on the administrative arrangements including any review mechanisms that may be available to implement the agreed settlement so that payments will issue to qualified CE workers in 2022.</p>  <p>  i trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In most cases, these payments can be made until the child reaches age 18 or until the child reaches age 22 where they are engaged in full-time education. This is the position with regard to Guardian's Payment, whether contributory or non-contributory, to which the Deputy refers, as well as other payments such as Increases for a Qualified Child which can be paid with a range of social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  Full-time education is defined in Regulations for this purpose. For someone to be considered in full-time education requires their attendance at a course of full-time instruction, on a full-time basis, by day, at an institution of education. With the exception of Youthreach, courses provided by Solas which attract an allowance are not included in the definition. Similarly, courses which form part of an employment or work experience programme, which arise from employment, or which include an extensive period of work experience are also not included in this definition.</p>  <p>  An apprenticeship is a training and education programme, which mixes learning in a college or training institution with work-based learning in a company. At least half of apprenticeship learning is done on the job. To become an apprentice in Ireland a person has to be hired by an employer. As an apprentice, a person will have a formal employment contract, and they will be paid a salary during their apprenticeship training. </p>  <p>  An apprentice is in quite a different position to a person covered by the current definition of "full-time education". The current arrangements ensure that support is targeted at those parents whose children are not in a position to earn their own income due to the fact of being engaged in full time education and recognise that those parents are likely to continue to incur costs in light of their child's continuing education. There are no plans to change the definition full-time education as proposed by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is the overarching disability employment policy initiative in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Employment contributes significantly to the capacity of people with disabilities to live independently and the CES takes a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to employment of all persons with disabilities. The CES&rsquo;s strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide co-ordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers.</p>  <p>  My Department has responsibility for a number of specific actions under the CES that are aimed at raising awareness amongst employers and providing support to them in employing people with disabilities. To this end, my Department have funded the establishment of a disability information service for employers run by the Open Doors Initiative. This service &lsquo;Employers for Change: A Disability Information Service&rsquo; provides expert peer source of advice and information on employing staff with disabilities, with a view to enhancing the confidence and competence of individual employers to employ, manage and retain staff with disabilities. This is complemented by a range of actions under the Strategy being led by differing Department and Agencies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-22a.1822.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032200083#WRCC04200"><p>Many early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) services report staffing challenges, as a result of difficulties in both recruitment and retention of staff. In general, staffing pressures in the sector are caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of staff turnover, compounded more recently by high numbers of COVID-19 cases. Recruitment and staff retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to poor terms and conditions, with for example the average pay for non-managerial staff being &euro;12.60 per hour in 2021. </p>  <p>  The current number of qualified early years educators who are available to be recruited is not known. The figure depends on the number of individuals who have achieved a qualification at Level 5 or higher (on the National Framework of Qualifications) in Early Childhood Care and Education over many years, or a qualification recognised as equivalent, their current employment status (whether inside or outside the ELC/SAC sector), as well as the current employment status of qualified staff who have previously left the sector but could return. In addition, some ELC/SAC services recruit qualified staff from outside Ireland. It should also be noted that there is no qualification requirement to work in SAC, and so the potential pool of people who could work in SAC is much larger.</p>  <p>  Data on yearly enrolments and graduation in further and higher education institutions is a matter for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. However, published data from QQI indicates that 1,728 students were awarded a level 5 qualification in Early Childhood Care and Education in 2021, while 1,517 students graduated with a level 6 award. In addition, many of those completing relevant degrees (at levels 7 and 8) are also qualifying to work in the sector for the first time.  </p>  <p>  Statistics on the turnover rate of staff in the ELC / SAC sector are gathered through the Annual Early Years Sector Profile. The most recent published report, for 2019/2020, indicates the annual staff turnover rate in 2020 was 18%, which was down five percentage points on the previous year&rsquo;s figure of 23%. Data on staff turnover in the sector in 2021 will be available with the publication of the 2020/21 Annual Early Years Sector Profile, which I expect to publish in the coming weeks. It should be noted that data on staff turnover includes both those who leave the sector and those who move from one service to another but remain working in the sector - in 2019/20, of those leaving a service, 22% were reported to have gone to another service, and the destination of 13% was unknown.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the State is not the employer, and my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff in the sector. However, I am doing all that is in my power to address the issue.</p>  <p>  I began a process in December 2020, which examined the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee, which began meeting in December 2021. In Budget 2022, I announced a new Core Funding stream which, among other objectives, will support service providers to meet new higher rates of pay that may be negotiated through the Joint Labour Committee. </p>  <p>  Also, in December 2021, I launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028, which aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare, and includes actions to support staff recruitment and retention and to raise the profile of careers in the sector.  </p></reply>

Across all of Government, a wide range of specific and targeted policy approaches, designed in consultation with Traveller and Roma community representatives, are in place to seek those improved outcomes and encourage much greater inclusion across all of Irish society.</p>  <p>  The recommendations contained in the Report of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Key Issues Affecting the Traveller Community will  inform the next iteration of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy.  I am leading on this strategy and the support of all Government Departments will be crucial in ensuring the successor strategy will have a more outcomes focused approach. </p>  <p>  I engaged with the Joint Oireachtas Committee before publication of their report in November 2021.</p>  <p>  Review of NTRIS and development of successor strategy</p>  <p>  With regard to the recommendations pertaining to my Department, you will be aware that the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) provides a framework for action on Traveller and Roma issues.  It represents a whole of Government approach and brings Government Departments and Agencies together with representatives of Traveller and Roma communities to focus on key issues in a structured I chair the NTRIS Steering Committee.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to a review of the Strategy and I will work with stakeholders to reviewing what has been achieved, and to developing new approaches, as necessary, with a particular focus on implementation and measurement. Proposals for an evaluation of the processes for implementation of three equality strategies - the Migrant Integration Strategy, the National Strategy for Women and Girls and NTRIS, which all concluded last year, have been sought. It is expected that the contract will be signed very shortly with work commencing in March and concluding in quarter three this year.</p>  <p>  The reason for proceeding with an evaluation process that spans a number of equality strategies is to place the focus on implementation and to identify potential good practice in some areas that can be transferred to others.  The objectives of our equality strategies remain largely relevant and the key challenge is to ensure better delivery.  The issue of intersectionality also needs to be addressed in a more coherent manner.  </p>  <p>  The current NTRIS Steering Committee is remaining in operation during the Review process and our next meeting is scheduled for the end of March.  Work will continue on implementing NTRIS&rsquo;s actions, many of which remain highly relevant.   </p>  <p>  The Strategy Committee&rsquo;s role will also be pivotal in developing the consultation process and the content for the successor strategy. The advice provided by Traveller and Roma organisations will directly shape the scope and focus of the next strategy. </p>  <p>  Early learning and Care Services</p>  <p>  With regard to the recommendations that relate to the early years sector, my Department will consider approaches to informing and supporting enhanced participation of Traveller and Roma children in Early Learning and Care services.   </p>  <p>  First 5 commits to the introduction of a DEIS-type model for Early Learning and Care settings to create further opportunities to narrow the gap for disadvantaged children including those from Traveller and Roma communities and we will be working on the design and development of this model.</p>  <p>  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) is available for all children including Traveller and Roma children with additional needs.  The AIM model seeks to create a more inclusive environment in pre-schools, so all children, regardless of ability, can benefit from quality early learning and care. The model achieves this by providing universal supports to pre-school settings, and targeted supports, which focus on the needs of the individual child, without requiring a diagnosis of disability.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion training.  This training aims to foster awareness regarding equality, diversity and inclusion. It seeks to encourage and support those working in the Early Learning &amp;amp; Care (ELC) sector to actively advocate for the inclusion of all children and their families within the ELC setting. </p>  <p>  Employment</p>  <p>  Employment is an ongoing challenge in the Traveller and Roma community.  In the development of the successor strategy to NTRIS, my Department will work with the NTRIS employment subgroup, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in developing an action plan for Traveller employment.</p>  <p>  Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty</p>  <p>  Finally, as you will be aware, the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty is a legal obligation on all public bodies to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and plans. Furthermore, a public body is required to report annually on developments and achievements in regard to the equality and human rights issues and actions, in a manner accessible to the public, in its annual report.

The IPAS Critical Incident Policy ensures that any death that occurs within accommodation centres provided by the Department is referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a matter of course.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na then refer all deaths to the local Coroner&rsquo;s office. Residents and centre staff are provided with the necessary supports during this difficult time. The Department does not comment on individual cases.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, IPAS has also developed a new policy on recording and reporting of deaths of residents which sets out the procedures to be followed by its staff and by centre managers when notified of the death of a person who is resident in IPAS accommodation. This is in parallel with the IPAS critical incident policy. </p>  <p>  The policy has been in operation since June 2021. This policy is intended to balance the need for openness and transparency in all State organisations in the provision of information to the public, with the expectation of privacy and consideration of the sensitive nature surrounding the death of any individual for their family and friends. </p>  <p>  In the case of international protection applicants, regard must also be had for the legal obligation to protect the anonymity of international protection applicants during the protection process. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, work is ongoing to implement the new model of accommodation foreseen in the White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service.  The current focus is on acquiring Phase Two accommodation and on getting Approved Housing Bodies to acquire and manage Phase Two properties.  These are the properties to which applicants for international protection will move after their first four months in international protection accommodation.</p></reply>

It was originally announced in Budget 2022 and is informed by recommendations of an Expert Group to design a new funding model for the sector that were adopted by Government in December. </p><p>Core Funding marks a new departure in State funding of the sector and is a significant step towards ensuring high-quality, affordable, sustainable and accessible services. It will operate from September 2022 to support improved quality, affordability, and sustainability in ELC and SAC.</p><p>Core Funding will be available to registered ELC and SAC providers, including full day care providers, ECCE-only providers, and stand-alone school-age providers, subject to the service agreeing to come into contract for the scheme. It will be a payment directly to services who choose to participate in the scheme.</p><p>The total available budget for Core Funding is equivalent to &euro;221 million in a full programme year, contingent on an Employment Regulation Order being agreed by the Joint Labour Committee. Core Funding will be allocated to services based on their capacity and the qualifications of those working in a service.  The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity. </p><p>Additionally, a further &euro;38 million will be distributed to services with ELC graduate Lead Educators/Managers through the ELC Graduate Premium. In order for a service to be allocated an ELC Graduate Premium, the person in question must be a Lead Educator in an ELC room and/or the Centre Manager of an ELC or a combined ELC and SAC service and must hold an appropriate qualification as per the Department&rsquo;s Higher Capitation Qualifications list. They must also have a minimum of three years&rsquo; experience in the sector. The ELC Graduate Premium is calculated based on the number of hours of provision led by ELC graduate; and if the ELC or combined ELC and SAC service has an ELC graduate as the Manager.</p><p>A service's allocation will therefore be calculated in line with the following three elements</p><p><b>1. Main Base Rate</b></p><p>Number of child places in an age group multiplied by value based on ratio that applies to age group in table multiplied by hours of operation per week multiplied by weeks open per year <table>    <tr>       <th>Age of child </th>       <th>Value of Core Funding per place per hour </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Full-time (5+ hours per day) and Part-time (3.5 hours &ndash; 5 hours per day)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>0-1 year of age</td>       <td>&euro;1.66 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1-2 years of age</td>       <td>&euro;1.07 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2-3 years of age</td>       <td>&euro;0.92 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3-6 years of age</td>       <td>&euro;0.68 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Sessional (up to 3.5 hours per day)</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>0-1 year of age</td>       <td>&euro;1.66 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1-2.5 years of age</td>       <td>&euro;1.07 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2.5-6 years of age</td>       <td>&euro;0.65 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>School-age</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4-15 years of age</td>       <td>&euro;0.55 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>2. Graduate Lead Educator Premium</b></p><p>Number of rooms led by a graduate multiplied by hours per week multiplied by weeks open per year multiplied by Graduate Lead Educator premium rate of &euro;4.44, with a maximum of one Graduate Lead Educator premium per ELC room.</p><p><b>3. Graduate Manager Premium</b></p><p>Hours of operation per week multiplied by weeks per year the service operates multiplied by Graduate Manager premium rate of &euro;4.44, with a maximum of one Graduate Manager premium per service.</p><p>The structure of Core Funding is based on the recommendations of the Expert Group outlined in Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children's attendance. </p><p>Core Funding is designed to operate alongside the existing funding schemes, including the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). Therefore, the NCS will continue to provide subsidies for children in attendance and ECCE will continue to provide capitation.</p><p>Services will be required to offer the NCS and/or the ECCE programme to all eligible children/parents, in line with their operations, and will be invited to report on the quality development measures they are pursuing.</p><p>A Ready Reckoner to support services to determine the potential value of Core Funding to their service is available at earlyyearshive.ncs.gov.ie/ReadyReckoner/. </p><p>Participation in Core Funding for ELC and SAC providers will require a commitment not to increase fees to parents from September 2021 rates in return for the increased State funding. This feature of the scheme will ensure that parents feel the affordability benefits of the NCS and ECCE, including the full effects of the NCS reforms announced in Budget 2022 .</p><p>Budget 2022 also announced a once-off Transition Fund which will be available to ELC and SAC services from May to August inclusive, during the period between the ending of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) in April and the introduction of a new Core Funding stream in September. The primary conditionality of the Transition Fund is that fees to parents do not increase above September 2021 levels. </p><p>The introduction of fee management measures is one of the recommendations of the Expert Group, as approved by Government. Fee management will start with a requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access the new Core Funding scheme and Transition Fund, as outlined above. Further information on proposed fee management mechanisms in the longer term is available in the Group's report, available at: first5fundingmodel.gov.ie </p><p>Providers who have increased their fees above September 2021 levels will be required to revert to September 2021 levels before May 2022 to be eligible for the Transition Fund in May 2022. Similarly, to be eligible for the new Core Funding stream, providers who have increased their fees above September 2021 levels will be required to revert to September 2021 levels before September 2022. </p><p>These measures were announced as part of the Budget in October 2021, meaning that services did not have the opportunity to raise their fees in advance of the reference period for the fee freeze after the announcement.</p><p>Budget 2022 also confirmed that ELC and SAC employers will continue to benefit from the exemption to the turnover rule for the EWSS until April 2022, in part to avoid the additional costs arising from public health measures being passed on to parents.  </p><p>The EWSS has been available to employers in the sector since August 2020.  Enhanced EWSS rates (from October 2020-January 2022) amount to approximately &euro;34 million per month for the sector, covering on average 80% of payroll costs and 50% of total operating costs for providers.  Standard EWSS (from August 2020-October 2020 and for February 2022) amount to approximately &euro;22 million per month for the sector, covering on average 50% of payroll costs and 38% of total operating costs for providers. A new EWSS flat rate of &euro;100 that will apply from March-April 2022 will amount to approximately &euro;11 million per month for the sector, covering on average, 25% staff costs or 11% total operating costs. </p><p>Given the level of investment being made available to the sector through EWSS, it is difficult to see any justification for an increase in fees at this time.</p><p>‎‎Sustainability Funding also continues to be available to providers where there are sustainability difficulties and I have requested that providers would exhaust this route before considering increases in fees for parents. I encourage providers to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee if they require any further information or support. </p><p>Core Funding is part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to realising the First 5 target of investment of approximately &euro;1 billion by 2028. Core Funding introduces a strategic way of funding the sector and begins to implement the recommendations of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model. </p></reply>

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax.  </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.</p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised fostering allowance.  Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager.   Each application for an additional payment will be accompanied by supporting documentation evidencing the need.</p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs.  </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.</p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs.</p>  <p>  Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation. Through this consultation, foster carers highlighted the need for the foster care allowance to be reviewed in light of inflation and increases in social welfare allowances. Tusla is currently preparing a paper on this matter. </p>  <p>   The rate of the foster care allowance is kept under review by officials within the Department and at present there are no plans to change the rate.

More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p><p>To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme. Through this Annual Programme, priority has been attached to, inter alia, the creation of places for children under 3.</p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p><p>Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early earning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21% and the vacancy rates for all age groups having risen significantly compared to two years ago. <table>    <tr>       <th>National Vacancy Rate By Age (June 2021)</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Up to 1 year (0-12 months)</td>       <td>20% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 year+ to 2 years (13-24 months)</td>       <td>10% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 years+ to 3 years (25-36 months)</td>       <td>17% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 years+ to 4 years (37-48 months)</td>       <td>17% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months) Non-School-Going</td>       <td>12% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months) School-Going</td>       <td>42% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months) Non-school going</td>       <td>30% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months) School going</td>       <td>48% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 years+ to 8 years (73-96 months)</td>       <td>37% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8 years+</td>       <td>34% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>21% </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department is continuing to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, particularly in light of the recent lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>Pobal has, using the data captured in June 2021 and current registration data, recently projected vacancy rates in February 2022. While this analysis shows a fall in vacancy rates from June 2021 to February 2022 &ndash; with vacancy rates falling from 21% to 19%, this analysis suggests that there is unused capacity across the country. Further analysis is being undertaken by Pobal to establish if this unused capacity varies by type of provision or location, to establish the degree of mismatch is supply and demand for certain cohorts or children or in certain areas.</p><p>Pobal will also commence new data collection in April 2022, as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey. This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established.</p><p>In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery so, for example, greater funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings.</p><p>Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance.

A further &euro;2.2m was secured in capital carryover bringing total capital funding available to &euro;10.5m in 2021. The upgrading of the fire safety measures in existing early learning and childcare services was the key objective of the 2021 Capital Programme, with &euro;10.5 million available funding.</p>  <p>  During 2021, my Department successfully secured &euro;70m in the revised National Development Plan (NDP) allocation. This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during 2023-2025.  Investment under the NDP will consist of three pillars: Modernisation, New Capacity and First 5 Initiatives. This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:</p>  <p>  (1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.</p>  <p>  (2) New Capacity: Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase. In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.</p>  <p>  (3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Capital funding has been reduced in 2022 to &euro;0.5m as my Department focusses on the preparation of distribution of NDP funding from 2023 onwards.

The evidence suggests children achieve better outcomes when staff are well qualified. This is undisputed internationally. First 5 seeks to continue to build an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce, and includes a commitment to achieve a graduate-led workforce by 2028. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2022 I announced the introduction of a new Core Funding stream from September 2022. Core Funding has a number of objectives, including to support improved quality, affordability, sustainability and the achievement of the commitment to a graduate-led workforce. Of the total of &euro;221m in full year costs, &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. This aspect of Core Funding will encourage employment of graduates as Lead Educators across all ELC, not just in ECCE rooms as was the case with Higher Capitation payments.</p>  <p>  In December last year, I launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare.  </p>  <p>  In particular, Nurturing Skills commits to the provision of funded places on flexible education programmes at levels 6 to 8 for current early years educators. This new funding will support upskilling and strengthen career development pathways for those working in the sector, reducing the cost to educators of undertaking further and higher education qualifications. The new funding scheme will also develop and introduce mechanisms for providing financial support to early learning and care services to help meet the costs of releasing staff to go on student practice placements and study leave. Plans for the new funding scheme are currently being developed. </p>  <p>  This planned new funding for educators to upskill is in addition to financial supports that are already in place for educators undertaking qualifications. Existing financial supports include the Free Fees Initiative. My Department has since 2014 provided a number of rounds of funding for early years educators to undertake qualifications through the Learner Fund.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-22a.1939.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032200085#WREE01300"><p>ECCE is a universal programme which provides 2 years of free pre-school to children in the eligible age range of 2 years and 8 months to 5 years and 6 months.  ECCE is not mandatory but has a very high take up rate with 95% of children in the eligible age range attending ECCE services.  </p>  <p>  ECCE is provided by private early learning and care service providers under funding agreements  with my Department. There are currently almost 4, 000 providers contracted to provide ECCE throughout the country.</p>  <p>   Under the new funding stream, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase, providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures which includes staff costs. Core Funding will also contribute to cost increases related to non-staff costs (for example, utilities, rent).</p>  <p>  Core Funding is equivalent to an increase of at least 14% on the standard capitation for ECCE. At a minimum, for every ECCE child &euro;78.75 per week will be available from ECCE and Core Funding, compared to &euro;69 in ECCE standard capitation only. Because Core Funding is paid in respect of places rather than children, effectively this could mean a greater &lsquo;per child&rsquo; marginal increase if the service has unfilled capacity. For example, with an ECCE occupancy of 9 children per staff member, Core Funding and ECCE together will be equivalent to weekly per child capitation of &euro;80.92.</p>  <p>  Core Funding replaces the ECCE Higher Capitation payment which is pays a higher capitation rate of &euro;80.25 for all children attending ECCE classes with a graduate ECCE room lead.  Core Funding includes a new a graduate premium which will be to be paid to services with graduate room leads for all  early learning and care age groups.   </p>  <p>  A small number of services, estimated to be approximately 50 in total or 1% of all providers, would receive less under Core Funding than they  received in Higher Capitation payments. For this small number of providers, I have issued a funding guarantee whereby, under Core Funding providers will receive the same level of funding as they received from ECCE Higher Capitation, assuming the numbers of children, graduate staff and type of service offered remains the same in the 2022/23 programme year as in 2021/22.  Services for whom the Funding Guarantee will apply are higher capitation ECCE services with large groups and high occupancy that are currently in receipt of the highest levels of public funding relative to the staffing levels required for operating those types of services.  </p>  <p>  With regard to staffing difficulties in the ELC sector, I acknowledge that early learning and care and school-age childcare services can experience staffing and recruitment difficulties and I have committed to supporting service providers in their efforts in recruiting qualified staff.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the State is not the employer, and my Department does not set wage levels nor determine working conditions for staff in the sector. However, I am doing all that is in my power to address the issue.</p>  <p>  On 7 December 2021, I launched Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028, which aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. There is no differentiation in Nurturing Skills for the different types of service providers.  The plan aims to make improvements for staff in all services, full time or sessional.  In additional, a Joint Labour Committee is currently meeting to set pay scales for the sector which, if agreed, will be set out in an Employment Regulation Order.  Together these initiatives will improve staff retention in the sector.</p>  <p>  Finally, my Department has recently commenced a review of the ECCE programme to assess the value of the programme and to identify potential improvements.  ECCE providers, parents, children and stakeholders will be invited to contribute to the review later this year.  </p></reply>

I intend to bring the legislative proposals in respect of the Payment Scheme to Government for formal approval very soon. As previously stated, I will seek priority drafting of the Bill to ensure that it can be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible, subject also to any pre-legislative scrutiny process which may take place. </p><p>Once the legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas and the administrative infrastructure required to deliver the Scheme has been established, the Scheme will be open for applications for both financial awards and enhanced medical cards. I hope that this will be possible by the end of 2022.</p><p>It is intended that the form of enhanced medical card will ensure the provision, without charge, of the following primary and community health services for those eligible: </p><p>- GP services; </p><p>- prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances; </p><p>- dental, ophthalmic and aural services; </p><p>- home nursing; </p><p>- home support; </p><p>- chiropody/podiatry; and </p><p>- physiotherapy.</p><p>As well as the above health services, it is intended that cardholders are not be required to pay (i) the &euro;100 Emergency Department statutory charge or (ii) the &euro;80 public hospital statutory charge. </p><p>Those who are living outside of Ireland will have the choice of of opting for an enhanced medical card  or a once off financial payment in lieu of the card. </p><p>Ensuring that the financial payments awarded from the Scheme do not negatively impact on survivors entitlements to other means tested supports, including medical cards, GP visit cards and nursing home supports, is very important. My Department is working with the relevant Departments in this regard to ensure, as is the case for previous Schemes of this nature, that these awards are disregarded.</p></reply>

In addition to the Ceann Comhairle, the ad hoc group is comprised of the Cathaoirligh of the Oireachtas committees whose remit mirrors the responsibilities of the Departments to whom the recommendations were submitted as well as members of the former Joint Committee. </p>  <p>  The ad hoc Oireachtas group is seeking to make progress in 2022 on the 84 recommendations in the Final Report, including the 23 education recommendations. In this regard, I can confirm that my officials have been in correspondence with ad hoc Oireachtas group recently to update it on the progress made in the tertiary education sector.</p>  <p>  The key recommendations for the tertiary education sector include, inter alia, recommendations for: targeted financial supports; affirmative policy actions to encourage more Travellers into the teaching profession; the creation of culturally appropriate apprenticeship and internship schemes; and the development of a &ldquo;Traveller Graduate Network&rdquo;. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department is proactively progressing initiatives in all of these areas. These include: </p>  <p>  - The Student Assistance Fund is available to assist students who are unable to meet costs associated with day-to-day participation in higher education, including essential travel and childcare costs. Additional financial supports were secured under the Dormant Accounts Fund in 2021 and again in 2022 to address Covid related issues affecting Traveller progression to and retention within higher education. </p>  <p>  - The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) includes a targeted initiative aimed at increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in Initial Teacher Education. One of the projects funded under this initiative is the TOBAR project in the Marino Institute of Education/TCD Centre. The TOBAR project focuses specifically on working with members of the Irish Traveller community to access initial teacher education (ITE) on primary, post-primary and further education programmes. A separate initiative under the PATH programme is the Travellers in Education project which is being led by a consortium of higher education institutes in the southern region. One of the key outcomes from Phase 1 is in respect of a Traveller Graduate Network which is currently engaged with 26 graduates.</p>  <p>  - The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 was published last April. It has several key deliverables which are relevant to Travellers and other underrepresented groups including commitments to: include the voice of underrepresented cohorts; develop an inclusive apprenticeship access and delivery structure; and monitor and assess targets. My Department has established a National Apprenticeship Office (NAO) and the National Apprenticeship Alliance (NAA) to oversee this work. The NAA will have an equity of access sub-committee which will ensure that the voice of Travellers and other underrepresented groups are heard.</p>  <p>   I look forward to engaging with the ad hoc Oireachtas group over the coming months to progress the recommendations in the Final Report. </p></reply>

Given these interconnections, it is my intention to bring the Student grant review to Cabinet alongside the report on funding and reform of higher education. </p>  <p>  Implementing the Report recommendations is a key priority for my Department. Accordingly, I have already initiated improvements to the Student Grant Scheme for the academic year 2022/23 to allow early progress in addressing key themes emerging from the Review of SUSI, and to further alleviate the pressures arising from the recent trends in the cost of living for students and their families. These changes have been targeted at alleviating cost of living pressures for students and their families, supporting students who have to travel longer distances to their institution, recognising the need to reflect changes in income levels and expanding supports for postgraduates.</p>  <p>  The changes I made in Budget 2022, will mean that from the next academic year:-</p>  <p>  - All student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, will increase  by &euro;200 per year. </p>  <p>  - The income thresholds to  qualify for the standard rates of student grant will increase by &euro;1,000. </p>  <p>  - The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has  been reduced from 45km to 30km. This means from the commencement of the 2022/23 academic year, students who reside 30km or more from the college attended will now qualify for the higher, non-adjacent rate of grant (of up to &euro;6,115 for the non-adjacent special rate of grant for the most disadvantaged students). </p>  <p>  These changes will benefit thousands of students and will build on the improvements that have already been made through this year&rsquo;s student grant scheme.   </p>  <p>  In addition, I understand the Department of Transport have introduced a new "Youth Travel Card" as part of Budget 2022, which will offer 50% discount on fares across the public transport network for those aged 19 to 23.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. In 2020 and 2021, as part of the package of COVID supports, the Department allocated &euro;10m to an Access Funding package which resulted in the doubling of the Student Assistance Fund (&euro;8.1m) and additional funding of &euro;1.9m for other vulnerable students in line with the National Access Plan and through existing structures within HEIs.  Also in 2021, an additional &euro;1.3m was allocated to the SAF to meet the additional demands identified by the Higher Education Institutions arising from COVID19. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie. </p></reply>

These agencies are privately owned and primarily operate in other jurisdictions arranging study and travel options for prospective International Higher Education (HE) and English language education (ELE) students to many countries including Ireland. These agencies act as intermediaries between prospective students and predominantly private ELE and HE providers, who secure payments for courses and assist students with travel, accommodation, and visa requirements.  </p>  <p>  As this is principally a private sector activity and a matter of private contract between the parties involved the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science does not have a role in these matters. There is presently no national regulation of such agencies as many entities of this type are based in other jurisdictions and operate outside of the State.</p>  <p>  Education providers in Ireland wishing to recruit non-EEA students are required to be listed on the ILEP (the Interim List of Eligible Programmes - the list of education programmes considered to justify the granting of permission to students to live and work in Ireland). The ILEP is managed by the Department of Justice in conjunction with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  </p>  <p>  A condition of an ILEP listing is a requirement for education providers to operate an 'escrow' type account with a bank or financial institution regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland. Providers are required to hold funds on behalf of prospective students pending the outcome of their application for a visa. Where the visa decision is positive the funds are transferred to the provider. If the visa application is refused the funds (less any pre-agreed charges) are refunded to the student.</p>  <p>  The Government is taking further steps to strengthen the regulation of the English language sector. The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Act 2019 contains provisions to provide for the establishment of a new national Learner Protection Fund and also the International Education Mark (IEM).</p>  <p>  The new national Learner Protection Fund will be established and administered by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), the national agency with responsibility for external quality assurance and qualifications across the further, higher and adult education sectors. The fund will be used to &lsquo;teach out&rsquo; a programme in the event that a provider fails to provide a programme. Should this not be possible, the fund will be used to reimburse students for the most recent fees that have been paid.</p>  <p>  The International Education Mark (IEM) is a key component of the Irish Government&rsquo;s policy for the English language education sector and is intended to provide a quality framework for the provision of education to international learners.  To obtain the IEM providers will have to demonstrate compliance with requirements on corporate fitness, quality assurance and the protection of enrolled learners, alongside key criteria and practices surrounding the recruitment and admission of international students, information provision, student welfare, cultural awareness and academic support provisions. In addition, providers will also be required to satisfy conditions relating to the recruitment, training and the cessation of employment of staff. </p>  <p>  This Department is currently working with QQI to develop and implement the key precursor measures that are necessary to facilitate the introduction of the Learner Protection Fund and the IEM and it is the intention that substantial progress will be made on advancing this work in 2022.</p></reply>

Underpinned by strong partnership with key stakeholders, it is focused on responding flexibly to priority skill needs and to technology-driven changes in the world of work so that Ireland has a skilled and productive workforce.</p>  <p>  Under the National Skills Strategy, the skills ecosystem encompasses the National Skills Council and Regional Skills Fora and labour market information entities including the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in SOLAS and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. This response facilitates engagement, dialogue, and collaboration between relevant Government Departments and agencies, the education and training system, enterprise agencies, and private sector representatives, and informs and drives responsive and flexible forecasting, planning, and provision across all sectors of the economy. It helps to identify skills provision shortfalls to be addressed by the education and training system and concerns relating to labour shortages in particular sectors that relate to other factors.     </p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the National Economic Recovery Plan, and in partnership with the OECD, I launched a Skills Strategy Project which will play an important role in ensuring that Ireland's skills system is effective in meeting skills and human capital needs. It will be central to our economic and social sustainability against the backdrop of major trends impacting on the workforce and society including digitisation and climate transition. </p>  <p>  Apprenticeship is a demand driven educational and training programme which develops the skills of an apprentice in order to meet industry and labour market needs. Consequently, the number of apprentices being registered is determined by employers in the sector. The development of new apprenticeships is also employer-led and it is open to employers to work with education and training providers to develop new apprenticeships if there is sufficient demand from the sector.  Further details can be found on www.apprenticeship.ie.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025&rsquo; aims to ensure that the apprenticeship system will contribute to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s skills and human capital requirements by delivering on a target of 10,000 apprenticeship registrations per annum by 2025.</p>  <p>  The Plan sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make them more accessible to employers and learners. Expanding apprenticeship across all sectors of the economy has widened its impact in areas of skills shortage such as Engineering, Technology Skills, Logistics and FinTech. Under the Plan there will be an increase in online visibility of apprenticeship engagement and apprenticeship development processes for employers/sectors who wish to assess the potential for new apprenticeship development.</p>  <p>  There are currently 64 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 39 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic: Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding, Supply Chain Associate. Two new programmes have launched in recent weeks: Wind Turbine Maintenance and Bar Manager with another, Transport Operations and Commercial Driving also expected to launch shortly.</p>  <p>  There are 12 additional programmes being developed across agriculture, construction, engineering, equine, finance, horticulture, hospitality and food, ICT and logistics. A number of other potential apprenticeships are at an exploratory stage, in sectors such as health, beauty, environmental, engineering, ICT and finance.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;34 million was provided in Budget 2022 to expand apprenticeship, including the development of new programmes noted above, the establishment of the National Apprenticeship Office which will operationalise the new system, and funding to introduce a new employer grant. This grant of &euro;2,000 per eligible apprentice is designed to encourage more employers to engage with a wider range of apprenticeships and to help encourage the development of new programmes. It also means that, for the first time, all employers will receive a level of support towards the cost of apprentice training.</p>  <p>  In 2021 there were a record 8,607 registrations- up from 6,177 for 2019, the last pre-COVID full year, and the highest annual registrations since the 2006 figure of 8,306, showing the high degree of interest in this career option amongst both employers and potential apprentices. At the end of 2021, the overall apprentice population was 24,212.</p>  <p>  The increase in registrations, despite the pandemic, provides us with a solid pipeline of new talent coming through the apprenticeship system and highlights the huge interest in this area of training. The measures I have outlined above, combined with other deliverables in the Action Plan, mean that we are supporting further progress towards achieving the vision articulated in the Plan and can respond to identified skills shortages.  </p></reply>

A response is breing prioritised and will issue shortly.</p>  <p>  The nationality requirements for the Student Grant Scheme are set out in Section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and Regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2021. The candidate's nationality or immigration status in the State determines whether or not she or he meets the nationality requirement outlined in the Act and Regulations, and would be therefore eligible to qualify for a student grant. </p>  <p>  Permission to remain in the State on the basis of a Stamp 4 Visa, of itself, does not meet the nationality requirements of the Student Grant Scheme 2021. </p>  <p>  There is provision for a review of eligibility where a person&rsquo;s circumstances changes in the academic year.  This includes a change in relation to a student's nationality or immigration status. Where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation, or is granted one of the permission to remain criterion provided for in the Act or Regulations during the course of their studies, she or he may apply to SUSI to have their application re-assessed.</p>  <p>  I think it is important that our approach to these issues is equitable and consistent with the intent and purpose of the immigration permissions which are granted to individuals.</p>  <p>  Following representations from the Irish Refugee Council, NASC and others in relation to Stamp 4 visa holders, I have asked my officials to look at the issue raised today by the Deputy, including engagement with the Department of Justice and Equality. I have also asked them to look at the wider issues of alignment of SUSI and free fees supports with immigration permissions, in collaboration with other relevant Departments, and provide advice to me on whether any changes are required.  </p></reply>

It is a priority for my Department to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to their local CCTV schemes whilst ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of data protection statutory considerations.</p>  <p>  Community-based CCTV is currently governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee;</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller; and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working on a new Bill, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill, relating to Garda powers to use modern digital technology including body worn cameras, ANPR and CCTV.  As part of that Bill, it is intended to repeal Section 38 of the 2005 Act and to replace it with new CCTV provisions.</p>  <p>  The Data Protection Commission wrote to my Department on 23 September 2020 indicating that there were problems with the administration of CCTV schemes across Ireland.  There was no particular mention of schemes in County Limerick.  In that letter, the DPC offered observations on the draft general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill which are currently being addressed.  </p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recording) Bill was approved by the Government and published on 29 April 2021. The General Scheme was sent to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for formal drafting, and drafting is continuing. It is the intention to publish the Bill in the second quarter of 2022 and to complete its passage through the Oireachtas later this year.</p>  <p>  My Department first became aware of the particular problems in Limerick City and County on 21  January 2022, when the DPC forwarded its report to assist my Department in drafting the new Bill.  I understand that the Council and the Garda authorities are taking steps to address the issues raised by the DPC with a view to ensuring continuity of the CCTV schemes.</p></reply>

Beneficiaries are being provided with their permission letter on arrival at the airport in the 'one-stop-shop' established by my Department for that purpose, to ensure early access to all necessary supports. Approximately 5,800 temporary protection permissions have already been issued by my Department since the activation of the EU Directive. </p><p>Arrangements have also now been put in place to provide permission letters to those who arrived at Dublin Airport prior to 9 March (when permission letters started to issue) and to those who have arrived at other ports of entry to the State. </p><p>For people who are staying in State provided accommodation, staff from my Department are visiting these accommodation locations and will provide permission letters there. </p><p>Alternatively, permission letters can be obtained by visiting the Ukraine Support Centre in Cork Street, Dublin 8. The centre is open Monday to Friday from 9.15am to 5.00pm. On Saturdays, the centre is open from 9.15am to 3.00pm. There, people can also receive assistance from the Department of Social Protection to obtain PPSN numbers, social welfare income supports, and to receive referrals to other State services. </p><p>Arrangements are also being put in place that will allow people to obtain their permission letters from the Ukraine Support Centre in Hanover Street in Cork City and from the third Support Centre that will open shortly in Limerick. Further details on this will be announced shortly. </p><p>A centralised Government information portal is available at: www.gov.ie/ukraine, which is regularly updated. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Irish Immigration website also contains a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page, which can be viewed at: </p><p>www.irishimmigration.ie/faqs-for-ukraine-nationals-and-residents-of-ukraine/. </p></reply>

The Coroner by law is fully independent in the conduct of the inquests.</p>  <p>  Section 43 of the Coroners Act 1962 prescribes the method of jury selection for an inquest. The provisions of the Juries Act 1976, apart from one section on liability to serve on an inquest jury, do not apply. These provisions of the Juries Act relate to trials. There is no trial at an inquest; it is not an adversarial process. Rather it is a fact-finding process. No matters of criminal or civil liability or exoneration may be pronounced by the jury or the coroner at an inquest. </p>  <p>  There is no statutory authority under the Coroners Act to prescribe fees or expenses to jurors for service at inquests when summoned so do so by a coroner. The provisions of the Juries Act 1976 (specifically section 29 relating to continued payment of salaries by employers to jurors) do not apply to coroner inquests.</p>  <p>  In light of the concerns raised with regard to juries and the particular circumstances of the Stardust inquests, I indicated in my contribution in the Seanad on 23 February, that the Government will not oppose the Coroners (Provision for Jury Selection) (Amendment) Bill 2022. However, as currently drafted, there are significant technical conflicts in the Bill with existing legislation, including the Coroners Act 1962, the Juries Act 1976 and the Courts Service Act 1998. </p>  <p>  My officials and I are working to find a resolution to these issues and I hope to be in a position to present proposals to Government shortly.

From the outset of the pandemic, my Department and I have worked to provide assistance and assurance to people who use our immigration services. Since the pandemic was declared in March 2020, I have provided nine temporary extension of immigration and international protection permissions to 31 May 2022.</p><p>My Department has responsibility for immigration-related matters, including the entry and residence conditions of non-EEA students, who are granted a Stamp 2 immigration permission, and continually consults and engages with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, among other key sectorial stakeholders, in this area.</p><p>A student's primary purpose for being in the State is to study. However, since April 2001, non-EEA students with an immigration Stamp 2 permission, and who are enrolled on courses with education providers listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) including English language courses, have been afforded the opportunity to work.</p><p>This allows them to take up casual employment to supplement their income while studying in Ireland. During term time, non-EEA students can work up to 20 hours per week and during normal college holiday periods they can work on a full time basis up to 40 hours per week.</p><p>All applicants for permission to study in Ireland must show that they have sufficient funds to support their stay in Ireland without recourse to public funds, or the reliance on casual employment.</p><p>The Stamp 2 permission will typical expire shortly after the conclusion of the course. The person will then need to apply for an employment permit, leave the state or seek a change of permission to a Stamp 1G , if they met the criteria.</p><p>A Stamp 1G indicates that a person has permission to look for employment in the State under the Third Level Graduate Programme. When an applicant has completed their studies in Ireland and gained an award at Level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) or above, that person may qualify for a Stamp 1G for 12 months. Where an individual receives an award at Level 9 NFQ, they may qualify for a Stamp 1G for up to 24 months subject to the overall limit of 8 years on student conditions that applies. Graduates at level 9 NFQ or above who qualify for a Stamp 1G permission will be granted the permission for 12 months initially, further details are available on my Department's website at .</p><p>Where an individual has obtained employment and prior to the expiry of their Stamp 1G permission, it is open to the employer to submit an application for an employment permit subject to meeting the criteria. Further details available are available at: www.enterprise.gov.ie. A person must hold a critical skills employment permit for 2 years or a general employment permit for 5 years before eligibility for a Stamp 4 immigration permission arises.</p><p>Additionally, it is open to any student that is in the State in an undocumented situation to make an application to the Regularisation of Long Term Undocumented Migrants scheme, if they meet the published qualifying criteria. This is a once in a generation scheme and I encourage all those who are eligible to make an application prior to the closing of the scheme on 31 July 2022.</p></reply>

The Covid-19 Contingency Plan is an internal operational document for the management of Covid-19 outbreaks in prisons and has not been published for security and operational reasons.</p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic wide ranging infection control measures and restrictions were introduced to prevent the spread of Covid-19 within the prison estate including the suspension of physical visits, the restriction of movements within prisons and the introduction of a restricted regime for prisoners in the infected area while mass testing was underway.</p>  <p>  A substantial amount of work has been carried out by the Prison Service to address the evolving challenges, both in the broad range of protective measures designed to keep prisoners and staff safe, as well as initiatives to mitigate against the inevitable impact of Covid-related restrictions and changes in regime on those in custody, however necessary they may be. All while continuing to provide a range of rehabilitative support services for prisoners in custody.</p>  <p>  The Prison Service has been very successful in its management of Covid-19 since the pandemic commenced in March 2020. However, it is a fact that managing the risks and challenges faced in a prison context during the Covid-19 pandemic has proved to be significant, particularly over such a protracted period of time.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Prison Service has at all times been very mindful of the impact the necessary measures introduced to restrict the spread of Covid-19 have on the routine of the prisoner population and has consistently kept all such measures under review. </p>  <p>  In early 2021, the Prison Service aligned the unwinding of restrictions to the roll out of the Covid-19 vaccination programme in prisons. As a result of the successful roll out of the vaccination programme to all prisons, the Service was in a position to unwind a significant amount of restrictive measures in all locations with the exception of Cloverhill Prison which did not have a critical mass of prisoners vaccinated at the time.</p>  <p>  In mid 2021, following the latest advice from Government, the Prison Service commenced a further unwinding of measures in line with similar actions taken in the community.</p>  <p>  This included:</p>  <p>  - the recommencement of physical visits in all locations,</p>  <p>  - the removal on the restriction preventing the mixing of prisoners from different areas within the prison,</p>  <p>  - the return of constructive activities to full capacity,</p>  <p>  - the recommencement of prisoner temporary release programmes, and</p>  <p>  - the resumption of religious services.</p>  <p>  The resumption of these services was contingent on the continuation of a number of infection control measures to ensure the health and safety of both staff/service providers and prisoners. </p>  <p>  In early 2022, the Irish Prison Service undertook another significant review of infection control measures resulting in further restrictions being lifted. This included an increase in the number of visitors permitted to visit prisoners, the resumption of non-essential prison visits including the facilitation of in-reach services on a priority basis and the removal of capacity restrictions and the compulsory wearing of facial coverings.</p>  <p>  As a result the majority of restrictive measures have been lifted. However, the Prison Service, recognising the threat that Covid-19 continues to pose to the vulnerable prison population, has continued a number of infection control measures such as the quarantining of new committals and the isolation of suspected cases. All such measures are continually reviewed taking account of the community rate of transmission and the level of risk posed.</p></reply>

Government Departments and services are working together to implement Ireland's commitments under the EU Temporary Protection Directive (2001/55/EC), which has been activated for the first time to grant temporary protection to displaced persons from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  The Directive has legal effect under Section 60 of the International Protection Act 2015.</p>  <p>  Those eligible for Temporary Protection (granted initially for one year, but renewable) will have immediate access to the labour market, social welfare, accommodation and other State supports as necessary. </p>  <p>  To date, approximately 90 per cent of Ukrainians who have entered the State have been welcomed at Dublin Airport. Beneficiaries are being provided with their temporary protection permission letter on arrival in the Airport in the 'one-stop-shop' established for that purpose, to ensure early access to all necessary supports.</p>  <p>  Arrangements have also now been put in place to provide permission letters to those who arrived at Dublin Airport prior to 9 March (when permission letters started to issue) and to those who have arrived at other ports of entry to the State.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Ukraine Support Centres&rsquo; opened in Dublin and Cork, and soon to open in Limerick, are assisting those newly arrived to obtain their PPS Numbers and to access social welfare income supports, and receive referrals to other State services.</p>  <p>  A centralised Government information portal is available on www.gov.ie/ukraine, and is regularly updated.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Irish Immigration website also contains a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page at: www.irishimmigration.ie/faqs-for-ukraine-nationals-and-residents-of-ukraine/. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Government colleagues and I will continue to work with our EU counterparts on any further EU-wide measures that might be needed to assist those fleeing Ukraine. However, the immediate and overriding priority is to assist those who have arrived and continue to arrive in Ireland to find safety with access to state supports as needed, as part of a whole of Government response.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, given the very extreme pressures being faced by Moldova in the current circumstances, the Government has agreed, as part of an EU response, to offer to accept from Moldova up to 500 people who have fled the war in Ukraine. </p></reply>

It can only activated in specific circumstances by an EU Council Decision.</p>  <p>  Section 60 of the International Protection Act 2015 gives effect to the Directive in national law.</p>  <p>  On 4 March, the Council of EU agreed to activate the Temporary Protection Directive following a proposal from the European Commission. This proposal was informed by its assessment of the situation in Ukraine and the scale of the movements of displaced persons, and the advisability of establishing temporary protection, based on information from Member States, UNHCR and other relevant international organisations. It is the first time that the Directive has been activated since it was introduced.</p>  <p>  The Council Decision places specific obligations on Ireland and on all EU Member States, including the duration of the temporary protection to be awarded and the State supports and services that the beneficiary should be entitled to. This includes the right to seek employment or self-employment, access to suitable accommodation, access to primary and post primary education, access to medical care, and any necessary assistance in terms of social welfare if the person does not have sufficient resources.</p>  <p>  As this is the first occasion on which a Council Decision under Article 5 of Directive 2001/55/EC has been made, no similar EU refugee programmes exist. Therefore, it is not possible to establish comparisons. </p></reply>

This is not an immigration requirement.</p>  <p>  There is no segregation of arriving passengers at Dublin Airport. Therefore, it is not possible to distinguish CTA passengers in advance of them presenting at immigration control desks. Immigration officers must establish where passengers have arrived from, and to do this, an immigration officer may ask passengers questions to establish their nationality and port of embarkation. Where a person, who is a citizen of the CTA, and who has travelled from within the CTA, is not in possession of a passport, an immigration officer is duty-bound to ask questions to establish that the person is entitled to benefit from the CTA immigration arrangements. The production of other forms of identification can be used to assist an immigration officer with these enquiries.</p>  <p>  Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the CTA and that they have travelled from the United Kingdom, the immigration officer will make no further requirement of that person. </p></reply>

Each person who has been refused leave to land in the State is assessed on their own merits, taking all relevant information into consideration at that time. The grounds on which an Immigration Officer may refuse entry to the State are set out in Section 4(3) of the 2004 Act. These grounds include: where the person is not in possession of a valid Irish visa; where the person is not in possession of a valid passport or other equivalent document issued by an authority recognised by the Government which establishes their identity and nationality; where the person intends to take up employment in the State but does not have a valid employment permit; and where the person's presence in the State could pose a threat to national security or be contrary to public policy. </p><p>The Border Management Unit of my Department has responsibility for frontline immigration at Dublin Airport only. Other ports of entry are the responsibility of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). </p><p>As the Deputy's query relates to refusals of leave to land at all ports of entry in the State, the data from GNIB  and BMU has been combined in the table below.  <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2014 </th>       <th>2015 </th>       <th>2016 </th>       <th>2017 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ukrainian </td>       <td>76 </td>       <td>74 </td>       <td>31 </td>       <td>25 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Afghan </td>       <td>74 </td>       <td>143 </td>       <td>175 </td>       <td>117 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Syrian </td>       <td>15 </td>       <td>61 </td>       <td>38 </td>       <td>42 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 </th>       <th>2020 </th>       <th>2021 </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Ukrainian </td>       <td>17 </td>       <td>15 </td>       <td>8 </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Afghan </td>       <td>52 </td>       <td>76 </td>       <td>82 </td>       <td>198 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Syrian </td>       <td>70 </td>       <td>95 </td>       <td>162 </td>       <td>511 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>If a person indicates or is identified as being in need of international protection they are admitted to the international protection process.

The allocation of appointments with GNIB is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The Registration Office of my Department registers permissions for customers residing in the Dublin area.</p><p>Since the onset of the pandemic, immigration permissions have been extended nine times, which means that people who held a valid permission to be in the State in March 2020 are legally permitted to remain until 31 May 2022.</p><p>As a result of the unavoidable delays created from the closing of the Registration Office in Burgh Quay during Covid-19 restrictions, and the reduced capacity guidelines when open, a high number of customers are now coming forward to seek an appointment for first time registration. The Registration Office of my Department is currently operating at 100 per cent capacity.</p><p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to meet the current unprecedented demand for first-time registration appointments, on 10 January 2022, a Freephone service (1800 741 741) was introduced for customers. It is currently operating 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday (8am to 8pm) and 8 hours a day on Saturday and Sunday (9am to 5pm). There are between 15 and 20 customer service representatives taking calls and making appointments. All appointments for Dublin based customers to register their immigration permission are now issued through this service, with operators offering one appointment per call, unless it is for an identifiable family group. Approximately 21,000 customer appointments have been allocated so far. </p><p>The Registration Office&rsquo;s customer service team is also available to support customers who may have language difficulties or may need assistance with translation. A number of multi-lingual videos describing the registration process and what to expect are available on my Department's website www.irishimmigration.ie.</p><p>A new Immigration Service appointment and scheduling system is expected to be available to customers shortly, replacing the Freephone service and further streamlining and improving the registration process. The new arrangements will be communicated at the appropriate time. </p><p>Dublin based customers who are seeking to renew their permission can continue to do so online at <i>inisonline.jahs.ie/user/login.</i></p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily on-site in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  This payment will be made to those eligible public sector frontline healthcare staff (inclusive of agency staff working for the HSE) who worked in clinical settings (e.g. &ndash; and noting this list is not exhaustive: those Doctors / Nurses / Health Care Assistants / Porters / Cleaners / Vaccination Centre Staff etc. that work in clinical settings). The measure encompasses Health Care Support Assistants (also known as Home Carers / Home Help) employed by or carrying out duties contracted to the HSE. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices (e.g. nursing homes and hospices that are private, public, section 39, voluntary etc.) that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health appreciates the levels of interest this announcement has generated. We are working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, particulars and terms and conditions that apply. This will be published as soon as possible.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p>  <p>  This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Accordingly, the NTPF does not discuss publicly the details of negotiations with individual nursing homes. Neither Ministers nor the Department have a role in individual price negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing. </p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system.

Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.04 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.</p>  <p>  The department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.</p></reply>

Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The Minister for Health has no role in these decisions.</p>  <p>The HSE Corporate Pharmaceutical Unit (CPU) is the interface between the HSE and the Pharmaceutical Industry in relation to medicine pricing and reimbursement applications.  The HSE CPU received an application for pricing / reimbursement of Melatonin (Slenyto&reg; Prolonged-Release Tablets) on 3 July 2019 from Flynn Pharma for the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents aged 2-18 with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and / or Smith-Magenis syndrome, where sleep hygiene measures have been insufficient.</p>  <p>  On 31 July 2019, the HSE CPU requested that Flynn Pharma submit a rapid review dossier to the NCPE for assessment. To date Flynn Pharma has not submitted a rapid review dossier to the NCPE for assessment. As it currently stands, submission of a completed rapid review dossier to the NCPE is required to progress this application, as per the formal processes governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In relation to the reimbursement of Melatonin (Circadin), the HSE advise that Melatonin (Circadin) has never been available through the Reimbursement List under the Community Drug Schemes. Melatonin (Circadin) underwent a review in 2008 and reimbursement was not recommended by the NCPE as there was insufficient evidence to support the reimbursement of this product under the Community Drug Schemes (available at www.ncpe.ie/drugs/melatonin-circadin/).  </p>  <p>  However, the HSE advise that exceptional arrangements are considered for Melatonin (Circadin) under Section 23 of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 - Supply of items not on Reimbursement List. The HSE must be satisfied that:</p>  <p>  (a) The patient requires that item for clinical reasons, and</p>  <p>  (b) There is no listed item which is a suitable alternative for that item in so far as that patient is concerned.</p>  <p>  All applications for Melatonin (Circadin) under Discretionary Hardship Arrangements are reviewed on an individual patient basis under Section 23.</p>  <p>  The medical decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient. The Minister for Health has no role in this clinical decision-making process and Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p></reply>

The cost of prescription contraception;</p><p>2. The cost of a minimum of two consultations per annum with GPs and other doctors to discuss suitable contraception for individual patients and to enable prescription of same;</p><p>3. The cost of fitting and/or removal of various types of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) plus any necessary checks, by medical professionals certified to fit/remove same;</p><p>4. The cost of training and certifying additional medical professionals to fit and remove LARCs;</p><p>5. Provision of contraceptive options currently available to GMS (medical) card holders through this scheme, to include contraceptive injections, implants, IUS and IUDs (coils), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill, including emergency contraception.</p><p>Increasing the supports for gynaecological conditions, including polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis, is a key element of the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, which was launched on International Women&rsquo;s Day (March 8<sup>th</sup>, 2022). &euro;5.3 million has been allocated in 2022 to grow access to &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; gynaecology clinics, specialist menopause clinics, and specialist endometriosis services for complex care.</p><p>As the roll out of free contraception is being introduced in phases by age cohort, patients with endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome; will be accommodated as their age group becomes eligible; those holding GMS (medical) cards are already eligible for free contraception, subject only to the prescription charge. Those holding GP Visit cards are currently eligible for free consultation costs, and those ordinarily resident in Ireland are eligible for the Drugs Payment Scheme, which limits the cost of prescription medication to no more than &euro;80 in a calendar month. </p><p>Work on the legislative framework for the scheme is ongoing. Formal negotiations with medical and other relevant representative bodies with regard to service provision are due to commence in March/April 2022.</p><p>The capacity within the health system to fit and remove LARCs was examined by the Working Group on Contraception; the Report is available on the Department's website. At time of publication in 2019, there were over 1,000 GPs holding LARC certification and that there was scope for enabling practitioners to develop their skills further by promoting further integration between the hospital and community sector and developing local centres of expertise in sexual and reproductive health services.</p><p>As part of the Budget 2022 allocation, funds are being made available for additional training capacity with respect to certification of medical professionals to fit and remove LARCs. The HSE is currently working on preparing to roll out these additional training supports.</p></reply>

The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT patches has increased by between 77% and 117%, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of this patch in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.</p>  <p> Regarding the HRT patches, the suppliers have confirmed that they have increased the planned supply of HRT patches to Ireland during 2022 in response to this increased demand. In the case of one brand (Evorel/Evorel Conti), the supply of HRT patches has resumed. For another brand (Estradot), some strengths are available currently and, based on manufacturing availability, the re-supply of the full range is expected to be in July. With respect to the gels, the supplier of Divigel has indicated that it expects supply to resume next week (week beginning 21st March). Supply of an alternative gel product (Oestrogel) has recently run out and is expected to resume in April. In the interim, the companies have indicated that they are working to find solutions to the immediate supply issues.</p>  <p>  The current supply situation has arisen due to significant increases in demand for HRT medicines and is not linked to regulatory matters. However, the HPRA continues to review available options within their regulatory remit to facilitate increased supply where at all possible. In particular, the HPRA has advised companies that they are open to providing accelerated regulatory approval to supply a product originally intended for other markets if available. HPRA are awaiting further information from the companies in this regard.</p>  <p>  The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.</p>  <p>  The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.</p></reply>

For the duration of the Covid-19 public health emergency, where the need for social distancing, reducing personal contacts and reducing the burden on medical practitioners are paramount, it became possible for a woman to access a termination under section 12 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 (i.e., before 12 weeks) from her medical practitioner by telephone or video conference consultation.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to monitor service provision, facilitate the smooth-running of the service and resolve any issues that may arise. However, with restrictions eased, the Department is currently reviewing whether remote consultation as part of a blended approach to termination of pregnancy care should be continued post the COVID-19 public health emergency period. A decision is expected in the coming weeks. It is important to reflect that COVID-19 is still with us and Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) guidance on Managing Risk of Transmission of Respiratory Viruses including COVID-19, continues to advise, amongst other things, to limit footfall in General Practice settings and support telephone consultations where care that meets the needs of the patient can be delivered - this helps to eliminate the risk of transmission of viral infection. As such the arrangements for remote access to this service in the context of COVID-19 remain in place. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-22a.2368.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032200092#WRMM00400"><p>International evidence shows that patients benefit from having access to high quality clinical trials and overall outcomes are better in health systems that support clinical trials. The COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrated the strong link between people&rsquo;s health, the capacity of our health and social care system, and the economy. My Department, and the Health Research Board (HRB) a statutory body which operates under the aegis of the Department Health, continuously builds linkages with European partners and stakeholders to integrate Ireland&rsquo;s participation in clinical trials internationally.</p>  <p>  Since 2010, the Health Research Board (HRB) has been driving the growth of clinical trials in Ireland and putting in place the supporting research infrastructure with the overall aim of facilitating clinical trials in Ireland that can benefit patients, the healthcare system, and the economy. Facilities are located at hospital sites to enable the conduct of trials and intervention studies, to provide specialist support services and to link with clinical trial networks and to provide trial design and methodology supports. Clinical trial facilities provide a single point of access to resources, knowledge and skills, and are a key part of the national research landscape.</p>  <p>  As part of this vision, the Department of Health secured in 2018 Government approval to fund Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the ECRIN-ERIC network (European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network - a European Research Infrastructure Consortium) to increase access for Irish patients to multi-national clinical trials. ECRIN membership also makes it easier for Irish researchers to extend their own trials internationally and help improve patient safety and quality of care. Membership gives Irish researchers full access to all the tools and services within ECRIN-ERIC, such as trial preparation, protocol review, trial management, data centre certification, capacity building projects, and ECRIN supported trials. The HRB funds Irish membership of the ECRIN-ERIC network.  </p>  <p>  The HRB also provides the only dedicated funding stream (i.e., Definitive Interventions and Feasibility Awards) for clinical trials and interventions in Ireland, which supports studies evaluating a full scale, definitive trial of an intervention of any appropriate design to provide high quality evidence on the efficacy, effectiveness, cost and broad impact of the intervention. In the previous strategy (2016-2020) HRB made a total investment of &euro;22M across 33 studies. Applicants can apply for HRB funding for trials and interventions for rare diseases and given the importance of international collaboration for rare disease trials, HRB can also support costs for patients outside of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Under the current strategy (2021-2025) the HRB will continue to invest in Clinical Research Facilities and centres nationally to improve the quality and quantity of trials in Ireland, to support a single point of access for multi-site clinical trials in Ireland (the National Clinical Trials Office) and to fund Clinical Trials Networks to bring groups of clinicians and patients together to enable trials.</p>  <p>  The HRB announced a new investment in a Rare Disease Clinical Trial Network (RD-CTN) on 28th February this year. The RD-CTN will allow people with rare disease greater opportunities for participation in the latest research and more access to innovative new therapies that will improve outcomes and transform treatment and care. The objectives of the RD-CTN are to act as a collaborative hub for trials in rare diseases, facilitate and support the conduct of trials in rare disease and increase the opportunities for patients to access high-quality clinical trials.</p>  <p>  This investment builds on prior investments by the HRB to advance research in rare diseases (&euro;14M in the last decade), including through the HRB-HRCI Joint Funding Scheme, our contribution to the work of IPPOSI, the European Joint Programme in Rare Diseases, European Joint Transnational Calls in Rare Diseases.</p>  <p>  In January 2022 (Minister Donnelly) welcomed news that Ireland is a new member of 15 European Reference Networks (ERNs), including one dedicated to rare neurological diseases, which supports Huntington&rsquo;s Disease. ERNs are virtual networks for clinicians and researchers across the EU to share expertise, knowledge and resources on rare diseases. ERNs convene virtual advisory panels of medical specialists across different disciplines, using a dedicated IT platform and telemedicine tools, to review a patient with a rare disease&rsquo;s diagnosis and treatment. They are important hubs for research on rare diseases and provide a basis for collaborative research across the EU, including for clinical trials.</p>  <p>  In parallel with this development the HRB is engaged in the intensive discussions underway in Europe around a proposed Rare Diseases Partnership, which has the stated ambition of improving the health and well-being of people living with a rare disease by making Europe a world leader in innovation to address the unmet needs of 30 million persons living with a rare disease in Europe. An aim of the Partnership is to enable every consenting patient living with a rare disease to be findable and enrolled in a suitable clinical study; generating advances in prevention, diagnosis, understanding of diseases and developing treatments. Emphasis in these discussions has focused on how to overcome challenges associated with rare disease clinical studies and trials, how to create capacity and infrastructure to facilitate this, of the need for European clinical research networks working in this area and in particular networks that could leverage and expand the research capacities of ERNs.</p>  <p>  In summary, the HRB-supported RD-CTN can build on the prior significant investment by the HRB in specialist clinical trial facilities, support services and networks, develop strong collaborative links through the European Reference Networks to further develop and support the research agenda in rare diseases and can support and complement the strategic agenda of the EU Rare Disease Partnership and all associated stakeholders and organisations.</p></reply>

Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p><p>In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The Minister for Health has no role in these decisions.</p><p>The HSE Corporate Pharmaceutical Unit (CPU) is the interface between the HSE and the Pharmaceutical Industry in relation to medicine pricing and reimbursement applications.  The HSE CPU received an application for pricing / reimbursement of Melatonin (Slenyto&reg; Prolonged-Release Tablets) on the 3<sup>rd</sup>July 2019 from Flynn Pharma for the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents aged 2-18 with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and / or Smith-Magenis syndrome, where sleep hygiene measures have been insufficient.</p><p>On the 31<sup>st</sup>July 2019, the HSE CPU requested that Flynn Pharma submit a rapid review dossier to the NCPE for assessment. To date Flynn Pharma has not submitted a rapid review dossier to the NCPE for assessment. As it currently stands, submission of a completed rapid review dossier to the NCPE is required to progress this application, as per the formal processes governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicines.</p><p>In relation to the reimbursement of Melatonin (Circadin), the HSE advise that Melatonin (Circadin) has never been available through the Reimbursement List under the Community Drug Schemes. Melatonin (Circadin) underwent a review in 2008 and reimbursement was not recommended by the NCPE as there was insufficient evidence to support the reimbursement of this product under the Community Drug Schemes (available at www.ncpe.ie/drugs/melatonin-circadin/). </p><p>However, the HSE advise that exceptional arrangements are considered for Melatonin (Circadin) under Section 23 of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 - Supply of items not on Reimbursement List. The HSE must be satisfied that:</p><p>(a) The patient requires that item for clinical reasons, and</p><p>(b) There is no listed item which is a suitable alternative for that item in so far as that patient is concerned.</p><p>All applications for Melatonin (Circadin) under Discretionary Hardship Arrangements are reviewed on an individual patient basis under Section 23.</p><p>The medical decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient. The Minister for Health has no role in this clinical decision-making process and Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p></reply>

As well as national initiatives, Ireland (via the Health Research Board) is actively involved in the European Commission&rsquo;s health research response to the COVID-19 pandemic through the EU Framework Programmes.</p>  <p>  My Department plays a leading role in public health and medical research in Ireland. The Department supports research in these areas through the Health Research Board (HRB), a statutory body which operates under the aegis of the Department and a lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research. The HRB supports the conduct of clinical research and clinical trials (in addition to health services research, population health research, and managing several national health information systems) on behalf of the Department.</p>  <p>  As the global COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, evidence emerged that some patients who survive the virus are experiencing prolonged symptoms and complications beyond the initial period of acute infection and illness. Termed Long COVID, it can present with clusters of symptoms that are often overlapping and fluctuating. Symptoms include breathlessness, headaches, cough, fatigue and cognitive impairment or &lsquo;brain fog&rsquo;, while there is also emerging evidence that some people experience organ damage. As yet, there are no clear indicators in research to suggest why one person may develop prolonged issues and another would not. Therefore, greater focus is now being placed on assessing this and the possible causes, in order that treatments and supports can be developed and in order to better understand any long-term consequences.</p>  <p>  Recent long-Covid studies include the following:</p>  <p>  Alimentary Pharmabotic Centre (APC) Microbiome Ireland in UCC conducted a study which has shown that the levels of multiple biomarkers are altered in serum from patients with long-Covid, even nine months after the initial infection with SARS-CoV-2. Over 1,000 molecules were measured in patient serum, and a subset of these molecules were shown to be at different levels in patients compared to healthy volunteers. These differences indicate an ongoing activation of the immune system, which were coupled with differences in molecules generated during metabolism, gives some hints at what might be underpinning long term symptoms such as fatigue and brain fog. Overall, the study findings identify novel mechanistic and potential diagnostic markers as well as potential therapeutic targets in long-Covid patients. </p>  <p>  Another study, led by researchers from the Centre for Vascular Biology in the RCSI School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences published evidence showing that patients with long-Covid continue to have higher measures of blood clotting, which may help explain their persistent symptoms, such as reduced physical fitness and fatigue. Clotting markers were significantly elevated in the blood of patients with long-Covid syndrome compared with healthy controls and these clotting markers were higher in patients who required hospitalisation with their initial COVID-19 infection. Even those patients that were able to manage their illness at home still had persistently high clotting markers. The researchers observed that higher clotting was directly related to other symptoms of long-Covid syndrome, such as reduced physical fitness and fatigue. Even though markers of inflammation had all returned to normal levels, this increased clotting potential was still present in long-Covid patients. This work was funded through the Wellcome Trust-Health Research Board Irish Clinical Academic Training (ICAT) programme as well through a HRB-funded Irish COVID-19 Vasculopathy Study.</p>  <p>  Please also note the following information regarding other initiatives/trials:</p>  <p>  The international peer review process is at an advanced stage for the HRB&rsquo;s largest project scheme, the 2022 Investigator Led Projects Scheme and this includes a number of grant applications focusing on long-Covid. The outcomes of this call will be available in June 2022.</p>  <p>  Ireland, with the support of the DoH and HRB, continues to participate in the WHO Solidarity PLUS trial. This is a platform trial that represents the largest global collaboration among WHO member states. It involves thousands of researchers in over 600 hospitals in 52 countries, including sites across Ireland. This allows the trial to assess multiple treatments at the same time using a single protocol, recruiting thousands of patients to generate robust estimates on the effect a drug may have on mortality-even moderate effects. It also allows new treatments to be added and ineffective treatments to be dropped throughout the course of the trial. Previously, four drugs were evaluated by the trial. The results showed that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and interferon had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Three further therapies were introduced in late 2021- artesunate, imatinib and infliximab &ndash; with the aim of reducing the risk of death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also participating in EU SolidAct, a randomized, multifactorial, adaptive platform trial for COVID-19 and emerging infectious diseases and pandemics. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a range of interventions to improve outcome of (i) hospitalized patients with moderate disease, and (ii) hospitalized patients with severe and critical disease.</p>  <p>  Once the underlying mechanisms and causes of long-Covid become clearer, Ireland will be well placed, through the above platform trials, to engage in international trials assessing the effectiveness of treatments for long-Covid.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

A target of 2% had been recommended in  <i>A Policy on the Development of Graduate to Advanced Nursing and Midwifery Practice</i>. I have allocated funding of &euro;11.9m to the HSE in 2022  for 164 new AN/MP posts </p><p>At the end of January 2022, there were 41,792 WTE in the nursing and midwifery workforce. Increasing the workforce number of AN/MPs by 1% would result in an additional 418 WTE based on current WTE numbers. The cost is based on the salaries for AN/MPs &euro;64,465 (midpoint of the candidate salary scale)  with 11% employers PRSI added. There are also education costs of &euro;6,000 per year ( 2 year requirement)  for MSc Advanced Practice. A 1% increase therefore would be approximately &euro;33,179,586 rising to approximately &euro;33,966,262 (ongoing cost)  for salary. In addition there is a once off education cost associated with the 1% uplift of approximately  &euro;5,016,000. </p><p>As of 1 March 2022, the number of Advanced Nurse and Midwife Practitioners (AN/MPs) is 733 WTE (1.76% of the workforce), comprising 533 WTE Registered AN/MP posts and 180 WTE candidate AN/MP posts. </p></reply>

The effect of these regulations is to designate the professions of counsellor and psychotherapist under the Act and to establish one registration board for both professions. Members were appointed to the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board in February 2019 and they held their inaugural meeting in May 2019.</p>  <p>  The work of a registration board includes consideration of the titles to be protected and the minimum qualifications to be required of existing practitioners and the qualifications that will be required for future graduates. The work of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board is significantly more challenging than it is for registration boards for some of the more established professions owing to the different and complex pathways into these professions, the variety of titles used, and the variety and number of courses and course providers. This work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The annual financial statements of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council (CORU) are laid before both houses of the Oireachtas and are publicly available from the Oireachtas Library.</p>  <p>  I hope that this information is of assistance to you.</p></reply>

We are working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, particulars and terms and conditions that apply. This will be published as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so.</p></reply>

Based on the totality of available scientific data on this drug, it is known that children exposed in utero are at a high risk of serious developmental disorders (in up to 30-40% of cases) and congenital malformations (in approximately 10% of cases). </p>  <p>  To prevent exposure during pregnancy, there is a robust regulatory framework for the licensed use of Epilim in women of childbearing potential. This regulatory framework was strengthened following participation by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in two EU-wide reviews in 2014 and 2017. </p>  <p>  After the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued new recommendations on the use of sodium valproate in early 2018, the HPRA collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the new valproate risk-minimisation measures in Ireland. These measures included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed. </p>  <p>  To support the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying any medicine containing valproate. This includes providing counselling and including a Package Leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines. </p>  <p>  To address the more operational aspects of this issue, a HSE Valproate Response Project was established in May 2018 under the remit of the HSE Office of the Chief Clinical Officer. The Project Team was able to provide expert support to individuals and families with concerns about previous exposure to valproate and the possible impact on their children. The HSE team has also worked to improve the structures in place to support families affected by foetal valproate syndrome. A specialist dedicated genetics clinic has been established in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, to support diagnosis, and the HSE is working to improve access to genetic testing. </p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s medium- to long-term response to the valproate issue is focused on the establishment of a Programme for Women&rsquo;s Health in Epilepsy within one of the Regional Epilepsy Centres, which will coordinate this national response. This means that all women taking valproate will have yearly follow-up, sign a valproate agreement form, be kept up-to-date with developments and signposted to other services, including the diagnostic service for those potentially exposed during pregnancy. </p>  <p>  Details of the proposed inquiry into the historical licensing and use of sodium valproate in Ireland, and the establishment of a related stakeholder group, are currently being considered by officials within the Department of Health.</p></reply>

Immunisation not only protects individuals, but also others in the community, by reducing the spread of disease.  I am fully committed to improving the immunisation uptake rates in the general population and am keen to ensure that vaccines are as accessible as possible, where appropriate.</p>  <p>  I very much appreciate the fundamental role community pharmacists play in the wider Irish Health Service in the delivery of holistic patient care and in supporting the direction of travel envisaged in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Currently, adult vaccinations are available either from a patient&rsquo;s General Practitioner (GP), a pharmacist or in the case of Covid19, at a Covid19 vaccination centre.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, pharmacists under the provisions of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 S.I. No. 525 of 2011, have been authorised to provide a seasonal influenza vaccination service in pharmacies, and to supply and administer adrenaline injections for the emergency treatment of anaphylactic shock that may arise from the administration of such vaccines. This legislation provides a framework whereby the authority to autonomously &ldquo;supply and administer&rdquo; specified prescription controlled medicinal products is given to pharmacists, in addition to the authority conferred in the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 to supply prescription controlled medicinal products of receipt of a prescription issued by a practitioner authorised to do so.   </p>  <p>  In 2015 the legislation was amended to permit pharmacists to &ldquo;supply and administer&rdquo; two additional vaccines, the pneumococcal polysaccharide and herpes zoster (shingles) vaccines. In 2020, in response to the Covid-19 Pandemic this authority was extended to allow pharmacists fully participate in the provision of vaccination services in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Thereafter the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. No.32/2022) added an additional herpes zoster vaccine to those which pharmacists were authorised to supply and administer. </p>  <p>  The autonomous &ldquo;supply and administration&rdquo; of any vaccine by a pharmacist is subject to the completion of approved training by the pharmacist, and the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland as published and updated by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, which is the entity responsible for the regulation of pharmacists and pharmacies in Ireland has produced guidance to support pharmacists in providing vaccination services in line with the legislation. It details the general requirements for providing vaccination services and additional considerations specific to the provision of each particular vaccination service. This governance framework is in place to assure trust and safety for all patients and the public on receipt of such services, and the consideration of any expansion of service will be subject to these criteria. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Pneumococcal vaccine, NIAC have recommended the Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) for those aged over 65 years and individuals in certain at-risk groups.  The Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) may also be prescribed for those in at risk groups.  These vaccines are available from an individual&rsquo;s GP. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that there are no plans in place at present to review or revise the current vaccine provision arrangements.</p></reply>

I am confident that this investment will continue to improve diagnosis and access to services for people with dementia across the country, enabling people with dementia to live well for as long as possible.</p><p>The additional funding will allow for a range of measures to enhance services and supports for people with dementia. These services include:</p><p>- 5 new memory assessment and support services and one new regional specialist memory clinic in Galway</p><p>- Specialist diagnostic services for people with an intellectual disability through the National Intellectual Disability Memory Service in Tallaght University Hospital</p><p>- Enhancement of memory technology resource rooms to demonstrate assistive technology options for people living with dementia</p><p>- Implementation of a dementia minimum dataset across all care settings to standardise data collection and reporting</p><p>- 6 dementia assistant director of nursing posts (one in each hospital group) to improve quality and safety of care for people with dementia</p><p>- 4 additional dementia clinical nurse specialists to improve care pathways in acute care settings</p><p>- Undertake the third wave of the Irish National Audit of Dementia in acute hospitals</p><p>- Promote brain health and reduce the prevalence and delay the onset of dementia through collaboration with clinical programmes, the understand together campaign and dementia risk reduction group through the provision of a brain health project manager</p><p>In addition, the Government is committed to the development of improved community-based services, shifting care to the home, and offering greater choice for older people including people living with dementia. As Minister with responsibility for this area I have prioritised home support services so that additional funding secured in Budget 2021 to provide an extra 5 million hours has been maintained under Budget 2022. It is estimated that in 2021 some 20.4 million hours had been provided to over 55,000 people. This is about 2.9 million more hours compared to 2020, an increase of 17%.</p><p>In addition to the &euro;7.3m for dementia services outlined above, the proportion of new home support hours ringfenced for people with dementia will more than double from 5% in 2021 to 11% in 2022.</p><p>Taken together, this will represent 15 million euro of investment dedicated to dementia specific supports and services in 2022, on top of the &euro;12.9m of additional funding in 2021.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware I have long been an advocate for the development of services for people with dementia and their families and I am pleased to be able to continue the focused investment in these services and supports in 2022.</p></reply>

The cost of prescription contraception;</p><p>2. The cost of a minimum of two consultations per annum with GPs and other doctors to discuss suitable contraception for individual patients and to enable prescription of same;</p><p>3. The cost of fitting and/or removal of various types of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) plus any necessary checks, by medical professionals certified to fit/remove same;</p><p>4. The cost of training and certifying additional medical professionals to fit and remove LARCs;</p><p>5. Provision of contraceptive options currently available to GMS (medical) card holders through this scheme, to include contraceptive injections, implants, IUS and IUDs (coils), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oralcontraceptive pill, including emergency contraception.</p><p>Full year costs for the 17-25 age cohort are currently estimated at &euro;26 million.  This figure is based on using methods analogous to those published in the Report of the Working Group on Contraception. The estimated cost of rolling out the scheme to women aged 17-55 is approximately &euro;110 million. Formal costings for specific age ranges outside the 17-25 year cohort have not been completed, as the scheme is being rolled out in line with the Programme for Government, starting with 17-25 year olds. </p><p>Expanding the scheme to further age cohorts will be considered following the monitoring and evaluation the scheme for 17&ndash;25-year-olds, once operational. Costings for additional age cohorts will be refined once real world data from the operational 17-25 year old scheme is available. This will ensure that the scheme is working smoothly in terms of gauging demand levels and ensuring sufficient numbers of medical practitioners are certified to fit and remove LARCs.</p><p>As part of the Budget 2022 allocation, funds are being made available for additional training capacity with respect to certification of medical professionals to fit and remove LARCs. The HSE is currently working on preparing to roll out these additional training supports.</p></reply>

Consideration of and options for the scope of a public funding model for advanced AHR treatment, including necessary considerations of eligibility criteria or the types of treatment to be provided, need to be developed further.  ‎</p>  <p>  ‎The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 has been introduced to the D&aacute;il, is scheduled for Second Stage this week and my priority is to ensure the progress of this Bill as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  While advanced AHR treatment, such as IVF, is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I understand that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF, or other advanced AHR treatment, privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department and the Government is fully committed, through the full implementation of the model of care for infertility, to ensuring that patients always receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system. The underlying aim of the policy to provide a model of funding for AHR, within the broader AHR regulatory framework, is to improve accessibility to AHR treatments, while at the same time embedding safe and appropriate clinical practice and ensuring the cost-effective use of public resources.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. It is estimated that the measure will cost &euro;100 million as shall apply to an estimated 100,000 eligible public sector healthcare workers.</p>  <p>  This payment will be made to those eligible public sector frontline healthcare staff (inclusive of agency staff working for the HSE) who worked in clinical settings (e.g. &ndash; and noting this list is not exhaustive: those Doctors / Nurses / Health Care Assistants / Porters / Cleaners etc. that work in clinical settings. The measure encompasses Health Care Support Assistants (also known as Home Carers / Home Help) employed by or carrying out duties contracted to the HSE. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions on this matter. This consultation is part of the Department and HSE&rsquo;s objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly. Upon conclusion of consultations with the trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars including how the pro-rata shall apply shall be published by the HSE. </p>  <p>  Though noting the above work is still ongoing, it is envisaged that the process for paying eligible public sector healthcare workers will commence this month. For eligible healthcare workers in private sector nursing homes and hospices, noting the additional complexities involved, it is envisaged the process will commence in the second quarter of this year. </p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached document which provides the waiting list by time band as at 24<sup>th</sup>Feb 2022 the latest figures published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p><p>Children waiting for Hypospadias procedures as at 24/02/2022 <table>    <tr>       <th>Time bands (months)</th>       <th><div> 0-6 Mths</div></th>       <th><div> 6-12 Mths</div></th>       <th><div>12-18 Mths</div></th>       <th><div>18+ Mths</div></th>       <th><div>SmallVolTimeBands*</div></th>       <th><div>Grand Total</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CHI at Crumlin</td>       <td><div>19</div></td>       <td><div>24</div></td>       <td><div>28</div></td>       <td><div>53</div></td>       <td></td>       <td><div>124</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>CHI at Temple St</td>       <td><div>13</div></td>       <td><div>6</div></td>       <td></td>       <td><div>14</div></td>       <td></td>       <td><div>33</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SmallVolHospitals</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td><div>9*</div></td>       <td><div>9</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td><div>32</div></td>       <td><div>30</div></td>       <td><div>28</div></td>       <td><div>67</div></td>       <td><div>9</div></td>       <td><div>166</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Due to the small volume of patients waiting, to preserve patient confidentiality, when the number of patients is &amp;lt;5, these have been included within broader timebands and aggregated into a 'Small Volume Group' cohort.</p></reply>

This work is taking place with the support of the Irish Red Cross and NGOs and charities across the country. </p>  <p>  A webpage on the whole-of-Government response is available at www.gov.ie/ukraine and includes information on supports and services available to people arriving from Ukraine. This webpage will be supplemented and updated on an ongoing basis with the support of the relevant Departments.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is liaising with other Government departments and agencies to provide humanitarian support for Ukrainian refugees. It is a priority for the Department and the HSE to ensure that Ukrainian refugees are provided with appropriate health and social care services. </p>  <p>  Refugees from the Ukraine will be granted temporary protection status. Under this measure, refugees will be considered ordinarily resident in Ireland for a limited time period and therefore will be entitled to access health care services, in line with other refugee groups and Irish citizens.</p>  <p>  A one-stop-shop is being provided in Dublin airport and other locations for Ukrainian refugees. This includes application for temporary protection status, PPSN and welfare payment, emergency accommodation and information on health services, including a medical card.</p>  <p>  My Department is collaborating with the HSE to ensure that refugees have access to the same range of health care services as Irish and EU citizens. </p>  <p>  Refugees holding temporary protection status will be entitled to apply for a medical card order to access primary care services for each adult and child dependents. A process will be implemented to facilitate timely access to a medical card, based on the Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) provided by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Health care services will include primary health care services for adults, children and older people, ongoing care of priority medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illness, services for psychological stress and mental health, and social care services for people with special needs. It is the intention to provide these services in a culturally appropriate manner and to take into account language and other factors.</p>  <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development is linking with key stakeholders at community level, including local volunteer centres, to provide information on the national response, support the co-ordination of immediate and ongoing integration and social supports through the local and community development sector, ensure complementarity with national and local government initiatives and enable flexibility in programme delivery to focus on the response.</p>  <p>  In addition, offers of medical and mental health specific support can be notified by email to the HSE at socialinclusion@hse.ie with the subject: Ukraine.  </p>  <p>  I appreciate the social solidarity of the Irish people for the Ukrainian refugees and their desire to assist with the national effort to provide accommodation and other supports.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of February 2022 there were 5,043 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,440 in December 2018.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy regarding the number of patients currently on the cataract waiting list broken down by each hospital in the South-South West Hospital Group area is outlined in the attached document.</p><p>IPDC Cataracts waits in South/South West Hospital Group as at 24/02/2022 <table>    <tr>       <th>Time Bands (months)</th>       <th><div> 0-6 Mths</div></th>       <th><div> 6-12 Mths</div></th>       <th><div>12-18 Mths</div></th>       <th><div>18+ Mths</div></th>       <th><div>Small Vol TimeBand*</div></th>       <th><div>Grand Total</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Small Vol Hospital</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td><div>2*</div></td>       <td><div>2</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital</td>       <td><div>229</div></td>       <td><div>38</div></td>       <td><div>5</div></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td><div>272</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>University Hospital Waterford</td>       <td><div>448</div></td>       <td><div>64</div></td>       <td><div>15</div></td>       <td><div>71</div></td>       <td></td>       <td><div>598</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total</td>       <td><div>677</div></td>       <td><div>102</div></td>       <td><div>20</div></td>       <td><div>71</div></td>       <td><div>2</div></td>       <td><div>872</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Due to the small volume of patients waiting, to preserve patient confidentiality, when the number of patients is &amp;lt;5, these have been included within broader timebands and aggregated into a 'Small Volume Group' cohort.</p></reply>

At present all children up to and including the age of 5 are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under in three phases: to children aged 6 and 7; to children aged 8 and 9; and to children aged 10,11 and 12. Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7. My officials and the HSE are currently engaged in preparatory work for the expansion.  Consultations with the IMO, representing GPs, are set to begin by the end of this month. </p></reply>

Furthermore, the advertising of infant formula is restricted to publications specialising in baby care and scientific publications. &lsquo;Such advertisements may contain only information of a scientific and factual nature.

It is envisaged that the Bill will include a provision to enable the operation of disease-specific &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; registries, including a virtual national diabetes registry, where information on disease diagnoses and treatment from healthcare providers is efficiently collated, combined and quality-checked from administrative records to create a database akin to an active registry for each disease. This will greatly improve the potential to monitor rare-disease prevalence in Ireland.</p></reply>

Retention efforts by the HSE both nationally and locally are in place with significant career development and progression and educational/development opportunities being offered. The Department is working with the National Doctors Training and Planning (NDTP) Office of the HSE in relation to medical workforce planning and initiatives aimed at increasing opportunities for training and career progression for trainee doctors.<b></b>Opportunities for training and career progression for doctors in the Irish Health system continue to evolve. Examples of the initiatives include: </p><p>- The Introduction of the online National Employment Record (NER) has now eliminated the requirement for duplication of paperwork associated with NCHD rotations. </p><p>- Enhanced Financial Supports: The Training Support Scheme (TSS), introduced in July 2019, provides reimbursement for approved exams, courses or conferences and is open to all NCHDs. Since July 2019 the full costs of approved examination/courses are eligible for refund to NCHDs under the Clinical Course Exam Refund Scheme (CCERS), this was previously capped at &euro;450. </p><p>- Greater predictability of the location of rotations are now provided to trainees at the outset of training. All newly appointed trainees receive a minimum of 2 years pre-defined rotations, a minimum of 13 weeks prior to commencing training/entry to their training scheme, while trainees entering year 3 of a training scheme receive a minimum of 2 years pre-defined rotations a minimum of 13 weeks prior to commencing year 3 of the scheme. </p><p>- Increased rationalised training opportunities: A number of training schemes are moving towards more a regionalised structure of training. This is specialty dependent, but examples include the intern rotations which take place within a particular intern network and geographic location.</p><p>- Introduction of the Lead NCHD programme: The programme was introduced to provide a formal link at hospital management level between NCHDs and management, and to develop leadership capacity within NCHDs. The programme now runs across 32 acute hospitals, Community Health Organisations (CHOs), Public Health and Primary Care settings.</p><p>- NDTP have recently launched a new E-Portfolio / Logbook accessible to NCHDs via their National Employment Record. The principal objective of the E-Portfolio is to allow NCHDs who are not on a formal training scheme  access to a generic standard document to record their training and career development. It also provides the opportunity to have their experience validated by their supervising Consultant where applicable. </p><p>The HSE NDTP Office is in the initial stages of work regarding doctors who completed an internship in Ireland. Early and provisional data shows that a high percentage of medical interns who graduate leave Ireland for at least one year. However, the data shows that 82% of interns who commenced one year intern training in July 2015 subsequently commenced a Basic Specialist Training (BST) or General Practice (GP) training programme in subsequent years (2016-2021).

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-22a.2834.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032200099#WRTT01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1006 and 1007 together.</p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  The programme for the academic year 2020/2021 was paused during the first few months of 2021 due to school closures and redeployment of staff to the COVID-19 immunisation programme. The inputting of uptake information for the schools-based programme was also delayed due to redeployment of administrative staff. The HSE has advised that the Schools Immunisation Programme 2020/2021 (of which the HPV programme is included) has been completed across the country. This means that all those who were eligible to receive the HPV vaccine have now been offered it.</p>  <p>  The current recorded uptake rate for the first dose of the HPV vaccine, in the 2020/2021 academic year, is 76%. The current recorded uptake rate for the second dose of the HPV vaccine in this academic year is 65%. It should be noted that some areas are yet to input some, or all, of their data for both dose 1 and 2 so these figures are expected to increase.</p>  <p>  My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:</p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and</p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p>  <p>  If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of February 2022 there were 5,043 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,276 in February 2019.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p>  <p>  This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p>  <p>  The NTPF have advised that they have provided funding for a number of insourcing initiatives to reduce Ophthalmology waiting lists at the University of Limerick Hospital Group in 2022 and to date in 2022, 2,500 patients have been approved for treatment through these initiatives. </p></reply>

The scheme is administered by local authorities and more information can be found here: <i>www.gov.ie/en/service/6636c-housing-adaptation-grants-for-older-people-and-people-with-a-disability/</i></p><p>In late 2020, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage offered guidance to local authorities that ceiling hoists should not be included in the Housing Adaptation Grant.

As Minister with responsibility for this area I have prioritised home support services so that additional funding secured in Budget 2021, to provide an extra 5 million hours, has been maintained under Budget 2022. In 2021 some 20.4 million hours were provided to over 55,000 people. This is about 2.9 million more hours compared to 2020, an increase of 17%.</p>  <p>  It takes some time between funding approval and the actual delivery of home support hours, and certain regions are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability.  At the end of January 2022 there were 4,836 people assessed and waiting for a carer to become available. This is a reduction from December 2021, when 5,322 were waiting for a carer to become available. At the end of January 274 were awaiting processing of funding approval, which is a reduction from  474 in December 2021, the previous month.  </p>  <p>  The HSE is endeavouring to prioritise service for clients with the highest care needs, to ensure that the service can commence for those who require it most urgently.  It is important to note that progress is being made in this area, and that the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to approximately 5,110 by the end of January 2022.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the strategic workforce challenges in the home support and nursing homes sector, and I have held multiple meetings with relevant key stakeholders in recent months on these matters.  I have also spoken about my commitment to establish a Cross-Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group to examine strategic workforce challenges, including recruitment and retention of workers, in front-line carer roles in home support and nursing homes.</p>  <p>  The Group is now established and held its first meeting on 3rd March 2022, following a call for submissions from key relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference for the Group are available on the Department&rsquo;s website: bit.ly/3IgjEko</p>  <p>  The Group will progress a structured programme of ongoing consultative engagements with stakeholders to further explore and define the issues, listen to stakeholder views, and identify approaches to respond to the strategic workforce challenges.</p>  <p>  The Group will also provide a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address the workforce challenges in the sector and develop a report for my consideration outlining the Group&rsquo;s key findings, recommendations, and a proposed action plan to support implementation of these recommendations to include periodic monitoring of progress.</p>  <p>  The Group is working to a tight timeline and is committed to providing a set of recommendations to me by September 2022.</p></reply>

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  In relation to the regulatory framework, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for homecare and support providers in April 2021. This is being progressed by the Department with a view to bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. The framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services. </p>  <p>  Development of regulations and quality standards are at an advanced level and public consultation on these draft minimum requirements is planned for Q2 2022. </p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health.

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p>  <p>  This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p>  <p>  In relation to the data requested by the Deputy regarding the number of patients that are currently on the waiting list for a DEXA bone scan at St Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital, Loughlinstown by one, three, six and 12 months, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Up to &euro;697m is provided in 2022 for net non-capital expenditure in relation to COVID-19 measures. Within this funding, &euro;497m is allocated for a range of public health and related infection prevention and control measures, including but limited to Testing &amp;amp; Tracing, Personal Protective Equipment and Vaccination programmes, with a further &euro;200m allocated to Waiting List measures.</p>  <p>  It is up to the HSE to allocate this funding across the relevant service areas as required throughout the year. In order to provide specific detail regarding the budget allocation and breakdown of same for the National Immunisation Office over the past four years, I will refer the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the HSE for direct reply.</p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.  My Department is guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence in relation to the immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  In terms of research in relation to evaluating social and economic benefits, it is usual that the Health Information Quality Authority are asked by the Minister to carry out a Health Technology Assessment prior to a significant change or the introduction of a new vaccine to the national immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  A Health Technology Assessment (HTA) systematically gathers evidence under a series of domains to assist the decision-making process. The domains typically included are the burden of the disease, clinical effectiveness and safety, cost effectiveness and budget impact and ethical and legal issues.</p>  <p>  A HTA may be repeated in numerous countries, as each will have its own requirements regarding cost and epidemiological data. However, some elements of a HTA, such as the assessment of clinical effectiveness, may be transferable across jurisdictions. HIQA is involved in a collaboration of HTA agencies in Europe (EUnetHTA) which has the express purpose of improving information sharing and reducing duplication of work. The sharing of work is facilitated by using agreed methodology and processes when carrying out HTAs. Whenever possible, HIQA uses work carried out in other agencies as well as making their work available to them also. </p>  <p>  HIQA is also involved in other international collaborations, such as HTA International (HTAi), the International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA), and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR). Through these collaborations, HIQA contribute to and benefit from the knowledge and expertise of a wide network of HTA agencies.</p>  <p>  HIQA are currently carrying out a HTA on the Varicella Zoster Vaccine, which is scheduled to be completed in 2022.</p></reply>

Taking place within the broader context of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, this work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  In relation to the regulatory framework, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for homecare and support providers in April 2021. The framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services. Development of regulations are at an advanced level and public consultation is planned for Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  On 24th February, the ESRI published a report on the demand for and cost of home support. This is the final output from a programme of research that the ESRI has undertaken to support the Department of Health to progress the development of the new home support scheme.  This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population.  Government approval will be sought in due course on any proposed legislation to provide for a financial support scheme, taking into consideration the cost associated with the various options. </p>  <p>  In addition, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a reformed model of service delivery for the new scheme. In 2021, funding was secured for the Health Service Executive to: (i) progress the roll-out of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community; (ii) pilot a reformed model of service-delivery for home-support; and (iii) establish a National Office for Home Support Services. </p>  <p>  The testing of the reformed model of service delivery Home Support Pilot is in progress in four pilot sites. Funding has been approved for 128 interRAI Care Needs Facilitators to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established. A comprehensive and robust operational model for the roll-out of the interRAI has been developed which will facilitate effective, efficient, fair and transparent care needs assessment and planning and appropriate service delivery. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme.</p>  <p>  Home Support services are delivered directly by the Health Service Executive (HSE) or through service arrangements with private providers. The HSE National Service Plan 2022 outlines that the proportion of public / private provision of home support hours will be maintained at a minimum of 40%, so that the provider balance is reflected in each area and any increases reflect the workforce requirements of the expected statutory home support scheme.</p>  <p>  Additionally, work has begun on the 2023 HSE home-support tender. A joint working group involving the HSE, and the Department of Health is in the process of being established to prepare the tender and ensure that it is in place from 1st January 2023.  As it is envisaged that the new tender will be in place before the statutory scheme comes into effect, the working group will consider options to accommodate this transition.</p></reply>

This payment will be made to those eligible public sector frontline healthcare staff (inclusive of agency staff working for the HSE) who worked in clinical settings (e.g. &ndash; and noting this list is not exhaustive: those Doctors / Nurses / Health Care Assistants / Porters / Cleaners etc. that work in clinical settings.) The Department of Health will also introduce a similar measure for frontline staff in all nursing homes and hospices (whether public, private, voluntary, Section 39 etc.). This measure will address the specific challenges associated with making payment to these organisations including governance and scope.</p>  <p>  The announcement covers eligible frontline healthcare workers only. I am also mindful of the many, many other workers throughout the country who played their own part during this difficult period. It is difficult to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which frontline healthcare workers faced. </p>  <p>  In relation to Death in Service for those who tragically passed away due to COVID-19 contracted while working in essential health and social care services, this payment only applies to a relatively small number of individuals. In order to treat these sad circumstances as compassionately as possible, the employment criteria have been specified broadly.</p></reply>

REAP incentivises farmers to maintain and improve the environmental condition of their land.</p>  <p>  While parcels brought into REAP may not be converted to forestry during the term of the REAP contract, afforestation is fully compatible with REAP. REAP participants are subject to a maximum land area of 10ha for individual farmers and 30ha for partnerships of three farm holdings. The average REAP area under management per participant is 8.4ha. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that REAP is not a whole-of-farm project and that afforestation opportunities continue to exist for REAP participants on parcels that have not been selected for the project. Of the 29 afforestation approvals in February, I can confirm that one of these was a REAP participant. </p></reply>

To date, my Department has received 574 applications covering 2,325ha and has issued 178 decisions for 575ha.</p>  <p>  The Forestry Licensing Plan 2022 was published earlier this year and deals with projected licensing output and approvals for support schemes and  may be found here gov.ie - Forestry Licensing Plan 2022 (www.gov.ie), A key target of the plan is to refocus on the delivery on approvals from the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) (Ash Dieback).  Many RUS applications  are screened in for Appropriate Assessment and are referred to ecology.  Of these, any that propose replacing the ash crop with conifer species currently require planning permission.  My Department is engaging with the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH), with the objective of removing the planning permission requirement for these files. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with their counterparts in the DHLGH, on progressing these files.</p></reply>

There are 5,200 ha in the system, which have a valid approval, but have not gone ahead to planting. We have written to applicants with unused licences to remind them that their licence is still valid and to encourage them to consider using them before their approval lapses.  </p>  <p>  Communication and positive messaging about the benefits of afforestation is also crucial. On most farms, planting can comfortably co-exist with livestock enterprises and can significantly increase the net income from the holding. </p>  <p>  Farmers who plant trees on a portion of their lands, can continue to engage in their traditional farm enterprises. They can also continue to receive their Basic Payment on planted lands, and will receive grants to cover establishment costs, generous premia over 15 years and substantial tax free income at thinning and harvesting time. </p>  <p>  We must also work together to communicate this positive message consistently, especially those in direct contact with farmers and landowners.. I look forward to working closely with foresters and farmers to do this.</p></reply>

I look forward to the Commission&rsquo;s detailed proposals in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) provided temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland, subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1132. BEAM was funded by a combination of EU aid and Exchequer support. It was provided to support Irish beef farmers who saw beef prices fall as a result of disturbance to the market.</p>  <p>  Some 10,342 BEAM participants, who opted for the deferred reduction period under the scheme, have now been processed and while 2,872 were found to have met the 5% reduction requirement 7,470 did not. BEAM participants agreed to the terms and conditions which stated that: </p>  <p>  &ldquo;where a penalty is applied, the applicant shall be required to reimburse the Department by the amount of the penalty, or the amount of the penalty may be deducted from subsequent payments being made by the Department, under any scheme, to the applicant&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  As the BEAM scheme was co-funded by the EU, under EU Regulations governing the accreditation of the Department as an EU Paying Agency, my Department is obliged to recover amounts unduly paid plus any interest at the earliest opportunity. The rate of interest is set by regulation at 3% per annum.  Any money still outstanding to my Department one month after the notification of the overpayment is subject to interest.  </p>  <p>  BEAM participants have been notified of this and have also been informed of the re-payment options available to them. Anyone for whom the recoupment of their BEAM payment will cause serious financial hardship can contact the Accounts Division of my Department to discuss extended repayment arrangements by telephone on (049) 4368207.</p></reply>

I am pleased to report that significant progress has been made.</p><p>All recommendations are actively in progress, with some completed,  and  I attach a table with a detailed update on each., I will take this opportunity to summarise progress  on specific items. </p><p>Significantly an end-to-end review of the licensing process has been completed  and recommendations arising from that review have moved to the  implementation stage. The  draft regulatory review of the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forestry activities was presented to the Project Board recently  and it is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.  </p><p>A pre-application discussion pilot for afforestation applications is in place since January, and we are currently seeking quotes for a training needs analysis focussed on the licensing system.</p><p>The forestry licensing plan for 2022 details a range of forestry priorities for 2022, the delivery of which will reduce the backlog. The consultation on the new Forestry Strategy is underway, with a public attitudes survey and a community engagement survey already completed while bilateral engagement with key stakeholders is well under way and an online public consultation opened on 16th March.  A deliberative dialogue is planned for May. </p><p>A more detailed update on progress under each of the Mackinnon recommendations is contained in the attached table.</p></reply>

There are derogations to this access rule, including restrictions on access to Member States' coastal waters.</p>  <p>  Last year, the European Commission published a proposal to rollover, for another ten years, the provisions relating to the restrictions on access to Member States' 6-12 nautical miles zones, as set out in the CFP Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 1380/2013).   </p>  <p>  I had sought that this issue be dealt with in the context of the CFP Review.  The matter of access to waters for fishing fleets is a sensitive issue and cannot be looked at in isolation.  We must consider the wider context, particularly in light of the drastic changes arising from Brexit which have transformed the way fisheries in the Western Waters region are managed, imposed disproportionate burdens on Ireland and changed the overall balance in the CFP.  However, the Commission views this as a technical amendment.  This means that the proposal is now moving ahead of the CFP review process.</p>  <p>  Last month, I secured Government approval to seek an extension of the 6 and 12 nautical miles zones out to 12 and 20 miles, respectively.  I believe that there is a strong case to be made to increase the protections for Ireland&rsquo;s fishing fleets in these waters, particularly against the background of Brexit.</p>  <p>  I have written to the Commissioner to advise him of Ireland&rsquo;s request and I have also written directly to my French colleague on the basis that France is most impacted and she is President of the Council at present. I will continue to engage with the Commissioner, fellow Fisheries Ministers and MEPs to seek to advance Ireland&rsquo;s case on this matter.</p></reply>

Applications for Aquaculture licenses are considered by my Department under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (amendment) Act, the 1933 Foreshore Act, and applicable EU Legislation.

The spreading of seaweed on land is therefore not the optimum use of such a valuable resource and, in its unprocessed form, is best used in other areas of agriculture.</p><p>However, certain scientific studies indicate that extracts of seaweed may have a potential role in enhancing nutrient uptake and use efficiency in crops, thus providing a means of reducing the levels of fertilisers that need to be applied. Seaweed extracts are classified as &lsquo;plant biostimulants&rsquo; and are described in EU Regulation 2019/1009 laying down rules on the making available on the market of EU fertilising products as inputs that stimulate a crop&rsquo;s natural nutrition processes thus improving the crop&rsquo;s nutrient use efficiency.</p><p>There are a number of products already on the market that provide such a function.</p></reply>

However, the parties involved did not submit a transfer of entitlements application to transfer the entitlements. Therefore, these entitlements remained with the original herdowner (the person named), and as no BPS was applied for by that person over a two year period, the entitlements reverted to the National Reserve in 2020.</p>  <p>  Secondly, no Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) applications were submitted by the new herdowner in 2019, 2020, or 2021. </p>  <p>  The person named was notified of the loss of entitlements through non-usage on 05/07/2021, and replied to this notification on 14/07/2021 citing health issues, but did not provide any supporting evidence. </p>  <p>  The EU Regulations governing the BPS state that all entitlements allocated under the Basic Payment Scheme (including the National Reserve) are subject to a two-year usage rule.  This means that each farmer must ensure that s/he uses 100% of their entitlements claimed at least once out of every two consecutive years.  Any entitlement that remains unused for two consecutive years will revert to the National Reserve and be lost permanently by the farmer. In addition, these Regulations are very clear about late applications and the reductions that apply to such late applications. Once 30 days have passed from the original closing date, the reduction is the full amount applied for and no funds will issue.</p>  <p>  My Department will contact the persons involved to discuss the matter and explore their options. </p></reply>

Animal identification systems in Ireland establish the location of animals, and the keeper responsible for the care of the animals. These systems are not concerned with the actual or beneficial ownership of animals. </p>  <p>  The rules on the identification and movement of terrestrial animals in the EU are contained in Commission Regulation 2019/426 (Animal Health Law), supplemented by its implementing and delegated regulations. In acknowledgement of the more varied purposes for which equines are kept, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/963 sets out the rules for ensuring the uniform application of equine traceability across the EU.</p>  <p>  My Department's Animal Identification and Movements (AIM) database encompasses the central equine database and records the required identification and movement data of bovines, ovines, caprines, porcines and equines, as determined by the relevant EU legislation. </p>  <p>  The Animal Health Law has introduced a requirement to record the premises where equines are habitually kept. In this regard, and in keeping with my ongoing commitment to review and enhance the equine identification and traceability system, my Department undertook the first annual equine census in November 2021. </p>  <p>  The data returned in this context is currently being compiled and will be used to establish equine herd profiles for equine keepers, for the first time linking equines to the premises where they habitually reside. Further development of AIM is planned to provide equine keepers with a facility to update their own equine herd profile directly as equines move in and out of their premises.    </p>  <p>  Separate to the animal identification and movement systems, S.I. 201 of 2016 was introduced to enhance the traceability of equines as they move through the life cycle. This requires that, where the ownership of an equine is transferred, the person to whom ownership transfers must provide the new ownership details to the relevant approved equine Passport Issuing Organisation. The PIOS update this information on my Department's central equine database.  It is expected that the formal linking of equines to their keepers via the annual census and the ongoing updating of habitual residence of equines on AIM will increase compliance with S.I. 201 of 2016.</p></reply>

The Appropriate Assessment procedures and subsequent mitigation measures in place today go beyond those envisaged in the NIS published at the end of 2014. </p>  <p>  Policy documents such as &lsquo;Environmental Requirements for Afforestation&rsquo; and &lsquo;Standards for Felling and Reforestation&rsquo; published in 2016 and 2019 respectively underpin my Department&rsquo;s approach to protecting European sites, giving a baseline of good practice helping to ensure that the conservation status of qualifying interests will not be adversely affected by the forestry operations being proposed. Publication of &lsquo;Forests &amp;amp; Water Achieving Objectives under Ireland&rsquo;s River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021&rsquo;, and &lsquo;AA Procedure Guidance Note &amp;amp; iFORIS SOP for DAFM Forestry Inspectors (2019)&rsquo; are other important documents that help the Department protect European sites. </p>  <p>  Geographic Information Systems (GISs) and associated technologies play a major role today in how my Department ensures that European Sites are protected when forestry operations are being carried out. This allows for all proposed projects to be assessed in terms of their proximity to European sites and their associated species and habitats. For example, Hydrological connectivity is assessed at individual site level and this assessment is aided by using the latest EPA GIS data which includes sub catchment data and rivers.  </p>  <p>  DAFMs mitigations in relation to the Hen harrier are based on a protocol agreed with the NPWS. Datasets identifying High Likelihood Nesting Areas are regularly updated by the NPWS and the Department is able to immediately update its QGIS systems to ensure that the appropriate measures are applied to the latest data on breeding Hen harriers in SPAs designated for Hen Harriers. Ecologists assessing files have access to this dedicated Ecological QGIS system. Other datasets available in the QGIS system include the Semi-natural grassland survey layer, non-designated hen harrier areas and curlew breeding buffer layer. OSI&rsquo;s  prime 2 water body dataset was also added to the Departments GIS system within the last 12 months.  </p>  <p>  My Departments&rsquo; data requirements for both statutory and non-statutory designated sites are subject to continuous review and improvement. This includes NPWS data which is updated regularly. Almost 90 amendments have been made to datasets used by my Department since the Forestry Programmes NIS was published in 2014. </p>  <p>  My Department has also strengthened its staff resource in the field of ecology, with a strong emphasis on Appropriate Assessment since the NIS was published. Currently, there are 36 ecologists employed by the Department where only one ecologist was employed by the Department when the Forestry programme NIS was written. There are over 40 Forestry Inspectors.  In 2018, the Forestry Inspectors and all Registered Foresters received Annex 1 habitat training, and further Habitat training is planned.  </p>  <p>  The SEA environmental report concluded that with the adoption of the listed mitigation measures it was anticipated that none of the effects identified as adverse in the detailed matrix assessment will be of greater than negligible significance and ensure that, even without adoption of enhancement measures, the overall effect of the Forestry Programme is strongly positive. In keeping with the SEA obligations, my Department undertakes monitoring in relation to the implementation of the Forestry Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 in relation to all sites and not just those designated as European sites. This monitoring is carried out inter alia in order to be able to identify at an early stage any unforeseen adverse effects and to be able to undertake appropriate remedial action.</p>  <p>  The monitoring programme is ongoing and includes the use of information collated in relation to projects approved under the programme. In this regard significant data is available on the Departments website including the Forestry Division Monthly reports detailing information about  afforestation, roads, woodland Improvement and Reconstitution and Underplanting of woodlands schemes.  Species composition is provided in the Forest Statistics Ireland annual publication also available on the Departments website. The Department&rsquo;s forest licence viewer provides access to view the location of public and private forests as well as proposed forests and proposed roads.  </p>  <p>  My Department also monitor information provided by other sources, i.e. from other existing monitoring and reporting arrangements arising from EU legislation other than the SEA Directive and from national legislation or policies, and which can be indirectly used for purpose of monitoring for significant environmental effects arising from the implementation of the programme. Also, the reports required under Article 17 of the habitats Directive on &lsquo;The status of EU protected habitats and species in Ireland&rsquo; and the implementation of the measures taken under the Habitats Directive are reported upon to the European Commission every 6 years. The latest report was published in 2019 and recognises &ldquo;the improved consideration of the type and location of planting&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The EPA are the national competent authority for the Water Framework Directive and associated implementing Regulations. The national Water Framework Directive monitoring programme for Ireland for the period 2019-2021, undertaken by the EPA is comprised of 3,169 surface and groundwater bodies. My Department is listed as a relevant public authority under the First Schedule of the S.I. and the Forestry Inspectorate, accordingly, actively engage with the EPA. The EPA waterbodies and High-Status Objective Waterbodies layers are provided to the Forestry Inspectorate by the EPA, and form part of the consideration of licence assessments. The most up to date layer on WFD status and pressures was provided to the DAFM Forestry Division as soon as it became available on 28th February this year, and is being added to the IFORIS system where it will be a central part of the licence assessment process. In addition, the Forestry Inspectorate participate on several working groups and committees established under the River Basin Management Plan for Ireland, including the National Technical Implementation Group, the Blue Dot Programme and all 5 Regional Operational Committees. My Department&rsquo;s Forestry Division is a participant of the largescale Waters of Life Integrated Project.</p></reply>

Walking trails that traverse private land are generally provided on a permissive access basis. Through the Walks Scheme, funding is provided to c. 2,400 landowners to maintain the trails. My Department is also considering a similar scheme for the uplands where landholders would receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken in line with agreed work plans.</p>  <p>  My Department has, for some time, been examining how best to introduce a scheme to indemnify private land owners in upland areas who allow permissive access to their lands for recreational purposes.  This is a complex issue and the legal rights of landowners must be considered and respected, while trying to facilitate access to their lands for recreational users on a permissive basis. My Department has been advised that an indemnity scheme would require legislative provision and that a number of separate pieces of legislation might need to be amended. </p>  <p>  In light of the complexities involved, my officials have been considering alternative pilot approaches, including an insurance solution, to address the matter on an interim basis.  Through this process, a public liability insurance policy was secured by my Department for the two Mountain Access Project areas, the MacGillycuddy Reeks in Kerry and Binn Sl&eacute;ibhe in Galway, which came in to effect from 13th August 2021. This pilot solution was developed in consultation with Comhairle na Tuaithe and is being implemented on a pilot basis. The policy represents a substantial step forward on this matter for landowners in the two Mountain Access Project areas involved. </p>  <p>  Other options around indemnity and potential amendments to the Occupiers' Liability Act are continuing to be explored and progressed as appropriate over the coming months.

My Department has recently provided an update to the Joint Committee on the recommendations outlined in the report as relevant to my Department. I have provided the updates requested on the relevant recommendations as follows:</p><p><b>Recommendation 50:</b>Greater supports should be provided to social enterprises - these could include a community asset transfer policy to enable community organisations and social enterprises to make a request for land and buildings from local authorities and other public bodies.  An additional funding stream should be established for CSP places for Traveller Projects particularly for new start up social enterprises. </p><p><b>DRCD response to recommendation 50:</b>Each year my Department provides funding for social enterprise from the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF). This year the available funding will again be &euro;2.3m. In 2021 DAF funding was used to provide small capital grants to 250 social enterprises, and 50 organisations received funding to develop programmes to raise awareness of social enterprise locally, regionally and nationally. 25 social enterprises also received funding under a start-up scheme for new social enterprises, and a training and mentoring scheme is providing support post-Covid for social enterprises nationwide. </p><p>My Department is now considering how the funding will be spent in 2022.</p><p><b>DRCD Response to recommendation 50 re Community Services Programme (CSP):</b>CSP) supports community based organisations to provide local services to disadvantaged communities and target groups, through a social enterprise model. The CSP focuses on communities where public and private sector services are lacking, either through geographical or social isolation or because demand levels are not sufficient. </p><p>Since the CSP was designed in 2006 emerging from the former Social Economy Programme, there have been major economic and social changes in Ireland. Therefore, when responsibility for CSP was transferred from the then Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to my Department of Rural and Community Development, my Department appointed Indecon International Economic Consultants to undertake an independent review of the CSP with the report published in September 2020, which contained 11 key recommendations and examined, among other things: </p><p>- options for expanding the range of eligible services and participants,</p><p>- how funding might be provided to a greater number of applicants,</p><p>- options for restructuring the scheme having regard to the range and scale of organisations supported by the programme, </p><p>- the scope to refine or expand eligible activities to strengthen synergies with other programmes, and</p><p>- the types and levels of CSP support.</p><p>The Indecon report outlines that service provision can help empower local communities and can directly assist in reducing social exclusion among marginalised groups.  Indecon recommends in the report that targets are set for the horizontal objective of the programme to achieve increased employment for disadvantaged groups, and acknowledges that there is a need to provide a greater level of financial support to organisations employing individuals from disadvantaged or marginalised groups who are more distant from the labour market, such as members of the Traveller Community.</p><p>Indecon also recommendations that rates of funding and eligibility criteria should be tailored to reflect variance in each sub programme area. For projects focused on enhancing social inclusion and support for sustainable communities, resource prioritisation should be informed by levels of social disadvantage. </p><p>My Department and Pobal are currently working on the restructuring of the programme, in collaboration with a Consultative Group, whose membership is secured from key sectoral stakeholders including CSP supported organisations, national organisations, community representatives and social enterprise representatives, with a view to having it finalised by end of 2022.</p><p>Pending the transition to the new restructured programme, the scheme is closed to new applications through the expression of interest process.  However, it is anticipated that the Programme will open calls to address identified gaps in service delivery in 2022. Funding for additional new entrants will be considered in light of available budgets, during the year. </p><p><b>Recommendation 51:</b>The Community Services Programme should be expanded with a particular focus on areas where there are a large number of Travellers living to give Travellers who are not employed or have not been employed a positive experience of employment. </p><p><b>DRCD response to recommendation to 51 re CSP</b>: The Community Services Programme (CSP) currently supports over 420 community based organisations to provide employment opportunities for specific disadvantaged individuals and to provide local social, economic and environmental services to disadvantaged communities and target groups, through a social enterprise model. The different types of services supported by CSP seek to address vital societal concerns such as inequality, marginalisation and deprivation, as well as contributing to healthy, safe and vibrant communities across Ireland.  </p><p>One of the objectives of the CSP Programme is to create sustainable jobs for those most distant from the labour market, in particular for those who are long-term unemployed and from specific target groups one of which is the Traveller community. </p><p>CSP guidelines mandate that 70% of all CSP-supported FTE contract positions (excluding managers) should be filled by individuals from designated target groups.  The current CSP Operating Manual references Travellers wherein it states that 70% of supported FTEs must be drawn from named target groups, one of which is &ldquo;Travellers in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s payments or One Parent Family Payment&rdquo; - this applies to all strands of the programme.  In addition to this, Strand 3 of the current programme (companies employing people who are distant from the labour market) specifically targets those most distant from the labour market and one of the named target groups for this strand is Travellers.</p><p>According to the information provided by the CSP organisations as part of the December 2020 returns, there were 69 CSP workers employed via 20 CSP supported organisations who self-identified as members of the Traveller community, the December 2021 returns are currently being collated. </p><p>Indecon International Economic Consultants undertook an independent review of the CSP on behalf of the Department. It recommends, in the published report, that targets are set for the horizontal objective of the programme to achieve increased employment for disadvantaged groups. It also recommends that the existing supports should be amended to provide a tailored package of supports reflecting the differentiated requirements for funding under each sub-programme.</p><p>My Department and Pobal are currently working on the restructuring of the programme, in collaboration with a Consultative Group.  It is planned that the restructuring will deliver a renewed and clearer vision for CSP that is aligned with the strategic objectives of the Department. It will also help the programme to maximise its impact in terms of reducing social disadvantage and building more sustainable communities.  In the interim, all existing CSP contracts are extended up to end December 2022 pending the transition to the new restructured programme, which is anticipated to roll out in early 2023.  </p><p><b>Recommendation 64:</b>Local Development Companies should take specific actions to increase uptake of programmes by Travellers that result in employment opportunities.</p><p><b>DRCD response to recommendation 64:</b>In relation to recommendation 64, the LEADER sub-theme of Provision of Basic Services Targeted at Hard to Reach Communities, already strategically focuses on improving access to basic services for people living in rural and remote areas and groups who are at risk of social exclusion. In some cases, it might involve the introduction of a new service or the re-introduction of a previously withdrawn service under the following categories; community, education/training, social/cultural and recreation. Examples of groups who may be at risk of social exclusion include, but are not limited to, those living in disadvantaged areas, those living in remote and less accessible areas, migrants/new communities and Travellers. To date, the LEADER Local Action Groups (LAGs) have approved a total of 9 Traveller related projects worth in excess of &euro;220,000. The overarching aim of these projects is to build the capacity of these individuals to enable them to progress on to existing mainstream education/employment or training services. </p><p><b>DRCD further supports under the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP 2018 &ndash; 2022):</b>The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP 2018 &ndash; 2022) is the Irish Government&rsquo;s primary social inclusion programme. It is funded by the Irish Government through my Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD) and co-funded by the European Social Fund. Travellers are named as one of SICAP&rsquo;s target groups.</p><p><b>Goal 1</b>: <b>Supporting communities:</b>SICAP provides supports to communities and target groups to engage with relevant stakeholders in identifying and addressing social exclusion and equality issues, developing the capacity of local community groups (LCGs) and creating more sustainable communities.</p><p>To date (2018-2021), SICAP has supported <b>93 Local Community Groups (LCGs)</b>that name Travellers as their primary target group.  This accounts for 2% of the total number of LCGs supported (4,844).</p><p>The types of supports received are as follows; support participation in community planning, support for social inclusion and equality issues, support to build capacity, support for participation in decision-making structures and support for initiatives addressing social exclusion and inequality.</p><p><b>Goal 2: Supporting disadvantaged individuals:</b>to improve the quality of their lives through the provision of lifelong learning and labour market supports</p><p>To date (2018-2021), SICAP provided one-to-one support to a total of <b>1,878 Individuals</b>who identified as a Traveller when registered with the programme.  This accounts for 2% of total number of individuals supported (86,641). The types of supports received are as follows; personal skills, wellbeing and capabilities supports, information about life-long learning opportunities, labour supports and ongoing in-work supports.</p><p>In May 2021 I, in my role as Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development &amp;amp; Department of Social Protection, wrote to every government Minister asking each to place particular emphasis on the disadvantaged situation of Travellers when putting forward their proposed measures under the 2022 Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF). </p><p>2022 DAF Allocations of &euro;55.5 million are approved. The Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plan 2022 sets out the 42 measures approved to be implemented across 10 Government Departments in 2022. Travellers Specific actions are 9,25,33,34,41 and the numerous actions which will assist travellers and others are outlined in the Action Plan. </p><p>As part of the Public Service Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy my Department is developing a Traveller Internship Programme. This will be a collaboration between the Department&rsquo;s HR Unit, a Programme area and a Local Development Company.</p><p>My Department has welcomed this opportunity to provide feedback on the above recommendations and it is my intention to continue to actively work towards increased supports for Travellers to assist in achieving full and equal participation in society. </p></reply>

The programme is funded under Project Ireland 2040 as part of &ldquo;Our Rural Future&rdquo;. The Scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the Scheme in 2016, almost &euro;113 million has been approved for more than 1,400 projects across the country. It has supported a range of activities from improving the public realm to initiatives such as the development of enterprise hubs and remote working facilities. These projects have been identified and developed by local community groups and businesses, in conjunction with their local authorities.</p>  <p>  The focus of the Scheme is to provide support for projects located in rural towns and villages throughout the country with a population, in the main, of less than 10,000 people. I do not foresee the Scheme being extended further into urban villages located in our cities.  </p></reply>

The response to COVID-19 has shown us the positive impact we can have by working together at local and national level.</p>  <p>  My Department is actively linking with key stakeholders at community level on an ongoing basis, including local volunteer centres, to provide information on the national response, support the co-ordination of immediate and ongoing integration and social supports provided through the local and community development sector, ensure complementarity with national and local government initiatives and enable flexibility in programme delivery to focus on the response. In this regard, my Department hosted a webinar with key stakeholders last week, attended by over 160 participants, to provide information, disseminate key messages and encourage communication and co-ordination. This was in addition to other meetings with relevant stakeholders in the sector. My Department and I will continue this engagement to ensure a cohesive and coordinated approach as the crisis develops. </p></reply>

The programme is delivered through Local Action Groups (LAGs) in each of the 28 LEADER sub-regional areas around the country. </p>  <p>  In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the area concerned, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme.  </p>  <p>  In this context, community and parish books may be considered eligible for funding under the LEADER programme.  However, decisions on the nature of the projects to be supported and the funding to be awarded are solely a matter for each LAG. </p></reply>
