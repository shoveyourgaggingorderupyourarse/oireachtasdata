The Deputy will wish to be aware that the Minister for Public Expediture and Reform on 25 May 2021 conveyed sanction for the implementation of the findings of the review. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the review, in the context of the agreement, was to rationalise existing technical pay arrangements and consider if the requirements could be met in a more cost effective manner. A review of Technical Pay Group 1 was conducted in 2014 and came into effect at the beginning of 2015. </p>  <p>  While the review of Technical Grades 2-6 was underway, the recommendation from the Public Service Pay Commission relating to the review which related to retention of personnel, was substantially different to the focus of the original review. The Public Service Pay Commission recommended that the review of Technical Pay Groups 2 - 6, be completed at the earliest opportunity, without compromising the Public Service Stability Agreement.</p>  <p>  An initial report (October 2019) and final report (January 2020) were completed and the approach to implementing the findings of the review of Technical Grades 2-6 was the subject of extensive enagement with the Department of Public Expediture and Reform. At the conclusion of that process the Minister for Public Expediture and Reform on 25 May 2021 conveyed sanction for the implementation of the findings. Discussions are currently underway with PDFORRA regarding the application of the recommendations and the process and timelines for implementation. </p></reply>

The associations that have since been established are RACO (for commissioned officers) and PDFORRA (for enlisted personnel). </p>  <p>  The scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration (C&amp;A) for members of the Permanent Defence Force provides a formal mechanism for the determination of claims and proposals from the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department continue to work with the Representative Associations in a positive and collaborative process within the C&amp;A Scheme to resolve issues. There is also ongoing engagement on a regular basis between the Official side and the Representative side on a range of items which are processed through C&amp;A. </p>  <p>  Since my appointment as Minister for Defence, I have met with the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (RACO) on three occasions: 17 July 2020, 20 October 2020 and 17 December 2020 and with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) on four occassions: 17 July 2020, 20 October 2020, 17 December 2020 and most recently on 24th May 2021.  I have also met with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association on one occasion on 23 November 2020.</p>  <p>  I look forward to further continued constructive engagement with the Defence Forces Representative Associations and I can assure the Deputy that I, and my Department, will continue to engage with the Representative Associations on all matters that fall within the scope of representation. </p></reply>

The Government also approved the Terms of Reference, based on the Programme for Government, and the membership of the Commission.  The Commission&rsquo;s overall approach will be guided and informed by both the White Paper on Defence 2015 and the White Paper Update 2019.  The work of the Commission will inform the future development of the Defence Forces. </p><p>As part of a broader consultation process, the Commission invited submissions from individuals and organisations on issues relevant to its Terms of Reference.  The Commission received over 500 submissions, a number of which have recently been published on their website.  </p><p>The Commission has been established as an independent body and, while it is a matter entirely for the  Commission, I understand that the Commission has met with a broad stakeholder group including the Defence Forces Representative Associations, commissioned and enlisted members of the Defence Forces, senior officials and personnel from my Department and the Defence Forces as well as other groups.  Site visits to Military locations by members of the Commission have already taken place and I understand that further site visits recommenced in June 2021 and will continue over the Summer if Covid restrictions permit.  </p><p>The Chairman of the Commission Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll also met with members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in April to discuss the on-going work of the Commission. </p><p>The establishment of an independent Commission on the Defence Forces underpins the Government's commitment to ensuring that the  Defence Forces are fit for purpose, both in terms of meeting immediate requirements and also in terms of seeking to develop a longer term vision beyond 2030.  The Commission is to submit their report by the end of the year and it will be considered fully at that time.  </p></reply>

The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 337 personnel and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria with 136 personnel. </p>  <p>  The UNIFIL mission in Lebanon continues to represent Ireland's largest overseas deployment and on 4 May 2021 the Government approved the continued participation of the Defence Forces in UNIFIL for a further 12 month period.    The Irish contingent serves as part of a joint Ireland/Poland Battalion, with additional officers from both Hungary and Malta.  The 118th Infantry Battalion deployed to UNIFIL during May on a six-month tour of duty.   The full cohort of personnel provided for as part Ireland's commitment to the joint Ireland/Poland Battalion, comprises three hundred and forty one Irish personnel and eleven personnel from Malta. </p>  <p>  In relation to UNDOF, Defence Forces personnel are currently based in Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the area of separation.  On 9 June 2021, the Government approved the continued participation of the Defence Forces in UNDOF for a 12 month period up to June 2022.  </p>  <p>  Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with 20 personnel; MINUSMA, the UN authorised operation in Mali with 14 personnel, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in Israel and Syria with 12 personnel, the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) with 2 personnel, the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) with 3 personnel; the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 5 personnel, the NATO-led international security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 13 personnel and the EU Naval mission (Operation Irini) with 3 personnel.   Ireland also contributes observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions and personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU, NATO/PfP and OSCE headquarters.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence constantly reviews the deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas.    With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests from time to time in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  Ireland has always been a strong supporter of the United Nations and UN Peacekeeping.  Our commitment and support for the primary role of the United Nations, in the maintenance of international peace and security, is expressed in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participating in UN peacekeeping operations.  This commitment is also expressed in our engagement in the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-29a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062900059#WRB01000"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) on Recruitment and Retention in the Defence Forces was published on the 4th of July 2019. The Report was accepted in full by the Government at that time and, to facilitate implementation, an extensive High Level Plan titled "Strengthening our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase One&rdquo; was also agreed and published on the same date.</p>  <p>  There are fifteen projects in total, the status of which is as follows.</p>  <p>  The immediate pay measures set out in the plan i.e. an increase in Military Service Allowance, the reversal of 10% cuts to allowances under the Haddington Road Agreement, and the restoration of weekend premium rates for overtime were implemented immediately upon their acceptance by the PDF Representative Associations in late 2019. A service commitment scheme for pilots was also re-introduced, with very positive uptake.</p>  <p>   On the project Review of Technical Pay Groups 2 &ndash; 6, sanction has recently been received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to proceed with the recommendations in the report. This will now be progressed through the Department&rsquo;s Conciliation and Arbitration Process.</p>  <p>   The Review of Pay Structures project, led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was intended to examine pay structures in the Defence Forces and to fall under the new public service pay agreement &ldquo;Building on Momentum&rdquo;. However, in the intervening period, the Commission on the Defence Forces was tasked with examining pay structures and also with some aspects of pay under the sectoral bargaining arrangements of this agreement. </p>  <p>  The recommendations of a further project dealing with incentivised long service arrangements for NCOs and other ranks, will be considered in the context of the sectoral bargaining element of &ldquo;Building on Momentum&rdquo;. </p>  <p> The project relating to Bespoke Management training for leaders and managers was completed in July 2020.  The project on Non-Pay Retention Measures in the PDF was completed in October 2020. The Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy was launched by me on 2nd December 2020.  A further project to develop a Professional Military Education strategy was completed in March 2021 and the Strategy will be launched by me in the very near future. The project relating to additional specialist posts for high turnover/long lead in appointments was finalised in April 2021.</p>  <p>   The report relating to the review of recruitment in the PDF has been completed and will be submitted for my approval imminently.</p>  <p>  Of the two outstanding projects, the project examining Barriers to Extended Participation in the PDF was split into two phases. Phase 1, focussed on reviewing mandatory retirement ages for Officers and is nearing completion pending clarification from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on a matter relating to pension rules.</p>  <p>   Phase 2 of this project, to examine the contracts of service for enlisted personnel, has commenced and is at an advanced stage. It had previously been agreed with PDFORRA that enlisted privates and corporals who had reached 21 years&rsquo; service, could remain in service until they reach age 50 until end 2022. Sergeants are also permitted to serve beyond 50 until that date. These measures gave this phase of the review scope to take place in an extended timeframe.</p>  <p>   The final project, looking at the embedding of strategic workforce planning in the Defence Forces has commenced and its work is ongoing. A detailed supply side analysis has been completed and the next phase, an examination of the demand side, will commence shortly. The work has been facilitated, to date, by an external HR advisor. As this is a long term project it will be progressed through the joint civil/military Strategic Human Resources Group. </p></reply>

A buoyant employment economy can also pose problems in the retention of highly trained and experienced Defence Forces personnel, as this training and experience makes them more attractive to private sector employers. </p>  <p>  The Government has fully acknowledged the recruitment and retention issues affecting both officers and enlisted personnel which have impacted operational capacity of the Defence Forces over recent years. In response, a range of actions have been progressed to address these issues. </p>  <p>  The report of the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) on retention and recruitment in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) contained a wide range of recommendations to address those difficulties and these have been progressed through the High Level Implementation Plan "Strengthening Our Defence Forces". </p>  <p>  Immediate benefits have included a 10% increase in Military Service Allowance; the restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of certain allowances and the restoration of premium rates for certain weekend duties. Members of the Defence Forces have also received the benefits of Public Service Pay Agreements with further increases available under the new Pay Agreement, should it be accepted by the Defence Forces Representative Associations.  </p>  <p>  Work has also progressed on a broad range of non-pay measures in line with the PSPC recommendations, including in workforce planning; enhanced professional military education; bespoke leadership training; development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy; a review of barriers to extended participation in the PDF (including the possibility of extending retirement ages) and consideration of the provision of additional specialist posts in certain areas.  </p>  <p>  A Service Commitment Scheme for pilots, introduced in 2019, has had a stabilising effect on Air Corp pilot numbers, with 25 officers currently participating.  A further iteration of the Scheme scheduled in 2021. A Naval Service Sea-going Service Commitment Scheme was also introduced this year with 77 applications so far received. A sea going naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270, which was applied in the 2020 tax year, has been extended for the 2021 tax year, and has been  increased to &euro;1,500. </p>  <p>  The introduction of schemes to allow for the re-commissioning of former Officers and the re-enlistment of former enlisted personnel of the PDF have assisted in addressing particular skills gaps and a range of direct entry specialist competitions have been initiated as a further means to fill critical positions. Furthermore, the upper age limit for both direct entry Naval Service and Air Corps technical appointments has recently been increased to 29 years.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that as part of the terms of reference of the Independent Commission on the Defence Forces, the Commission will consider and recommend appropriate turnover and retention approaches, having regard to work undertaken to date, and international best practice, to deliver the capabilities required of a modern military force.</p>  <p>  There is no quick fix to the challenges facing the Defence Forces today. Whilst there has been significant work undertaken to date, it will take time to see the full effect of the measures introduced. </p>  <p>  Working closely with the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff, and a range of key stakeholders, I am confident that the current challenges facing the Defence Forces can be overcome.</p></reply>

To this end, it is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised in any way. For this reason compulsory retirement ages for ranks in the Permanent Defence Force are considerably lower than in other employments. </p><p>The age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was an issue of serious concern during the 1990's and was the subject of severe criticism in a series of external reports such as those compiled by Price Waterhouse Consultants and the Efficiency Audit Group. One of the key areas identified for urgent action was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. </p><p>The White Paper on Defence (2015) states that retirement ages and/or upper service limits of Defence Forces&rsquo; personnel of all ranks will continue to be kept under review and determined in accordance with key considerations such as manpower policy requirements, operational needs and international best practice.</p><p>The High Level Plan - &quot;Strengthening Our Defence Forces&quot; provides for actions or projects to be undertaken to deliver on the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) recommendations. A project to consider options to tackle barriers to extended participation in the PDF (including the possibility of extending retirement ages for members of the PDF) is underway.  Civil and Military staff in the Department are considering these matters in the context of an ongoing review.</p><p>The Review will take into consideration the recommendations from an Adjudication in 2015, arising from a claim PDFORRA made through the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. It was agreed at that time that Privates and Corporals in receipt of Technical Pay Group 3 or higher may stay in service to age 50 subject to meeting certain specified criteria.</p><p>The Adjudicator recommended a further review of contracts of service for Line Corporals and Privates and Corporals in receipt of Technical Pay 1 and 2, recruited to the Defence Forces post 1st January 1994. The Adjudicator recommended that such personnel be allowed to continue to serve beyond 21 years for a period up to the expiry of the next two promotion panels, subject to them meeting the required criteria and not exceeding the age of 50 years during this period.</p><p>In 2019, a further agreement was reached with PDFORRA that all Privates and Corporals recruited post 1994, be allowed to continue in service to 31 December 2022, (or until they reach the age of 50), provided these personnel meet certain criteria, including medical grades and fitness tests, during the interim period. This agreement was subsequently extended to include Sergeants recruited to the Permanent Defence Force, post 1st January 1994, who can also continue in service to the same date, subject to their meeting agreed criteria in the interim period.</p><p>This agreement with PDFORRA provides for such personnel to continue in service beyond the timeframe suggested in the adjudication to allow for this review to be completed.  The rank of line Privates, which had not been specifically recommended for review in the adjudication, is also encompassed with this measure. These measures are in place to allow the review to take place in the extended timeframe.</p><p>I am advised by military management that as at 31 May 2021, the number of Privates and Corporals in receipt of Technical Pay Group 2 or less, who enlisted post 1994 and who have served or will serve 21 years or more by end December 2022 is 195.  <b></b></p><p>The Review will encompass consideration of the mandatory retirement age limits for Privates, Corporals and Sergeants, as well as senior NCOs. Proposals and recommendations arising from these deliberations will be discussed with PDFORRA on completion of the Review. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-29a.41.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062900059#WRB02300"><p>At the outset let me state that under international law other State's naval ships or vessels are within their rights to carry out a training exercise in Ireland's EEZ or to traverse the Irish EEZ. This is not in any way an infringement of our national territory. In this context it is not unusual for naval ships or vessels of other States to carry out training exercises within  Ireland's EEZ or to passage through this area. This would normally involve prior notification to Irish Authorities where an exercise was taking place close to our Territorial Waters but this is not a requirement. </p><p>While I do not have respsosibility for the protection of marine life, I am advised that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage have responsibility for implementation of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (Directive 2008/56/EC). This Directive and an associated Amendment and Decision (2017) are designed to ensure the achievement and maintenance of good environmental status and the sustainability of human activities within the marine waters of the EU using a set of 11 qualitative descriptors to do so. It should be noted that under Article 2 of the Directive there is the provision that the Directive &ldquo;<i>shall not apply to activities the sole purpose of which is defence or national security</i>&rdquo;, as would be the case for training by naval ships and vessels. </p><p>I am also advised that all cetaceans are protected under the EU&rsquo;s Habitats Directive and Ireland is required to report to the EU Commission on their conservation status every six years. Twenty-four species of cetacean have been recorded from Irish waters. </p><p>I acknowledge previously raised concerns, which were addressed by my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, around the impact on cetaceans in Irish waters from underwater noises and acoustic disturbance, including sonar. I undersatnd the hearing system of marine mammals is particularly susceptible to damage and the deep-diving beaked whale species are known to be especially vulnerable. I would direct further concerns on this matter to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage who has responsibility for the National Parks and Wildlife Service. </p><p>As Minister O'Brien's Department has noted previously, the use of sonar technology by naval vessels has the potential to disturb, displace and even kill cetaceans. However, Ireland is not a NATO member and the Naval Service does not currently employ sonar technology in its operations. </p><p>The Defence Organisation is supportive of the work of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage have a Service Level Agreement in place for the provision of assistance by the Air Corps to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, subject to availability and operational commitments. The Air Corps support the National Parks and Wildlife Service in areas including surveys of habitats and species, surveillance for protection of habitats, and occasional assistance with works requiring lifting into or from remote areas. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-29a.44.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062900059#WRB02500"><p>The Naval Service is the State's principal sea-going agency and is tasked with a variety of defence and other roles. In this context, I would highlight and acknowledge the security role of the Naval Service, a role which by its nature can go unrecognised or unacknowledged a great number of times. While the main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union, on any given patrol or patrol day the Naval Service can and do carry out a number of taskings on behalf of other State agencies such as the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners. The role the Naval Service plays in Ireland&rsquo;s maritime domain is of central importance. </p><p>The Government has acknowledged the recruitment and retention issues that are currently impacting on Naval Service operations. A range of actions have been taken to date to address these issues and further actions are currently under consideration. The sea-going service commitment scheme and an extension of a tax credit, both for sea-going Naval Service personnel, are examples of targeted measures I have introduced which are aimed at retaining experienced personnel. I can assure the Deputy that notwithstanding current challenges being experienced, the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including fishery protection and maritime security operations. My focus is on returning the Naval Service to its full capacity.</p><p>On the matters raised in the addtional details supplied by the Deputy the following may be of interest. </p><p>The Naval Service recently played a key role in tracking and identifying a fishing vessel which was carrying drugs that were estimated to be worth &euro;220 million. The vessel was intercepted off the Canary Islands after the Naval Service had brought the ship to the attention of Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &ndash; Narcotics (MAOC (N)) the EU anti-drugs agency. Ireland plays an important role in supporting EU efforts to disrupt drug trafficking into Europe and the Deputy may wish to note that the Defence Forces, in particular the Naval Service and Air Corps, just last week received the MAOC (N) Medal of Excellence. This award was presented by MAOC (N) to the Defence Forces for their role in assisting in the interception of Trans National Organised Crime vessels transporting drugs to Europe and I offer my sincere congratulations on this achievement. </p><p>On fisheries matters, I understand the Naval Service is working in close cooperation with the SFPA in relation to a re-emphasis of a risk based approach to fishery protection to better utilise resources - that is, delivering fewer boardings but boardings of a much higher quality. The success of this approach is evident in the number of detentions made by the Naval Service last year in 2020, a year when boardings and inspections were complicated by Covid-19 restrictions and mitigations. </p><p>The  patrol of the EFCA ship referenced in the Deputy's <i>article a</i>is a product of greater EU cooperation in the area of fisheries protection rather than as a result of Naval Service activity levels. It should also be noted that an EFCA ship has patrolled the Irish EEZ prior to this year in cooperation with both the SFPA and the Naval Service, the article was incorrect on this. The Naval Service liaised closely with the ship when it was operating in the Irish EEZ. The Deputy is advised that, in general, in relation to cooperation among EU Member States on the Common Fisheries Policy and fisheries protection, Ireland has the highest pre-commitment to EFCA Joint Deployment Days of any EU Member State. </p><p>I would also like to take this opportunity to mention that in the context of Brexit, the Fisheries Monitoring Centre, FMC, plays a key role in processing the required fishery control Prior Notifications for fishing vessels from 3rd (non-EU) countries fishing in the Irish EEZ and for Irish fishing vessels fishing in 3rd countries' EEZs. From 1st January this year the UK became a 3rd country in terms of fisheries control which has led to a considerable increase in Port State Control requests received by Ireland. I would like to commend the FMC for playing a key role in facilitating a smooth transition to this new way of doing business.  </p><p>The multi-faceted nature of the role of the Defence Forces in Irish life is an aspect of our Military that I am particularly proud of and this is a key feature of the Naval Service. </p></reply>

It is a standing item on the agenda of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning which I Chair where it is always a key topic of discussion.</p>  <p>  The response to cyber threats is a whole-of-Government challenge, with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications taking the lead role and with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, is the primary authority responsible for cyber security in the State, including incident response, cyber resilience and information provision. While the primary role of the Defence Forces with regard to Cyber Security relates to the defence and security of its own networks and systems, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the Cyber Security of the State. This is being done in line with the Programme for Government commitment to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy, recognizing the potential and important role of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  Department officials and members of the Defence Forces are actively involved in the implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy which, in conjunction with the White Paper on Defence 2015, will continue to inform our engagement in this critical area. This includes work to develop an updated, detailed risk assessment of the current vulnerability of all Critical National Infrastructure and services to cyber-attacks and the secondment of a member of the Defence Forces to the Cyber Security Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia. My Officials are also part of the steering group developing a Baseline Cyber Security Standard for Government Departments and Agencies, they participate in the UK-Ireland Critical National Infrastructure Cyber Cooperation Working Group and my officials also actively participate on the Inter-Departmental Committee overseeing the overall  implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have a Memorandum of Understanding and a Service Level Agreement with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to provide support in the area of national cyber security. The overall aim is to improve the cyber security of the State through various types of assistance and support while also ensuring the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are prioritised, including the ongoing sharing of information and analyses of risks. </p>  <p>  Regarding the major cyber-attack on the HSE, the National Cyber Security Centre in Minister Ryan&rsquo;s Department of Environment, Climate and Communications is the national response authority for cybersecurity incidents. The full resources of the Centre have been committed to supporting the HSE in its response to the cyberattack and the Centre is also liaising with international partners and third party contractors. This work has continued intensively since the incident took place with the focus on bringing the HSE&rsquo;s systems back online as soon as possible. I am pleased to note that the Defence Forces have also been part of the national effort to support the HSE.</p>  <p>  While it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specific cyber activities and the resourcing of same by the Defence Forces, for both security and operational reasons, I can inform the Deputy that the priority for the Defence Forces Communications and Information Services Corps is the protection of the Defence Forces Communications Network. DF Cyber capability is focused on Defence Networks and information systems, Incident Response and Resolution, Education and Capability Development, increasing Cyber awareness among DF personnel and Strategic Relationship Development. Also of note is that the Defence Forces have established a Computer Incident Response Team/ Information Assurance (CIRT)/IA section. </p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that the independent Commission on the Defence Forces is examining Defence Force Capabilities, Structures and Staffing in a number of areas and it is expected that a report will be produced for consideration by the Government before the end of the year.</p></reply>

Leadership Training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensure that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations. Skills Training ensures that Defence Forces personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills. Career Training, and education, provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels. Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces.</p><p>The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training required to meet operational output and capability development requirements. </p><p>The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms of the organisation against best military and academic practice. Military best practice is ensured by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and NATO/Partnership for Peace partners. Academic best practice is ensured by benchmarking courses through accreditation under the National Framework of Qualifications which is validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p><p>The Defence Forces deliver military programmes and modules meeting national and international standards and engage with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning. This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retain currency with regards to best international practice and employ all relevant modern training methods.</p><p>I remain committed to ensuring that all personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be trained to appropriate standards.</p></reply>

Irelands 3rd NAP on Women Peace and Security was published in June 2019 and covers a five-year period up to 2024.  Its implementation is overseen by an Oversight Group, which includes representatives from both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed, through its third NAP on WPS, to women&rsquo;s protection in fragile and conflict-affected zones and the prevention and combatting of all human rights violations against women, including Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Gender-Based Violence.</p>  <p>  In line with the NAP for the implementation of UNSCR 1325, the Defence Forces launched their own &ldquo;Defence Forces Third Action Plan for the Implementation of UNSCR 1325 and Related Resolutions&rdquo; in December 2020.  The third iteration of the Defence Forces action plan has three key priorities spanning the life of the plan, namely, </p>  <p>  a. reinforcing initiatives already in place whilst aiming to capture their effectiveness;</p>  <p>  b. the consideration of the effects of harmful masculinities and discriminatory gender norms;</p>  <p>  c. the development of Defence Forces processes addressing Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) and Gender Based Violence (GBV).   </p>  <p>  The  Defence Forces  WPS Action Plan commits to the comprehensive training of peacekeepers on the gendered impacts of conflict, increasing  the participation of women in peacekeeping missions, ensuring trained Gender Advisors are deployed to Peacekeeping missions and strengthening the gender responsiveness of the UN. The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces report on the implementation of these commitments to the Oversight Group for Ireland&rsquo;s national level plan.  </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are a member of the Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence (ICGBV).  The Consortium works in over 50 countries worldwide to prevent, mitigate and respond to gender based violence.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces have gender advisers in each of the military headquarters at home and gender focal points are appointed to overseas missions. The gender advisor in Defence Forces headquarters has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the implementation of UNSCR 1325 and related resolutions within Defence Forces policies, programmes and operations both on island and overseas.</p>  <p>  The promotion of a strong gender perspective is a key element in all our peacekeeping operations and is an integral element to improving the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping.  It is widely acknowledged that the presence of women contributes greatly in resolving conflict with local populations on the ground. It broadens the skills set available within a peacekeeping mission and provides role models for women, both at home and abroad. </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces is an inclusive, equal opportunity organisation that encourages participation of women at all levels, throughout the Defence Forces. </p></reply>

This meeting consisted of three main sessions; a working dinner on reinvigorating EU - NATO cooperation, a working session on the Strategic Compass (an initiative within the framework of the EU Global Strategy to examine key current and future threats in the context of the EU as Global Security Provider)  and a working session on the EU - Africa Partnership in Peace and Security. Defence Ministers also received a short Current Affairs briefing which touched on topics such as Mozambique and the Israel - Palestine situation. The working dinner was attended by NATO Secretary Genearal Jens Stoltenberg, while the EU - Africa session was attended by the Undersecretary General of the UN, Mr Jean Pierre Lacroix and a number of African regional development organisations.</p><p>The purpose of the EU - NATO session was to address security challenges that both organisations are facing, to discuss ongoing work in the framework of the EU&rsquo;s Strategic Compass and NATO&rsquo;s strategic reflection process (NATO2030) and to reflect on the upcoming fifth anniversary since the Warsaw Joint Declaration.</p><p>At the Strategic Compass session, Ministers discussed the Capabilities Basket of the Compass. The conversation focused on what capabilities are needed, how they may be developed and how we can embrace technological innovation to deliver highquality modern capabilities. HRVP Borrell highlighted the potential role of EU initiatives such as (CARD, PESCO, CDP, EDF) in delivering these capabilities.</p><p>With 10 CSDP Missions currently active in Africa across civilian and military spheres, the EU has a significant commitment on the continent. EU Ministers were joined by Representatives from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) as well as the UN Under-Secretary General Jean-Pierre Lacroix to discuss challenges to African<b></b>peace and security. HRVP Borrell emphasised the importance of finding &lsquo;African solutions to African problems&rsquo; through cooperation between organisations. </p><p>Ireland supports the strengthening of cooperation with our African partners, in order to further progress a mutually beneficial, mature and balanced security partnership with Africa. Ireland is also interested in finding ways to enhance AU-UN and EU-UN cooperation during our UN Security Council term.</p><p>In the margins of the Informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers I also met with the Under Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations, Mr Jean-Pierre Lacroix at his request. Topics discussed included UNIFIL, Security Council business, Action for Peacekeeping plus (A4P+), Women, Peace and Security, the UN peacekeeping ministerial meeting on 07-08 December hosted by the Republic of Korea, and opportunities for UN-EU partnership. </p></reply>

"A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution between the years 2004 and 2015 include: </p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006. </p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. </p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. </p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Custume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. </p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company was issued. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  In 2017, a specially commissioned medal &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; was awarded to all the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th   Infantry Battalion and the next of kin of deceased members, to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville in September, 1961. This medal presentation ceremony took place in Custume Barracks, Athlone on 2nd December 2017.  Custume Barracks was the location for this event as it is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.  The &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; has the word &ldquo;Jadotville&rdquo; depicted on the clasp of the medal and the medal ribbon represents a combination of an Irish tricolour and the United Nations Operation in Congo (ONUC) mission medal. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the range of  actions that have been undertaken to date, an Independent Review Group was established in December 2020 and in line with the Terms of Reference, the Independent Review Group will examine, report and make recommendations in relation to the &lsquo;Battle of Jadotville&rsquo; from 13 to 17 September 1961 and will report its findings to the Chief of Staff, as the convening authority. </p>  <p>  The Independent Review Group have been actively engaged in the consultation and research process and was originally due to conclude by 31st March 2021.  However, given the sheer volume of meetings and the comprehensive nature of the research process, an interim report was submitted and an extension to the timeframe for reporting to the Chief of Staff was requested.   I agreed to an extenstion and am expecting the final report along with recommendations from the Chief of Staff shortly. </p>  <p>  At this juncture there are currently no plans for a national ceremony to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville in September.  However, the Defence Organisation supports an annual Veterans Day and deceased members are honoured annually at the National Day of Commemoration and at individual ceremonies held in Barracks throughout the country. </p></reply>

This being said, the Defence Forces provide supports and services to the relevant Lead Department or Primary Response Agency on an as available basis as and when required. </p><p>In relation to on-island SAR, as I have already noted, the Defence Forces are not a primary response agency for non-security related emergencies, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, however they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department or Principal Response Agency, in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to Civil Authority (ATCA) role.  In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is made available for deployments, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises. </p><p>In relation to maritime SAR, since 2004 the Irish Coast Guard (IRCG) has had overall responsibility for the provision of SAR services within the Irish Search and Rescue domain. The IRCG fall under the remit of the Minister for Transport. From within the Defence Organisation, both the Naval Service and the Air Corps provide support to the IRCG in maritime SAR operations on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis. A Service Level Agreement is in place with the Irish Coast Guard setting out agreed roles and responsibilities in this regard. </p><p>In terms of the Air Corps' current role in the aviation aspect of SAR, at the request of the Irish Coast Guard, services currently provided by the Air Corps to the Coast Guard on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis include:-</p><p>- Search &amp;amp; Rescue, search support in a number of settings including the potential to act as on-scene air Co-ordinator if required,</p><p>- Island Medevacs when the IRCG are unable to respond,</p><p>- Maritime counter pollution patrolling &amp;amp; monitoring,</p><p>- Maritime surveillance,</p><p>- Air Deployed life raft tasks,</p><p>- Environmental escort duties,</p><p>- Representation on Committees, </p><p>- Partake in joint training exercises as required </p><p>- Emergency temporary accommodation at Baldonnel for IRCG helicopters in the event of extraordinary circumstances (subject to availability and security requirements), </p><p>- And technical advice as appropriate.</p><p>I have acknowledged in this House and in other fora that I would like to explore further the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the SAR aviation service, given their historical role in this area. I have confirmed previously that late last year I asked my officials to engage further with the Department of Transport, to explore the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the next generation SAR aviation service while at the same time ensuring that the service meets domestic and international obligations for search and rescue and represents value for money for the State.  </p><p>I have not been prescriptive as regards what model any potential SAR marine aviation service delivery  by the Air Corps could take. There is much to consider and exmaine, including legal considerations, as part of this process. Any future SAR capacity of the Air Corps will be depedent on the outcome of this process. Ultimately, decisions on the scope, nature and procurement strategy for the next SAR marine aviation service will be a matter for Government once the detailed appraisal and business case has been finalised by the Department of Transport. Should the Air Corps be assigned responsibility for some aspect of SAR marine aviation service then the requiremet for increased SAR capacity will be examined. </p><p>In addition the Naval Service also has roles in the maritime SAR domain.  At the request of the Irish Coast Guard, services currently provided by the Naval Service to the Coast Guard on an &ldquo;as available&rdquo; basis include:-  </p><p>- Search &amp;amp; Rescue/Recovery support,</p><p>- Accommodation of IRCG personnel onboard Naval Service ships as required,</p><p>- Towage in restricted circumstances,</p><p>- Escort supports, </p><p>- Enforcement of Exclusion Zones, </p><p>- Diving Unit Assistance, </p><p>- Technical Assistance and Support,</p><p>- Ship Casualty &amp;amp; Pollution Monitoring &amp;amp; Control,  </p><p>- Representation on Committees, </p><p>- Partake in joint training exercises as required. </p></reply>

Since publication of the White Paper, a total of 95 separate projects have been identified for completion over a ten-year period.  To provide flexibility, projects may be sub-divided or merged, changing the top-line number.  Project and Programme Management Governance arrangements were put in place to monitor the ongoing status of individual projects and to review the scope of projects within the programme.</p><p>Following on from the White Paper Update 2019 and the Government&rsquo;s High Level Implementation Plan to implement the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission, senior civil and military management have concluded a review of the projects which has resulted in reprioritisation of certain projects.  This takes account of work that is progressing across the organisation which has been contributing to implementation of the White Paper.</p><p>The review of progress on all projects has led to the approval of an updated White Paper Programme Implementation Roadmap.  Of the initial 95 projects, 47 are now formally completed and closed with an additional 3 in the closing process. The objectives and outputs of a number of these closed projects are now being addressed through the High Level Implementation Plan and its' associated projects, others are ongoing as part of the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s normal business processes. <b></b>A further 14 projects related to the Defence Forces Reserve will be considered post-Commission on the Defence Forces.  12 projects are currently active with a further 4 due to be initiated during 2021 and the remaining 15 projects to be initiated during 2022 and 2023.  </p><p>Work in certain areas will in its nature continue beyond 2025 in order to ensure that changes, improvements and actions envisaged in the White Paper are fully implemented and are embedded in the day to day business of the Defence Organisation.  Implementation of all of the projects is being carried out on a phased basis through the use of a project management framework with each being managed by a joint Civil-Military Project Team.

However, on a routine basis the Air Corps monitors and communicates with foreign military aircraft where such aircraft are flying in the airspace in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, where air traffic control is provided by the Defence Forces.  </p>  <p>  The IAA exercises Air Traffic Control responsibilities for an airspace of some 450,000 sq. kms comprising of both sovereign airspace and also airspace over the high seas, largely off the western seaboard. All air traffic, both civil and military, is monitored and controlled by the IAA in respect of this airspace and in line with ICAO rules it is normal practice for the IAA to be informed by the relevant State of any military flights operating in Irish controlled airspace.</p>  <p>  In answer to the Deputy's specific question of capacity to be aware of aircraft movements in our air space, it remains Government policy, as per the 2015 White Paper on Defence, that should additional funding, beyond that provided for in existing plans, becomes available the development a radar surveillance capability will be considered. Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence, reinforced by the White Paper Update 2019, as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  </p>  <p>  The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020 provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects to be advanced over the next five years.  The EDP includes reference to a primary radar project. Consideration of this project will be prioritised should additional appropriate funding become available. The overall priorities in the EDP will remain under review as it is progressively implemented and taking account of funding availability.  </p>  <p>  Acquisition of primary radar capability would have to be assessed against the significant investment of public funds, in respect of both the initial investment and the on-going operational costs, which would have to be considered alongside other spending priorities and the nature of the threats Ireland faces.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary resources available to them, including a modern and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides a Capital allocation of &euro;131m for investment in Defence equipment and barracks infrastructure and will enable continued investment in major equipment platforms.   The increased capital funding for 2021 builds on increased levels of capital expenditure totalling &euro;392m over the years 2018 &ndash; 2020. </p></reply>

While the Government remains committed to returning to, and maintaining the agreed strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, there are a number of factors, many of which are hard to predict, which will impact on the timeframe within which this will be achieved.</p><p>I have acknowledged that there are on-going challenges in the Defence Forces, and these have been well-documented. However recruitment is ongoing and has resulted in 228 personnel (including 210 General Service recruits) being inducted as at 31st May 2021 and further inductions are planned. General Service recruitment continues. I launched a recruitment campaign on 25<sup>th</sup>June, specifically targeting potential Naval Service Recruits.  The intention is to induct a further 80 Naval Service recruits and bring the overall  Naval Service induction target to 130 this year.</p><p>Initiatives that also play a role in restoring capacity and in boosting specialist&rsquo;s numbers include the campaign to re-enlist and re-commission former members of the Permanent Defence Force.  This initiative has resulted in 15 re-commissioned officers and 42 re-enlisted personnel in 2020 and, in 2021, a further 1 recommissioned officer and 15 re-enlisted personnel as at 31st May.</p><p>Furthermore, along with direct entry provision for Doctors, direct entry is also currently utilised in 8 competitions in the Naval Service for the recruitment of both Officers and 'Other Ranks', Defence Forces School of Music Instrumentalists and Air Corps Aircraft Technician. The latter competition, launched on 28<sup>th</sup>May and remains open until the 30<sup>th</sup>June, had attracted 39 applications as at 22<sup>nd</sup>June. </p><p>A sea-going service commitment scheme and a tax credit, both for sea-going Naval Service personnel, are examples of targeted measures I have introduced, aimed at retaining experienced personnel. This follows the reintroduction of a successful service commitment scheme for Flying Officers in the Air Corps.</p><p>The PSPC report on recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces made a range of recommendations with a view to addressing recruitment and retention issues and these have been progressed through a series of projects.  In addition, the independent Commission on the Defence Forces is tasked with examining a range of issues, including recruitment and retention.  </p><p>Increasing the capacity of the Defence Forces will take time. However, the challenges are being addressed and work in this regard is a priority for me and my civil and military management team.</p></reply>

The 2015 White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the RDF.  </p><p>The White Paper acknowledges that there may be professional skills that on occasion may not be readily available in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) and outlines an intention to harness specialist skills that members of the Reserve may have to better support the PDF. A White Paper project relating to a skills survey of the RDF was initiated and the completed survey provides an overview of the range of skills available within the Reserve.  </p><p>As part of the High Level Implementation Plan arising from the Report of the Public Sector Pay Commission on recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Forces, a Workforce Planning project is underway which will identify skills sets in the PDF and identify appropriate measures to address any such gaps. The skills survey already undertaken of the RDF will assist in identifying possible options to address gaps.  Options to underpin the engagement of members of the Reserve will be identified as the various stages of this work unfold. </p><p>The Government has additionally given approval for proposed amendments to the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2020, which will update Defence legislation relating to utilisation of the RDF. These amendments will enhance the role of the RDF by removing the current legislative restrictions on the activities they perform, including the restriction on serving overseas. The Report Stage debate relating to this amendment is scheduled for Wednesday 30 June. </p><p>The Independent Commission on the Defence Forces, which as the Deputy will be aware, is also expected to include proposals on the role and contribution of the RDF, including its legislation, the regulations governing the RDF, the development of the First Line Reserve (FLR) and whether specialists from the RDF should be able to serve overseas.  </p><p>The proposed amendments to the Bill, do not prejudge any possible recommendations from the Commission, but will facilitate the implementation of any recommendations the Commission may make, which would, of necessity, require legislative amendments.</p><p>A number of RDF members are currently engaged, on a voluntary basis and where personal circumstances allow, in authorised COVID-19 activities in a supporting role to the response of the Permanent Defence Force to the COVID19 crisis. In this regard, members of the Reserve served a total of 1,457 Covid-related days in 2020 with a further 505 such days served by Reservists in 2021, to the end of May. Members of the Reserve are paid in such circumstances and their support is welcomed.</p><p>Members of the Army Reserve (AR) and the Naval Service Reserve (NSR) are not employed or engaged under a contract of employment and are not employees <i>per se</i>.  Furthermore, service with the AR and NSR is not pensionable under the Army Pension Schemes. As members of the Reserve undertake activities on a voluntary basis, there are presently no plans to introduce paid leave or employment protection legislation in relation to their voluntary activities within the RDF.  </p><p>While the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020 has provided for employment protection for members of the Reserve when called up on permanent service, there are no plans to call RDF members out permanently.</p><p>While the primary role of the Defence Forces with regard to Cyber Security relates to the defence and security of its own networks and systems, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, including the RDF, are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the Cyber Security of the State. </p></reply>

The Working Group will analyse the range and cost of treatments currently provided to Officers and assess how best to provide this access to enlisted personnel. The Working Group is currently due to produce its report by the end of 2021.</p><p>At present, a wide range of medical services are provided to members of the Permanent Defence Force at State expense. These include: an annual medical examination, sick parades, attendance at GP surgery outside of sick parade and out of hours GP services, prescription services, laboratory services, physiotherapy, chiropody, radiology, ophthalmic examinations, mental health services provided by a psychiatrist and two psychologists, in-patient and outpatient public hospital charges and routine dental treatment. In addition, commissioned Officers and members of the Army Nursing Service can avail of private consultant appointments and diagnostic tests, and private/ semi-private hospital treatment dependent on rank. </p><p>In the case of Defence Forces personnel assigned to longer term overseas administrative posts (e.g. EUMS, OSCE), these personnel, and any accompanying dependents are provided with global comprehensive medical insurance for which a formal arrangement is in place with a health insurance provider. This involves the organisation paying the difference between a basic minimum payment and the cost of the global plan.  </p><p>The provision of this range of benefits is unique in the public and indeed the private sectors and these benefits are exempt from benefit-in-kind taxation.</p></reply>

The White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the RDF and confirms that its primary role is to augment the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) in crisis situations.</p><p>The strength of the Reserve Defence Force, as of 31 May 2020, is set out below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Service </th>       <th>Total Effective Personnel</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Army Reserve</td>       <td>1433</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Naval Reserve</td>       <td>122</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>First Line Reserve</td>       <td>262</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>While the Government remains committed to restoring the strength of the RDF, the capacity to induct and train recruits has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><p>The same personnel and resources are utilised for both PDF and RDF recruitment.

The minimum salary scale point for Assistant Director General, with effect from 1 October 2020, is &euro;135,299 for those appointed to the Civil Service before 6th April 1995; and &euro;142,421 for those appointed on or after 6th April 1995 paying the Class A rate of PRSI contribution and making an employee contribution in respect of personal superannuation benefits for General Service grades (PPC).</p><p>The minimum salary scale point for the Senior Statistician grade, with effect from 1 October 2020, is &euro;84,752 (for those serving before 6th April 1995) and &euro;89,072 (PPC).

Official expenses incurred in the course of duty (e.g. official travel and subsistence) are paid in accordance with Civil Service policies and circulars. Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 13/2019 sets out the domestic subsistence rates as of 1st July 2019 and Circular 07/2017 outlines subsistence allowances abroad. </p><p>Recruitment at Assistant Director General level is carried out through the Top Level Appointments Committee (TLAC) and recruitment costs are met through this process. Recruitment at Senior Statistician level is managed either via open competition through the Public Appointments Service (PAS) or internal competition within the CSO, and related recruitment costs are met from within the respective annual administrative budgets.</p></reply>

The Strategy is built on three pillars which are bolstered by underpinning conditions. These pillars are:</p><p>1. Create a Conducive Environment </p><p>2. Develop and Leverage a Remote Work Infrastructure</p><p>3. Build a Remote Work Policy and Guidance Framework</p><p>My Department has developed the Guidance for Working Remotely webpage (<i>enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Remote-Working/Guidance-for-working-remotely.html</i>) to facilitate remote working arrangements. The webpage acts as a central access point for employers and employees and brings together the existing State guidance, legislation and advice on remote work into one place. The webpage also includes an employer checklist to provide employers with a quick way to navigate the adoption of remote working arrangements if these are appropriate for their business. </p><p>Under these pillars and the underpinning conditions there are 15 actions to progress remote working into the future.  The Strategy outlines the Departments and State Agencies responsible for the delivery of each of the actions. Each of these actions has a deadline of Q1, 3, or 4 of this year. </p><p>My Department is leading on the implementation of the Strategy. Lead actors report the progress on their actions to the Interdepartmental Group on Remote Work. This Group has met twice to date this year, with the most recent meeting taking place on May 27<sup>th</sup>.  At this meeting it was established that actions to date have been met and that progress is underway to achieving the remaining actions by the end of the year. The Group will continue to meet as the year progresses to drive the implementation of the Strategy.</p><p>As part of the Strategy, on 1 April I signed a new Code of Practice giving all employees the Right to Disconnect. This was effective immediately from that date. A public consultation on the Right to Request Remote Working has concluded and legislation is expected later this year.</p></reply>

The WRC&rsquo;s primary functions include the inspection of employment law compliance, the provision of information on employment law, mediation, adjudication, conciliation, facilitation, and advisory services.</p><p>It is the policy of the Workplace Relations Commission to work with employers in order to achieve compliance and, where relevant, pay any unpaid wages arising from contraventions so that workers achieve their entitlements as a result of our inspection. Prosecution proceedings are initiated in the case of offences under the Employment Permits Acts and, in the case of offences under employment legislation, where the employer has failed to respond to the Inspectors intervention, failed to comply with a compliance notice or a fixed payment notice and/or failed to achieve compliance by granting workers their entitlements. In 2020, across all regions, prosecution proceedings were required to be initiated in less than 2% of cases in which contraventions were detected.</p><p>I understand from clarification provided by the Deputy that the information sought relates to the number of prosecutions initiated by the WRC Inspectorate in Cork in 2020 and to date in 2021.

It was designed to help businesses with fixed costs associated with running a business e.g rent, utilities, security etc. </p><p>Phase 1 of the scheme was available to companies, self-employed, sole traders or partnerships, with less than 250 employees, operating from a rateable premise with a minimum turnover of &euro;50,000 for a pre-defined period.  Phase 1 of the Scheme opened for applications on the 11<sup>th</sup>March 2021 and closed on the 21<sup>st</sup>April 2021.  Eligible businesses for Phase 1 received a payment of &euro;4,000 in 2021.</p><p>Phase 2 of SBASC, which was launched in June 2021, was extended to include businesses operating from non-rateable premises e.g home, hot desking hub etc.  There are now two grants available, those with a minimum turnover of &euro;50,000 will receive a payment of &euro;4,000 and those with minimum turnover of &euro;20,000 and less than &euro;49,999 will receive a payment of &euro;1,000.  Both of these changes can give support to those who are not eligible for EWSS.  Phase 2 of SBASC will close to applicants on 21st July 2021.  Interested applicants can find more information on their local authority website. </p><p>Eligible microenterprises can access lending through Microfinance Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Loans with zero repayments and zero interest for the first six months and the equivalent of an additional 6 months interest-free subject to certain terms and conditions. The loans can range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000. Repayments will commence in month seven for the remaining period of your loan.  The Government will rebate to you the interest paid in the following six months (months 7-12 of your loan).</p><p>Additional advice and support for self-employed sole traders may be available from the Local Enterprise Offices.  I would urge business owners to contact their Local Enterprise Office who can signpost them and advise them of supports that may be available for their business.  More general information on all COVID business support schemes run by my department is available here:</p><p>Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses - DETE (<i>enterprise.gov.ie</i>)</p><p>There are also additional schemes for self-employed people which were developed and are administered by the Department of Social Protection.  More information about these schemes is available at:</p><p>gov.ie - COVID-19 Social Welfare Schemes available to a self-employed person (<i>www.gov.ie</i>).</p></reply>

IDA Ireland is committed to the pursuit of more balanced, compact regional development which can deliver complementary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development. The IDA will target half of all investments (400) from 2021- 2024 to regional locations and maintain the same high level of investment as targeted in IDA&rsquo;s previous strategy for each region of the country.</p>  <p>  Cork and Kerry make up the South West Region and has 211 client companies which collectively employ 46,009 people, while Clare and Limerick (along with Tipperary) are included in the Mid-West Region with 131 client companies employing 19,989 people.</p>  <p>  The primary responsibility of the IDA is to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Ireland and to retain, transform and expand the existing base of client companies that have already invested and located here.  </p>  <p>  When it comes to FDI site visits represent a valuable tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas.  Site visit activity, however, does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies.  </p>  <p>  2020 presented undeniable challenges to IDA's ongoing efforts to sustain and grow FDI in Ireland. The introduction of travel restrictions around the world disrupted the usual way the IDA engaged with investors, resulting in fewer numbers of site visits and client meetings. The pandemic also impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.</p>  <p>  In response to this, IDA Ireland migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities onto digital platforms and established a suite of digital content which can be accessed by potential investors.  The use of these digital platforms has contributed to an enhanced digital engagement with existing clients, and in hosting E-Site visits with potential new investors.  </p>  <p>  The number of site visits, including E-visits, to end Q1 2021 was: Limerick 8; Clare 4 and Cork 3. There were no site visits to Kerry during Q1, though I understand in June 2021, IDA Ireland organised a virtual site visit for a US company showcasing Kerry for a potential project. Verified figures for end Q2 2021 are expected next month. It should also be noted that potential clients visiting Ireland may visit more than one county and may return to a location more than once. These figures represent individual visits and are therefore not indicative of the number of companies that have visited.</p>  <p>  As part of the IDA&rsquo;s Strategy Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021-24, IDA have set out proposed office solutions for regional locations, which will enable the IDA to attract further FDI to these locations. For example, in the South-West region IDA will deliver an Advanced Building Solution in Tralee over the life of the Strategy, while continuing to work closely with the private sector in the South-West to secure the provision of appropriate and cost-effective building and property solutions for client companies.  Additional upgrade works, and investment are planned for IDA Parks in the region to ensure a robust value proposition for clients, and IDA plans to acquire additional strategic sites for future development. IDA will target 118 investments for the South-West region in the period 2021-2024.  In the Mid-West Region it is planned to deliver an Advanced Building Solution in Limerick, complete construction of the Advanced Manufacturing Centre in Limerick and undertake further upgrade works for IDA Parks in the Region. </p>  <p>  The final decision on where to locate an investment is always decided by the client and not by IDA Ireland.   Regular engagement and collaboration with stakeholders are important in positioning any regional location to attract FDI and in this respect IDA Ireland continues to engage with Stakeholders as well as working with existing clients in all regional locations to sustain and generate additional jobs.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Terms of Reference for the Shannon Estuary Taskforce, encompassing parts of north Kerry and other areas mentioned in his question, are being finalised and I hope to make an announcement in that regard shortly.</p></reply>

The WRC&rsquo;s primary functions include the inspection of employment law compliance, the provision of information on employment law, mediation, adjudication, conciliation, facilitation, and advisory services.</p>  <p>  The WRC is independent in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function and I have no direct involvement in its day-to-day operations. However, I am informed that the WRC has scheduled 1,601 hearings from 6 April to 22nd June 2021. Out of this number, under 20% have been adjourned due to the adjudication officer concluding that it is necessary to adjourn to facilitate an oath/affirmation to be administered. </p>  <p>  There are a range of outcomes that may arise when hearings are scheduled; they may be postponed prior to the hearing date, the hearing completed, the issues case managed to reduce the matters to be dealt with if adjourned, they may be part-heard requiring them to be rescheduled at a later date, they may settle prior to, or during the hearing, leading to the withdrawal of complaints. The WRC is scheduling more cases each week than pre-Covid as it moves to proactively address any build-up of cases arising from the pandemic and the Supreme Court judgment which requires the introduction of legislation. The WRC continues to encourage parties to avail of its Mediation services.</p>  <p>  Following delivery of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Zalewski case and the consequential orders made on 15 April 2021, a number of changes were required to procedures at the WRC. The WRC has set out the revised procedures in its website notice on the Supreme Court judgment. My Department has received approval of the Government for priority drafting of necessary amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 2015, and other related Acts, to remedy the aspects of the Act that were found to be incompatible with the Constitution. The amendments concern the principle that justice is to be administered in public and the statutory administration of an oath with an offence of perjury for giving of false evidence.  Government has approved publication and the Bill is being moved through the Houses in the coming weeks. It is expected that it will be enacted in July. </p></reply>

The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p><p>I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 17 June, over 226,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed. Surveys are complete or underway in County Mayo in Aghagower, Ballyhean, Breaghwy, Burren, Castlebar, Clogher, Cloonkeen, Croaghmoyle, Islandeady, Killavally, Manulla, Pontoon, Strade, Tawnynagry, Turlough, Drumsheen, Bunnyconnellan, Ballina Town, Carrowntreila, Ardagh, Campbells Crossroads, Rosserk, Shanvoley, Derryhick, Kilhale, Tawnylaheen, Turlough, Ballyvary, Keeloges, Castlebar Town, Rinnaseer, Bellaburke, Killawullaun Mountain, Carn, Carnacon, Ballyglass, Belcarra, Balla, Newport, Carrowbeg, Inishgort, Inishcottle, Myna, Fahy, Ashbridge, Glenisland, Srahmore, Glenhest, Comploon, Slogger and Tawnameeltoge. </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Mayo through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 17June, 325 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are connected at Bofeenaun Community Centre, Taugheen Community Centre, Kilmovee Community Centre, Belderrig Community and Research Centre, Clare Island Community Centre, Keel Community Centre, Killaser Community Centre, Islandeady Community Centre, Finny Community Centre, Cushlough Community Centre and The Black Tom Freeman Sport and Community Amenities Centre (8.63km from the premises referred to in the Question). Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>Scoil N&eacute;ifinn, Midfield National School, Meelick More National School, Kinaffe National School, Gortskehy National School, Facefield National School, Errew National School, Cloghans National School, Shraigh National School, Rathbane National School, Rathnamagh National School, Dooagh National School, Valley National School, Dookinella National School, Tavraun Central National School and Saint Coleman's National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at .  </p></reply>

In this regard the Regional Waste Management Planning Offices, with support from my Department, have recently published a National Review of Civic Amenity Sites, which is available online at  <i>www.southernwasteregion.ie/content/national-review-civic-amenity-sites</i>.</p><p>Discussions have commenced with the local authority sector on implementation of the report recommendations.  This will allow civic amenity sites to play a greater role in our transition to a more circular economy through measures such as coordinated education and awareness programmes, greater use of reuse schemes, standardising a list of waste streams accepted at such sites and collective approaches to extended producer responsibility (EPR) schemes, and will assist in continuing to reduce the amount of waste disposed of to landfills.</p><p>In addition the <i>Waste Action Plan</i>contains a commitment to revisit the existing national standardised recycling list of items accepted in the household mixed dry recyclable bin with a view to capturing more recyclable material, including soft plastics. My Department officials are currently working to advance this commitment and I look forward to making an announcement in relation to this in due course.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for the collation of national waste data and reports annually on Ireland&rsquo;s performance against the targets set out in EU and national legislation.  Reports indicate Ireland is achieving or is on course to achieve all our EU waste targets. Further information is available at <i>www.epa.ie/our-services/monitoring--assessment/waste/national-waste-statistics/</i>.</p><p>The Government wants to build on this strong performance. <i>A</i><i>Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy</i>represents a step change in our approach to waste in Ireland, as it shifts the focus away from management to a fuller reconsideration of how we use resources and materials.  The measures in the Plan are intended to minimise the amount of waste generated, eliminating waste before it can be created and diverting as much as possible to beneficial reuse or recovery and will help us deliver on our national targets. </p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State Intervention Area covered by the NBP  as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.</p><p>Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to make sure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, my Department has raised the matter with the service provider operating in the area and my Department will revert to the Deputy as soon as a response is received</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. The approximate average value of the energy efficiency measures provided to households under the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme was &euro;14,800 in 2020.   A total of &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided for SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes in 2021. Of this amount, &euro;109 million is provided to support lower income households to retrofit their homes, with &euro;100 million allocated to the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme.  This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation for energy poverty schemes and means that almost half of the total SEAI residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty.  The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  There are currently over 7,800 homes on the Warmer Homes work programme and the scheme operates nationally on a first come, first served basis. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2020, the average time from application to completion was approximately 18 months. The average wait times are expected to increase significantly in 2021 due to the extensive COVID-19 public health restrictions on construction activity in 2020 and between January and April 2021 of this year when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  Works under the scheme have since recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector. </p>  <p>  Individual applications to the Warmer Homes Scheme are an operational matter for the SEAI and as Minister I have no role in such matters. However in reference to the case raised by the Deputy, I have been informed by the SEAI that the application for the home in question is awaiting an initial survey call and that the SEAI call centre will be in contact with the applicant within the next week to discuss the next steps. </p></reply>

The designation required eir to provide printed directories on demand rather than mass printing and production. This obligation ceased on 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  I understand that the decision was based on ComReg&rsquo;s view that the obligation to continue to provide printed directories could not be justified in light of the alternative methods available for the sourcing of phone numbers, in particular the availability of an online directory of subscribers service (currently provided commercially by eir) and taking into account the low level of demand for the printed phonebook directory in 2019. </p>  <p>  ComReg has also moved to ensure that the accessible directory enquiries service can be availed of by disabled-end-users who cannot access an online directory because of a disability. If a member of the public is unable to use the online phonebook due to an accessibility requirement, they can register for free directory enquires service by dialing 196. ComReg will continue to monitor and evaluate the online service provided by eir at: www.eirphonebook.ie</p></reply>

The CRU was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity sector following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 and subsequent legislation. The CRU is an independent statutory body and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. As Minister, I therefore have no function in this matter. It is a function of the CRU to regulate the electricity market.  </p><p>The charges raised by the Deputy are set out in Part 3 of the ESBN Statement of Charges document available at <i>www.esbnetworks.ie/docs/default-source/publications/approved-statement-of-charges-2020-2021.pdf?sfvrsn=224533f0_69</i>. These charges are set under CRU regulatory oversight as set out at <i>www.cru.ie/wp-content/uploads/2004/07/cer04300.pdf</i>. In rural areas the length of the of the network per customer is relatively high and consequently it costs more to install, maintain and operate than in areas with a higher density. Additionally, the Deputy may wish to note that CRU provide a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them to raise day to day questions on regulatory matters directly to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

Development of this programme is being informed by feedback received through the recent climate conversations that took place at local level across the country. Information on the types of projects that may be supported, who may apply for this support, and the application process, will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website when the programme is launched shortly. </p>  <p>  In relation to eligibility of nature based solutions for funding, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021, which was recently passed by the D&aacute;il and is currently before the Seanad,  includes provisions to allow certain nature based solutions to be eligible for support from the Fund.  Following commencement of the new legislation, it is envisaged that relevant nature based projects and initiatives will be eligible for support under this community programme.</p>  <p>  In advance of the finalisation of the community programme, Creative Ireland, in collaboration with my Department, launched Creative Climate Action, a competitive fund of up to &euro;2 million supported by the Climate Action Fund and the Creative Ireland Programme.  The fund will support creative and cultural projects that connect people with the profound changes that are happening in our environment, society and economy arising from climate change. Applications for support from this fund are now closed. The 166 applications received are currently being evaluated. Further information is available at www.creativeireland.gov.ie.</p></reply>

I have met with taxi unions twice in the past year. Other Ministers have also met with taxi driver representatives; the Taoiseach met with them last month and the T&aacute;naiste met with them late last year. I have also met twice with the Advisory Committee on Small Public Services (SPSVs), a statutory committee established under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 to advise the Minister and the NTA in relation to the SPSV sector. The Committee's membership represents a broad range of interests with four positions held by SPSV drivers.</p>  <p>  I know from this engagement how badly the SPSV industry has been affected by COVID-19. That is why drivers have been able to avail of the Government&rsquo;s wide-ranging portfolio of horizontal economic supports. Drivers are able to avail of the PUP, which has been extended to February 2022. Drivers can also earn up to &euro;980 in a given eight week period, net of expenses, while still receiving the payment, a measure that will become increasingly important to drivers as society reopens and passenger demand returns. This has been supplemented by targeted measures to address the costs faced by drivers which cannot be easily suspended or deferred. &euro;15 million has been allocated to grants towards the purchase of electric vehicles. Standard licence renewal fees for 2020 were waived and will be waived again in 2021. A scheme will also be established to refund NCT and Motor Tax for SPSV operators for a 12 month period. The NTA will administer these refund schemes and further details, including the commencement date and how to apply, should be available during the third quarter of this year.  </p></reply>

All traffic signs must be in conformance with the Traffic Signs Manual.</p>  <p>  The existing edition of the Traffic Signs Manual, which was updated in 2019,  provides guidance to road authorities on the design and implementation of signage and includes provision for warning signs indicating the possibility of animals on the road, including Accompanied Horses. There are no plans at present for the creation of signage to show that a distance of two metres is needed between a driver and a horse to pass at a safe distance. </p>  <p>  The Rules of the Road require that drivers should always take other users of the road into account and look out for pedestrians, cyclists and animals. While traffic signs play an important part in contributing to road safety, signs are only effective when deployed in a consistent and strategic manner.

Department officials are currently working on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation as part of the forthcoming Road Traffic Bill.</p>  <p>  To permit the safe use of e-scooters on public roads, it is intended to introduce a new category of vehicle - powered personal transporters. Once the new category has been defined, these vehicles can be incorporated into the existing legislative framework, where a range of powers and offences already exist. This will permit regulation for the use of and standards for different types of powered personal transporters, including technical specifications such warning and and safety requirements. As these vehicles will not be classed as mechanically propelled vehicles, it is not currently intended that they be subject to road tax or that insurance will be mandatory, although users may take out private insurance and will be strongly encouraged to do so. However, it should be noted that these matters have not yet been finalised.</p>  <p>  In addition, the existing powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in road traffic legislation concerning offences such as careless or dangerous driving, driving under the influence of an intoxicant or driving an unroadworthy vehicle, can be extended to users of powered personal transporters where required.</p></reply>

The sector has availed of some of those central Government supports such as the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme, which has undoubtedly helped sustain employment in the sector.  Travel agents and tour operators have also qualified for the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) or the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID (SBASC) which fall under the remit of my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment respectively.</p>  <p>  In addition, in June 2020 my Department, in close consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, introduced the Refund Credit Note (RCN) Scheme, which has assisted the liquidity positions of licensed travel agents and tour operators by ensuring that refund vouchers are protected in the event of insolvency. The Scheme has undoubtedly assisted in preserving cash within the sector, to date Notes to the value of &euro;17m have been issued. This is money that otherwise would have had to be paid by the sector at the height of the crisis to cover customer refunds at a time that their onward suppliers were not releasing refunds. However I understand that situation has regularised in recent months.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the pandemic I have maintained contact with relevant Government colleagues in respect to the needs of this sector, in particular from a small business perspective about the eligibility criteria for certain COVID related business support schemes. On 1 June, Government launched its Economic Recovery Plan 2021 with the goal of achieving rapid job creation and economic growth after the pandemic. This plan sets out new measures for businesses and affected sectors as the economy reopens, and details for continuing existing emergency pandemic financial supports including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), giving certainty to employers and employees.</p>  <p>  As the travel trade is part of the wider aviation and travel ecosystem, the needs of this particular sector will continue to be considered and I and my Department will maintain contact with the industry in the weeks ahead, and Government colleagues as required, as we get more clarity on the trajectory of the recovery of the economy generally and of international travel that is due to recommence from 19 July.</p></reply>

The theory test service provider has sourced approx. 30 additional employees to manage the online testing facility. The tests are conducted under strict requirements in order to adequately verify the identity of candidates, and to ensure exams are completed in a secure manner, maintaining the integrity of the exam content and to prevent cheating or fraud. To replicate the highly secure nature of in-person testing, the on-line testing service requires live proctors to perform the required security and ID checks and monitor the theory tests in a live online environment. </p></reply>

It is expected that this piece of work will take approximately six months, following which a period of consultation will take place, most likely in Q4 2021.

As the Deputy may be aware, this recent rise of shipping costs is a global issue. In the first half of 2021, the volume of goods traded globally has increased significantly. Surging demand coupled with moderate supply growth is the cause of the current upward pressure on shipping charter rates. The surging demand is evident on all major containership routes, particularly on transpacific (North America &ndash; Asia) routes. Disruption to supply lines during initial waves of the pandemic has meant that capacity in the containership industry has not kept pace with demand, driving shipping charter rates upward. </p>  <p>  Operators in Ireland are likely to have experienced these trends, as they have fed down to smaller vessels in the containership market. Many load-on/load-off (LoLo) twenty foot containers (TEUs) to/from Ireland are fed to/from very large port &ldquo;hubs&rdquo; such as Rotterdam, Antwerp and Liverpool. From here, many goods continue to North America and Asia among other destinations. </p>  <p>  The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) publishes the Irish Maritime Transport Economist (IMTE) each year. This publication is a statistical bulletin and a comprehensive source of national maritime traffic, trade and global shipping market data. The 2021 edition noted a sizeable fluctuation in shipping charter rates for containership vessels throughout 2020 &ndash; the suppressive impact of COVID-19 in the first half of that year, followed by a resurgence in demand for goods in the second half of that year. This highlights the impact that demand for containership vessels has on shipping charter rates. </p>  <p>  The IMTE refers to Clarkson's Containership Time Charter Index, which measures the price of moving freight in the containership market, and how this index was at a record high by the end of 2020 and that gains were maintained in early 2021.The IMTE notes that the early resurgence in rates was driven by larger vessels, which was fed down to all vessel classes. I am informed by the IMDO that as of May 2021, the surge in global goods trade has continued, which has led to continued upward pressure on freight rates. The IMTE notes that the market is expected to return to more 'normal' levels as demand for services increases as more economies fully reopen. </p>  <p>  Overall, the resurgence in demand has not been met by supply and prices have increased as a result. As economies open up again, and this demand is alleviated, it is anticipated that the market will return to more normal levels but any associated timeline for this remains uncertain.</p></reply>

This commitment is evident in my Department's recently published Statement of Strategy 2021-2023, which can be accessed on my Department's website at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/70e6d-statement-of-strategy-2021-2023/</i>.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Public Sector Duty, as provided for in Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, places a legal obligation on all public bodies, including all central government departments, to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees and everyone affected by their functions and services. My Department has worked closely with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) in the development of our Public Sector Duty Assessment and Action Plan, which was published in October 2020. A copy of the Assessment and Action Plan is available on my Department's website at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/59bac-public-sector-equality-and-human-rights-duty/</i>.</p><p>I am mindful of the fact that this is an ongoing duty that must be continuously monitored, reviewed, and developed and my Department will continue to work with IHREC in this regard, and progress on its implementation will be reported in my Department's Annual Reports</p><p>With regard to disability impact assessments, the Government's focus is on the development of an integrated equality proofing process that covers all nine equality grounds plus poverty rather than on separate impact assessments.</p><p>In this regard, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is co-lead, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group (EBEAG). In March 2021, the Government agreed to establish an inter-departmental group for Equality Budgeting, of which my Department is a member, to facilitate the embedding of the initiative across all Government departments.</p><p>Equality Budgeting aims to provide greater information on how proposed or ongoing budgetary decisions impact on particular groups in society, thereby integrating equality concerns into the budgetary process. Providing greater information on the likely impacts of budgetary measures facilitates the integration of equality concerns into the budgetary process, helping to avoid unintended adverse outcomes and enhancing the Government's decision-making framework.  Disability is a specific strand in this process.</p><p>In addition, as required under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), my Department has in place a disability consultative committee, known as the Accessibility Consultative Committee (ACC). The ACC's role is to monitor and review progress in relation to the implementation of actions under the NDIS where my Department and/or its agencies have the lead role. Membership of the ACC is drawn from: </p><p>- organisations representing people with disabilities; </p><p>- members of the Disability Stakeholders Group;</p><p>- key agencies under the aegis of my Department; and</p><p>- other relevant State Agencies.</p><p>Further information on public transport accessibility, including Work Programme Progress Reports, the minutes of ACC meetings, and presentations to the ACC by key State Agencies can be accessed on my Department's website at the following link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/705a02-accessibility-in-transport/</i>.</p></reply>

While the specific report referred to by the Deputy has not been shared with my Department, I would like to assure the Deputy that the CTTC has kept my Department fully appraised of the issues facing the sector throughout the crisis. I am aware of the very difficult business environment that the commercial operators have been facing. Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors.</p>  <p>  Public transport is a key facilitator of interaction in the economy and society. It is an efficient and sustainable way of getting people to work, education, shopping and other social engagements. The essential nature of these services has been acknowledged a number of times by the Government in recent months, most notably in the decision to provide additional funding for public service obligation (PSO) services and the introduction of temporary funding measures for the licensed bus sector.</p>  <p>  In June 2020 the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial support for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services. The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months. However, as it remains the case that commercial bus operators are still under severe financial distress due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19, on 26 January 2021, Government decided to extend the temporary funding supports for the licensed bus sector for a further period of 3 months, with an option to extend contracts on a monthly basis thereafter. </p>  <p>  In relation to coach tourism - a fund of &euro;10m was made available under the 2020 July Stimulus package to assist the Coach Tourism sector. The Coach Tourism Business Continuity Scheme is administered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and is under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Catherine Martin.</p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. </p>  <p>  Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. The scheme is designed to help traders meet their costs at a time when they cannot provide goods or services to their customers from their business premises, or can only do so to a limited extent, due to COVID-19 related restrictions.</p>  <p>  Revenue have advised me that an application to register for the CRSS has not been received to date from the business in question. Consequently, the business has not been in receipt of the CRSS.  If the business carries on a trading activity which might be eligible for the CRSS, they should submit a registration application to Revenue. Information on how to apply is given in the guidelines available on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  However, businesses operating coaches do not generally qualify for CRSS because they do not provide their services from premises that their customers must access but, instead, provide their services on their coaches.  If the business is operating coaches for tourism purposes, they may be eligible for support under schemes such as the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Business Continuity Scheme designed to assist  tourism businesses.</p>  <p>  On 1 June, I announced that an additional business support scheme, the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), would be available for businesses whose turnover in the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 is reduced by 75% compared with their 2019 turnover.  To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D.  The BRSS will come into operation from early September.  Under the scheme, a qualifying business will be able to claim a cash payment calculated as three times the sum of 10% of their average weekly turnover up to &euro;20,000 and 5% on any excess of average weekly turnover above &euro;20,000, subject to a maximum payment under the scheme of &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed individuals may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme. </p><p>In summary, the process to claim HTB involves two stages, application stage and claim stage. At the application stage, the claimant notifies Revenue of his/her intention to make a HTB claim and checks are carried out to ensure the applicant satisfies certain conditions of the scheme. Once confirmed, Revenue notifies the applicant about the potential HTB refund available. </p><p>Section 477C (8) provides: </p> <blockquote> 	&quot;An application made in any tax year shall cease to be valid on the earlier of the following events:<br /><br />(a) (i) failure by the applicant to satisfy the conditions specified in subsection (6)(b);  	(ii) on the rescission of the applicant's tax clearance certificate in accordance with subsection (3A) of section 1095<i>;</i>or<br /><br />(iii) on the falling of 31 December in the tax year in which the application is made. (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) and subsection (25), where an application is made under this section in the period commencing on 1 October and ending on 31 December in any of the tax years [2017 to 2021] (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the &ldquo;first-mentioned period&rdquo;), and the corresponding claim is made under subsection (3) in the period commencing on 1 January and ending on 31 March of the following year, the applicant shall be deemed to have made his or her claim in the first-mentioned period.<br /><br />(c) No claim may be made on foot of an application which ceases to be valid in accordance with paragraph (a).&quot; </blockquote>  <p>In respect to point (a)(iii) above, for example where an application is made during the period 1 October to 31 December 2021, and a claim is made on foot of such an application in the period 1 January to 31 March 2022, the claim will be deemed to have been made in 2021.  In such cases, where the corresponding claim is made between 1 January and 31 March of the following year, the claim will be deemed to be made in the prior year. However, the timeframe for entering into a contract to purchase or, in the case of a self-build, to have drawn down the first tranche of a qualifying loan does not change, the end date of 31 December 2021 for so doing still applies. </p><p>Revenue Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-46 outlines further guidance on the conditions and operation of the HTB scheme. </p></reply>

The EWSS replaced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme which ceased on 31 August 2020. To be eligible for EWSS, an employer must have tax clearance for the duration of the scheme and be able to demonstrate that turnover or customer orders have declined by at least 30% due to the disruption caused by COVID-19.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question registered for EWSS on 15/09/2020 and has been in receipt of EWSS from September 2020.</p>  <p>  A business must conduct ongoing reviews on a monthly basis to demonstrate their basis for an expected 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders between 1 July and 31 December 2020 for 2020 pay dates and between 1 January and 30 June 2021 for 2021 pay dates. Employers must undertake a review of the relevant six-month period on the last day of every month to be satisfied that they continue to meet the eligibility criteria and to take the necessary action of withdrawing from the scheme where they do not.</p>  <p>  If circumstances change the following month and the employer is again eligible, they can reregister and claim from the date of reregistration. Revenue expects there is a reasonable and durable basis to the review carried out as regards the potential drop in turnover or customer orders. </p>  <p>  As the business concerned commenced trading on 19 April 2019, it is required to compare its turnover or customer orders for the period 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2021 to its turnover or customer orders relative to the period 19 April 2019 to 30 June 2019.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue would not consider the sale of food and drinks in a restaurant or bar as being separate trades.  If a business changes its business model, such as to include the service of food as in this case, and the change results in increased turnover then the business must review if it continues to be eligible for EWSS. All turnover from the business must be included in the ongoing monthly reviews and it would not be permissible to treat the sale of food and drink separately.</p></reply>

Secondly, it is also important to highlight that reform of the international tax rules has been an ongoing process since 2013.</p>  <p>  In this respect, Ireland has very much played its part in reframing these rules for the benefit of business and citizens, and we have proactively and diligently reformed our tax code in line with the new international norms. A lot has been achieved through the OECD&rsquo;s BEPS process and we now have far more robust international tax rules and safeguards to prevent abuse, arbitrage, base erosion and profit shifting than existed a decade ago.</p>  <p>  Since 2018, Ireland has constructively engaged in the more recent discussions to find a solution at the OECD to address the broader tax challenges of digitalisation and globalisation.  This is the subject of the current negotiations which are expected to conclude this year. </p>  <p>  The OECD is proposing a two pillar solution. Pillar 1 concerns the allocation of a proportion of taxing rights to the market jurisdiction, while Pillar 2 concerns a series of rules, the Income Inclusion Rule, the Under-Taxed Payment Rule and the Subject to Tax Rule which are designed to ensure a minimum effective tax rate for large multi-national enterprises.  It is important to note that the Pillar 2 proposals are broadly based on an existing US regime, GILTI, which applies to US multinationals in Ireland and may already subject these multi-national enterprises to a top up tax in the US.   </p>  <p>  The US is proposing a minimum effective tax rate of 'at least 15%' which is supported by the G7. This minimum rate creates challenges for Ireland and other small countries for good reasons.  I believe that any agreement must be able to accommodate healthy and fair tax competition. Small countries, and Ireland is one of them, need to be able to use tax policy as a legitimate lever to compensate for advantages of scale, location, resources, industrial heritage and the real, material and persistent advantage enjoyed by larger countries.  At the same time, I fully accept that there needs to be clear boundaries to ensure any competition is fair and sustainable.</p>  <p>  It is my intention to continue to make a case for the agreement to accommodate Ireland&rsquo;s low but substantial 12.5% rate.</p>  <p>  There will be a meeting of 139 members of the Inclusive framework on 1 July in order to try reaching a consensus agreement on key principles. Further technical work will continue over the summer and in the autumn with a view to achieving a comprehensive agreement in October in lines with the principles agreed.</p>  <p>  The Government has said for some time that change is coming and we will adapt to this change as we have done before. </p></reply>

Both the State Contributory Pension and the State Non-Contributory Pension are chargeable to income tax, but not to Universal Social Charge (USC) or Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI).</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides for the payment of an increase in the amount of weekly State pensions where the beneficiary of the pension has a qualified adult dependant.  Although the qualifying adult portion of the pension is paid directly to the qualified adult, this payment is premised on there being an entitlement by the beneficiary to the pension in the first instance.  As stated in section 112 of the Social Welfare Consolidation 2005 Act, the qualified adult portion is an &ldquo;increase&rdquo; in the pension and is payable in respect of a spouse/civil partner/cohabitant who is being financially maintained and whose income is not greater than a specified amount.</p>  <p>  The tax treatment of the qualified adult increase is provided for in section 126(2B) Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, as inserted by Section 12 of the Finance (No. 2) Act of 2013.  That section provides that, for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts, any increase in the State pension in respect of a qualified adult dependant is treated as if it arises to, and is payable to, the beneficiary of the pension.  Since the increase is treated as income of the beneficiary for tax purposes, only one employee (PAYE) tax credit &ndash; valued at &euro;1,650 - is available in respect of the State Pension, including the qualified adult dependent increase. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question as to the estimated annual cost to the Exchequer in each of the years 2022 to 2026 of providing for a PAYE tax credit for the qualified adult dependent, I am further advised by Revenue that there are significant variables to consider in order to determine an individual&rsquo;s final tax liability position and as such it is not possible to provide an estimated cost.  This will be dependent on his or her civil status, his or her available tax credits or the amount of income received from other sources or perhaps an individual may not have sufficient sources of income to partially or fully avail of the PAYE credit in his or her own right. Furthermore, by virtue of section 188 TCA 1997, a person aged 65 and over is exempt from income tax where his or her total income is less than the relevant exemption limit.  For 2021, the exemption limits are &euro;36,000 for a married couple or civil partners and &euro;18,000 for a single individual.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to make the Deputy aware that the Minister for Social Protection recently provided details of the number of recipients of State pension (contributory) and State pension (non-contributory) respectively, who were also claiming an increase for a qualified adult and these statistics are set out in Parliamentary Question 13850/21, which can be located at the following link - www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/question/2021-03-11/140/?highlight%5B0%5D=13850.</p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. </p>  <p>  Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.</p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises.  This means that in the case of a travel agent that operates from a business premises, they may qualify for support under the scheme provided they meet all the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises under the public health regulations.</p>  <p>  As non-essential retail, including travel agent businesses, were permitted to open from 17 May 2021, they are no longer subject to Covid restrictions which would require them to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Therefore, from that date, they ceased to qualify for support under the CRSS. However, subject to meeting the relevant criteria, a business such as a travel agent business, reopening after a period of restrictions, may claim a &ldquo;restart week payment&rdquo; under the CRSS scheme to assist it with the costs of reopening. </p>  <p>  For businesses reopening between 29 April 2021 and 1 June 2021, an &ldquo;enhanced restart week payment&rdquo; may be claimed, which is computed at double the normal weekly CRSS rate, for two weeks, subject to a maximum weekly amount payable of &euro;5,000.</p>  <p>  On 1 June, I announced that an additional business support scheme, the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), would be available for businesses whose turnover in the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 is reduced by 75% compared with their 2019 turnover.  To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D.  The BRSS will come into operation from early September.  Under the scheme, a qualifying business will be able to claim a cash payment calculated as three times the sum of 10% of their average weekly turnover up to &euro;20,000 and 5% on any excess of average weekly turnover above &euro;20,000, subject to a maximum payment under the scheme of &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed individuals may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with my Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four.</p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles.  The 0% BIK rate forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of electric vehicles, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging. The BIK exemption was intended as a temporary measure and is set to end at year end 2022, coinciding with the onset of the new BIK regime on 1/1/2023. Electric vehicles will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage. ICE vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars.</p></reply>

This new measure is &lsquo;triggered&rsquo; when a residential unit is acquired on or after 20 May 2021, with the &lsquo;look-back&rsquo; 12-month period commencing at this time on a rolling basis. The units acquired during that period are aggregated. When the 10th unit is acquired, it is chargeable at the 10% rate and this rate also then applies to the other 9 units and to any other units acquired at the same time as the 10th unit. However, while any units acquired before 20 May 2021 are taken into account in establishing whether the threshold of 10 units has been reached, the 10% rate of stamp duty is not applied to these units but only to those units acquired on or after this date. </p>  <p>  Multiple purchases by Local Authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, and the Housing Agency are outside the scope of this new higher stamp duty rate. </p>  <p>  In this regard, you should also note that the legislation to  put the measure set out in the May 19th Financial Resolution on a permanent statutory footing is included in the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021,which was published last week and is due to have its second stage in the D&aacute;il later this week. In that Bill I have included an additional exemption from the 10% rate where a lease is immediately entered into with a housing authority for the purpose of the provision of social housing support to a qualified household. In other words, it facilitates the provision of the mortgage to rent scheme by private sector participants.</p>  <p>  Additional possible exemptions are currently being examined, and if any are identified as warranting inclusion in the legislation, they will be provided for as soon as it is practical to do so. These however will only be provided for following consultation with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  and the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

The cumulative impact of the implementation of these is intended to improve both the cost and availability of insurance for all groups, particularly businesses. </p><p>In this regard, one of the key responsibilities of my Department has been to work with the Central Bank to expand the scope of the National Claims Information Database (NCID) to facilitate the collection of data on employer and public liability insurance claims. The technical work has been completed, and the Central Bank expects to publish the first NCID Report on these claims by the middle of July. I anticipate  that this new report will provide a wealth of data in relation to this insurance market, which is significant for many businesses and community groups throughout the country. </p><p>The report will be the first of its kind, and is expected to offer a valuable insight into several important features of the employers&rsquo; and public liability market, including an analysis of premiums, claims, settlements channels and income and expenditure. This enhanced transparency will be key to further developing our understanding of how claims costs are impacting premiums, and in particular, the relationship between the price paid by a customer for a policy and the cost to insurance undertakings.</p><p>Over time, further iterations of the report should enable us to assess the impact of other key reforms being undertaken as part of the Action Plan.  In particular, future NCID reports on employer and public liability insurance, as well as motor insurance, should reveal whether the savings afforded by the Personal Injuries Guidelines are being reflected in the form of lower premiums.  As such, these reports will be a crucial tool to enable Government hold insurers to account on their commitments to pass on savings from lower award levels to consumers. </p><p>It may interest the Deputy to know that officials in the Department are already engaging with the Central Bank to consider whether additional enhancements could be made to the NCID to further enhance transparency around the impact of the Guidelines.  As such, technical work is required to review the current data specification and how it might incorporate these developments, including potentially though legislation.  </p><p>In conclusion, I look forward to the publication of the first NCID Report on employers&rsquo; and public liability claims shortly, and believe this marks a significant milestone in the insurance reform agenda. </p></reply>

The whole-of-Government approach being taken through the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>therefore sets out 66 actions which aim to improve both the cost and availability of this key financial services, particularly for businesses. In this regard, I welcome the implementation of the <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines</i>, which represents a key achievement of this insurance reform agenda, and was realised several months ahead of schedule.</p><p>The Guidelines significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue.  Of note is that a number of common injuries will now move to the jurisdiction of the District rather than the Circuit Court, thus reducing associated legal fees. The Guidelines also provide guidance in relation to injuries previously not included in the Book of Quantum and will be used by both the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) and the judiciary. Therefore, they should help to bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such reinforce the benefits of using the PIAB to settle claims. This in turn should further reduce the costs of claims, particularly legal fees. I have previously set out my view that these costs, rather than the profit component, tend to represent a bigger factor in the cost of insurance premiums. As such, it is important that they are lowered.  </p><p>As Minister for Finance, my expectation is that insurers will now commence reflecting savings from reduced award levels to customers, in line with past commitments, and I intend to hold them to account on this. Minister of State Fleming met with the CEOs of the main insurers operating in Ireland to set out the Government&rsquo;s expectation in this regard. These engagements were positive, with insurers indicating that they will begin lowering premiums in response to the Guidelines. The Minister of State will meet with CEOs again later this year to review their ongoing response to this and other key reforms. My officials are also engaging with the Central Bank to consider what enhancements could be made to further improve transparency through the National Claims Information Database, so that the impact of the Guidelines can be seen in future motor, employer and public liability reports.  </p><p>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that work remains ongoing across Government to deliver further elements of the Action Plan, including measures to reform the PIAB, reduce fraud, and make changes to the duty of care in order to strengthen waivers and notices. It is my hope that the implementation of these key actions in particular should further help to lower insurance costs for businesses. </p></reply>

RIAs consider a broad range of impacts and would indicate any identified impact on people with disabilities. Should the requirement arise, my Department would carry out a DIA in accordance with the Cabinet Handbook and the DIA Guidelines set out by the Department of Justice. </p>  <p>  My Department participates in the Equality Budgeting Advisory Group, led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts including representatives from the National Disability Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. Stakeholders provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy, progress the initiative and further guide the rollout of equality budgeting. The scope of Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to include other dimensions of equality such as poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. My Department is also a joint sponsor of the ongoing work on well-being measurement, with the goal of creating a broader context for policy-making, inclusive of aspects such as equality and human rights. </p>  <p>  While the bodies under the aegis of my Department may be asked to provide observations on Memoranda, they are not responsible for bringing Memoranda to Cabinet and therefore do not carry out DIAs.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-29a.404.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062900065#WRH04300"><p>At the outset, I wish to acknowledge that the issue of the payment of Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) by unmarried cohabitants  both in relation to a shared primary residence home and other assets is a complex issue.</p>  <p>  The  starting point for considering this matter is that cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership. Under the law, couples who have obtained legal recognition of their relationship status through marriage or civil partnership are not in an analogous situation to other cohabiting couples, which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples cannot be considered in isolation, solely in respect of Capital Acquisitions Tax. There are implications, for example, for income tax and social welfare treatment also. For this reason, this can be considered only in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.  </p>  <p>  However, the above said  there are a number of reliefs for cohabitants under CAT. For instance, cohabiting individuals can avail of the &lsquo;dwelling house exemption&rsquo; to bequeath their principal private residence, generally the most substantial asset owned by an individual, free from inheritance tax. To qualify for the exemption, the inherited house must have been the deceased cohabitant&rsquo;s principal private residence at the date of his or her death. This requirement is relaxed in situations where the deceased person had to leave the house before the date of death because of ill health; for example, to live in in a nursing home. In addition, the inheriting cohabitant must not have a beneficial interest in another residential property. Finally, the inheriting cohabitant must have lived in the house for 3 years prior to the date of the inheritance and must continue to live in the house for 6 years after the date of the inheritance.</p>  <p>  Agricultural property and relevant business property can also be gifted or bequeathed between cohabitants with a significant 90% reduction in their taxable values under the agricultural relief and business relief schemes where the relevant conditions are met. The dwelling house exemption, agricultural relief and business relief are available irrespective of the relationship between the individuals concerned and apply equally to married couples, civil partners, cohabitants, siblings or any other form of relationship.</p>  <p>  Section 88A of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 exempts transfers of property, made under a court order, between qualified cohabitants within the meaning of Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants (CPCROC) Act 2010. The CPROC  Act defines &ldquo;qualified cohabitants&rdquo; as persons who have been in a committed and loving relationship with another person for a minimum period of 5 years (2 years where they are parents of one or more dependent children), whose relationship has ended due to death or separation and neither of whom was married to and living with another person in 4 of the 5 years immediately before the end of the relationship. </p></reply>

It oversaw the introduction of an e-learning module on human rights and equality for new staff members, carried out a review of all communications in the Office, introduced a revised internal communications strategy focusing on the availability of needs assessments and assistive technologies and enhanced the accessibility of the Office for staff and visitors </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>State Laboratory </td>       <td>The State Laboratory does not deal with the public.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-29a.434.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062900066#WRJ01300"><p>Built on the performance budgeting framework that has been progressively embedded into the budget cycle since its introduction in 2011, Equality Budgeting has been developed over recent years with a view to enhancing the role of resource allocation policies in advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.  Equality budgeting should not be regarded as something separate from the budget process; the intention is to embed equality perspectives across the whole-of-year budgetary process.  The pilot programme of equality budgeting was introduced for the 2018 budgetary cycle, anchored in the existing performance budgeting framework. Following the achievements of the pilot programme, Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to further develop the gender budgeting elements and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability.  </p><p>Responsibility for proofing expenditure programmes, the selection of indicators, and making progress towards achieving the high-level goals articulated remains a matter for the individual Departments in the first instance. The role of my Department is to facilitate and advance this initiative and provide support for Departments to clarify and to fulfil their equality-related objectives.  </p><p>To further guide the rollout of equality budgeting, an Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group was established, holding its first meeting in September 2018. This group, including the National Disability Authority, is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance equality budgeting policy. Earlier this year, Government agreed to the establishment of an inter-departmental group for Equality Budgeting to facilitate the embedding of the initiative across all Government Departments. This group will play a key role in guiding the continued progress of Equality Budgeting and as a result of this group's efforts, it is expected that all Departments will be participating in Equality Budgeting within the next 12 months.</p><p>All public bodies in Ireland have responsibility to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and plans. This is a legal obligation, referred to as the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty, and it originates in Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) are also members of the Expert Advisory Group and the Public Sector Duty is reflected in all Equality Budgeting policies as appropriate.  Details of the implementation of the Public Sector Equality and Human Rights Duty by the Department are set out on the gov.ie website at thislink: <i>www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/5df24-public-sector-equality-and-human-rights-duty/</i>.</p><p>In terms of employment, I am committed to ensuring that we continue to build a diverse Civil Service that is reflective of the modern Ireland that we serve.  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have policy responsibility for recruitment to the Civil Service. The Civil Service is strongly committed to equality of opportunity for all in terms of its recruitment and employment practices. Within my own Department, the HR Unit developed a HR Strategy that has a focus on embracing and embedding a culture of diversity and inclusion across the Department through diversity initiatives and training. This has included the establishment of a vibrant cross-Divisional and cross-grade Diversity and Inclusion staff forum, the PERspectives Group. My Department has a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) who supports new members of staff with a disability or existing staff who acquire a disability and raise awareness about disability. New hires receive the <i>Code of Practice for the Employment of People with a Disability in the Irish Civil Service</i>, a welcome letter from the Department&rsquo;s DLO and FAQs on Disability prepared by the National Disability Authority. The induction of new hires includes a presentation and Q&amp;amp;A session with the DLO. </p><p>The position in relation to the bodies under the aegis of my Department is set out below. All bodies under my aegis have appointed Disability Liaison Officers (DLOs) and have proactively made available work placement opportunities for participants on the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) Programme and the Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) Programme, with a number of these being converted to permanent positions. Embedding diversity and inclusion within each body is a core focus of the respective Management Boards with key ED&amp;amp;I initiatives reflected in existing local HR strategies or those being developed by bodies, such as the EMPOWER People Strategy in the case of the Office of Government Procurement.</p><p>Office of Public Works (OPW)</p><p>The Office of Public Works is subject to compliance with Guidelines set out in the Cabinet Handbook in respect of Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) of policy and legislative proposals submitted to Cabinet via Memoranda to Government.  The Cabinet Handbook requires that such Memoranda include an indication of the impacts on people with disabilities arising from proposed changes to the regulatory framework.  Appendix III of the Handbook sets out step-by-step processes for conducting regulatory impact screening and impact assessment. </p><p>While the functions and purpose of the Office of Public Works are such that the Office is not primarily involved in developing national policy or legislation, the process steps set out in the Cabinet Handbook guide the Office&rsquo;s approach to undertaking any necessary disability impact assessments.  </p><p>Public Appointments Service (PAS)</p><p>PAS protect and respect equality, diversity &amp;amp; human rights in all dealings with customers, and within services provided, procedures and processes, in accordance with Public Sector Duty principles.  PAS are an Equal Opportunities Employer and this is highlighted in advertising and communication with PAS candidates. It is essential for PAS that processes do not have an adverse impact on candidates within any of the protected grounds. PAS have an Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (ED&amp;amp;I) unit to develop strategies and policies related to ED&amp;amp;I, and a Disability Champion to act as a point of contact for candidates with a disability.</p><p>The tests and assessments used as part of recruitment processes are trialled to ensure they are free from bias. A range of reasonable accommodations or adjustments are provided to candidates on a case by case basis to ensure they have an equal opportunity to perform within the assessment processes, which includes extra time, scribes, format changes and screen reader technology. Candidate performance on assessments is monitored against a range of areas including gender, age and disability to ensure that there is no adverse impact.</p><p>PAS undertook a web accessibility audit in August 2020 working with an expert in this field to identify areas for potential improvement in accessibility across all website platforms. The improvements have already been implemented or scheduled for implementation throughout 2021 through the wider organisational digital transformation goals.</p><p>National Shared Services Office (NSSO)</p><p>Whilst the National Shared Services Office (NSSO) does not carry out disability impact assessments, due consideration is given to understanding the impact of existing or proposed services, policies and practices in relation to their consequences for equality for persons with a disability. The NSSO is an equally opportunity employer. </p><p>Office of the Ombudsman</p><p>The Ombudsman examines complaints about failures by public service providers to provide accessible buildings, services and information, as required under Part 3 of the Disability Act 2005.  </p><p>As an oversight body, the Office of the Ombudsman is less involved with developing public policy, rather ensuring high standards of fairness in policy developed by other public bodies.  Because of this, where the issue of disability impact assessment mainly arises is (i) in relation to the complaint mechanisms the Office provides to the public and (ii) in relation to how the office promote and have oversight of equality of access in other organisations.</p><p>The Office has an appointed Access Officer in line with Section 26(2) of the Disability Act 2005.  The Access Officer is responsible for providing, arranging or co-ordinating assistance to persons with disabilities who wish to access the services provided by the Office. They also act as a point of contact for persons with disabilities who wish to access such services. In carrying out their duties, the Access Officer reports to the Equality and Diversity Officer, the Public Sector Duty Committee and the Head of Corporate Services. The Access Officer is responsible for ensuring access to services at all time that are in line with the provisions of the Disability Act.</p><p>State Laboratory</p><p>The State Laboratory has not been required to carry out a disability impact assessment as it does not submit substantive policy proposals requiring Government approval and which can have an impact on the wider/ public community. </p><p>Office of the National Lottery Regulator (ORNL)</p><p>The role of the Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery (ORNL) is to procure and regulate the holding of the Irish National Lottery.  As such, it does not provide any services directly to the public, or prepare any policies or practices that impact directly on the public in general or on people with disabilities.  </p></reply>

In particular, it addressed paragraph 2.8.3 which provided that &ldquo;building on earlier work on the standardisation of terms and conditions of employment across the public service, the Parties agree to review current arrangements for starting pay on transfer and promotion in the public service with a view to simplifying and modernising the current arrangements and removing impediments to cross-sectoral mobility&rdquo;. </p></reply>

LPSS 2021 builds on the successful pilot Live Performance Support Scheme in 2020, which provided thousands of days of employment to hundreds of musicians, actors, crew and technicians in tandem with a pipeline of high quality on-line much needed entertainment for Irish audiences. The 237 grants awarded will help to support employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.</p><p>While there are no plans at present for a further round of the scheme, the <i>Economic Recovery Plan </i>published on 1 June stated that Government also recognises that as long as physical distancing remains a public health requirement, further supports may be needed for these sectors.In that context, supports are kept under review in light of developments in public health guidance.</p><p>I have also made an allocation of &euro;14m available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.  The main features of this new scheme will see support offered by way of three levels of flat payments:</p><p>- &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;50,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;3,000 incurred from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.</p><p>- &euro;4,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;50,001- &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;6,000 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.</p><p>- &euro;5,000 for businesses with VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;7,500 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.</p><p>Under the scheme, self employed businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio  equipment suppliers operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector are eligible to apply. Applications may be made via the MEBAS application portal on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>I have also made an allocation of &euro;5 million available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.  This will allow for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers.  This funding will be allocated shortly.</p><p>In addition, I have announced an additional &euro;11.5m for a new Events Sector Covid Support Scheme which I hope to launch soon.  This scheme will target SMEs in the events sector which aren&rsquo;t eligible for the CRSS and for whom MEBAS and the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19 will not make a significant contribution to fixed costs relative to the level of support that that would be available under CRSS, had such SMEs been eligible for that support. </p></reply>

Such conditions may relate to the implementation of environmental mitigation measures; times of operation; control of noise, blasting, dust, water pollution and waste; environmental monitoring; special contributions; extraction limits and site restoration etc.</p>  <p>  Under planning legislation, enforcement of unauthorised development is a matter for the relevant planning authority, which can take action if a development does not have the required permission, or where the terms of a permission have not been met. </p>  <p>  There are extensive enforcement provisions provided for in Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the Act), with a view to ensuring that works pertaining to permitted developments are carried out in accordance with the planning permission granted and any associated conditions and that no unauthorised development takes place, including in relation to quarries.  In addition, any person or a planning authority may seek a court order under section 160 of the Act in relation to unauthorised development with a view to ensuring that the development works in question are not carried out or continued.   </p>  <p>  Provision for the recoupment of costs arising from enforcement action taken by planning authorities is provided for under section 154 of the Act.  Section 154(5)(b) provides that an enforcement notice shall require that such steps as may be specified in the notice be taken within a specified period, including, where appropriate, the removal, demolition or alteration of any structure and the discontinuance of any use and, in so far as is practicable, the restoration of the land to its condition prior to the commencement of the development.</p>  <p>  Section 154(5)(c) further provides that if the steps specified in the enforcement notice are not taken within a specified period (not being more than 6 months), the planning authority may enter on the land and take such steps and may recover any expenses reasonably incurred by them in that behalf.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, section 154(5)(d) provides that an enforcement notice shall require the person or persons served with the notice to refund to the planning authority the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the authority, including costs incurred in respect of the remuneration and other expenses of employees, consultants and advisers. </p>  <p>  Section 154(7) further provides that if required, any expenses reasonably incurred by a planning authority may be recovered as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction from the person or persons on whom the notice was served.  Alternatively, the costs incurred by a planning authority may be secured by charging the land under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, or where the person on whom the enforcement notice was served is the owner of the land, an instrument vesting the ownership of the land in the authority subject to a right of redemption by the owner within five years. </p>  <p>  Section 156 sets out the penalties that may be applied in relation to non-compliance with specific sections of the Act.  In this connection, 156(1) provides that a person who is guilty of an offence shall be liable, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &pound;10,000,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years, or to both.  It further provides that a person who is guilty of an offence shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or to both.

In the 10-month period between August 2020 and the end of May 2021 ,  475 tenants sent a self-declaration to the RTB indicating that they were unable to pay their rent as a result of the impact of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  With regard to the number of eviction notices issued in Cork City in 2021, my Department does not collect the data sought, however the Clerk of the D&aacute;il requested that arrangements be put in place to facilitate the provision of information by State Bodies to members of the Oireachtas.  Following the issue of Circular LG (P)05/16 on 20 September 2016 from my Department, the RTB set up a dedicated email address for this purpose.

The main aim of the boundary extension was to allow the potential for further development within a new City Council area, while also incentivising higher density development and reducing the risk of sprawl.  The extended City area now includes Ballincollig, Carrigrohane, Blarney, Glanmire and Cork airport and the population of the city increased by over 85,000 people.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Act 2019 was enacted on 31 January 2019  to provide for the transfer of part of the administrative area of Cork County Council to the administrative area of Cork City and this took place when the new Councils took office after the local elections in late May 2019. </p>  <p>  The Act also provided for  the establishment of the statutory Cork Boundary Alteration Implementation Oversight Committee to oversee arrangements for the alteration of the boundary in accordance with the statutory implementation plan. </p>  <p>  Work on finalising the transfer of functions was completed in late 2020 and both authorities have confirmed that all the actions contained in the Statutory Implementation Plan have been discharged with new service delivery models now in place in both authorities. A small number of outstanding practical issues are still being worked through by both authorities with my Department's support. The Local Government Act 2019 provides a mechanism for resolving outstanding issues up to and including a Ministerial decision.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the outstanding matters can be resolved in the coming weeks and therefore, while a review to determine the overall success of the boundary extension may be considered in the future, at this stage of implementation it would be extremely premature as both councils have yet to complete a full annual cycle within their new working arrangements. It is considered beneficial, instead, to wait until both authorities have had time to settle in and until there is sufficient data for a review. </p></reply>

It is also recommended that local authorities should review their schedule of standardised cost on a twice yearly basis using the services of a Quantity Surveyor. The standardisation of costs is intended to improve consistency and have a cost stabilisation effect on grant levels in each local authority area. Recognising however that individual homes may differ local authorities can, up to the maximum grant caps, approve a grant in excess of their own standard costings if the local authority feels a higher cost is justified. </p></reply>

Historic country houses are unique and irreplaceable repositories of architecture, art, history and culture. I appreciate the intrinsic, artistic, ecological, social and economic value of our historic houses and their associated landscapes. They are also an essential component of our tourist industry and can provide attractive and exciting venues for a wide range of events and activities such as musical concerts, historical re-enactment and festivals making them an essential feature of Ireland&rsquo;s annual events calendar. </p><p>I understand that there are ongoing challenges regarding the sustainable future of the remaining stock of Irish Historic Houses in private ownership. For owners, maintaining an historic house can present enormous technical, organisational and financial hurdles and therefore the identification of a viable use or uses with sufficient income to ensure their survival is essential. The future of our historic houses requires ongoing strategic planning, and the buildings require ongoing maintenance. </p><p>While my Department can help by providing grant aid for conservation works &ndash; for example through the Historic Structures Fund or Built Heritage Investment Scheme and, where properties have received a Section 482 determination from both my Department and Revenue, tax relief on such works &ndash; it is not realistic or prudent for the State to fully fund private houses. However, if we want to support owners in securing a viable future for their houses, and if we want to ensure the survival of these properties for future generations, we need to work together. </p><p>I understand that Historic Houses of Ireland has recently been offered a grant by the Heritage Council, which is funded by my Department, under its Heritage Sector Fund 2021 to commission a five-year strategic plan. Such a plan aligns with the objectives of the <i>Action Plan for the Sustainable Future of the Irish Historic House in Private Ownership</i>, and if delivered will allow Historic Houses of Ireland to develop a clear strategic plan for its future.

Securing value for money (VfM) is an overarching consideration throughout the PPP procurement process and the Central PPP Unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) provides guidance in relation to PPP projects to achieve this objective. </p><p>The estimated full value of Bundle 1 and Bundle 2 of the Social Housing PPP contracts in nominal terms is &euro;301 million and &euro;253 million respectively (both figures are exclusive of VAT and include a forecast of inflation). The duration of both contracts is the construction period plus a 25-year operating period. This PPP Programme is being delivered through the &lsquo;availability&rsquo;-based PPP model. Under this type of contract, the PPP project company, as the private partner, designs, builds, finances and maintains public buildings on sites provided by the State, in this case through the local authority. Payment is made by the State only once construction of the buildings is complete and the units are ready to house tenants. The payment comprises a monthly &lsquo;availability&rsquo; and performance-based payment (or unitary charge) made over the term of the 25-year contract, which incorporates all costs under the contract, including construction, the upkeep and maintenance of the developments, tenancy management services, financing costs and inflation.</p><p>The upkeep and maintenance applies to the whole development and not just the individual houses, including external roadways, drainage systems, green areas and landscaping, playgrounds, and community facilities (where provided). The planned preventative maintenance regime includes life-cycling of key building components (e.g. heating systems) over the 25 years, including that necessary to meet the residual life handback requirements at the end of the 25 year period. The tenancy management service includes the administration of the tenancy agreement and collection of rent on behalf of the Local Authorities as landlord, void management and tenant allocations, operation of a helpdesk for tenants and support of community development.</p><p>To date, &euro;4.535 million has been paid by my Department in respect of the unitary charges for Bundle 1; there have been no unitary charge payments to date by my Department in respect of Bundle 2.  In accordance with the relevant project agreement, Dublin City Council as the Lead Authority for Bundle 1 pays these costs directly to the Bundle 1 consortium Comhar Housing. A breakdown of the Bundle 1 unitary charge payments to date are detailed in the table </p><p>below:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Item</b></th>       <th><b> Amount </b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Construction Costs</td>       <td>&euro;1,805,862</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Lifecycle Costs</td>       <td>&euro;442,424</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Operating &amp;amp; Maintenance Costs</td>       <td>&euro;2,041,504</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total Costs Invoiced (excl VAT)</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;4,289,790</b></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>VAT*</td>       <td>&euro;245,360</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total Unitary Charges Paid</b></td>       <td><b>&euro;4,535,150</b></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>*VAT rates applied at 0%, 13.5%, 21% and 23%, as appropriate, and where VAT was applied on a reverse charge basis, this was paid directly to the Revenue Commissionsers by Dublin City Council and recouped by my Department.</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department and the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) are currently working with the relevant Local Authorities including Dublin City Council as Lead Authority to progress the third bundle of sites in this PPP programme. Design development for the project is underway and the statutory consent process is expected to commence in Q3 2021. </p><p>The Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) is an essential part of any PPP project. It contains commercially sensitive information in relation to the methodology used for costing public sector projects and for the pricing of risks by public sector bodies. In accordance with DPER guidelines (Guidelines for the use of Public Private Partnerships), the final PSB, or any elements thereof, is not made public during the tendering process nor where it is intended to procure further similar projects in the near future (e.g. subsequent project bundles as part of an ongoing PPP programme). As Bundle 3 will follow the same structure as Bundles 1 and 2 and given the potential impact on value for money for the State, it is not appropriate to release the PSB for Bundles 1 and 2 at this time. </p><p>However, and in accordance with DPER guidelines, once an appropriate period of time has elapsed and the commercial sensitivity of the information on the project is no longer an issue (having regard also to any other similar PPP projects which may be in pre-procurement), the PSB should be made public. The Department will follow these guidelines in relation to the social housing PPP programme. </p></reply>

EN 771-3:2011+A1:2015&rsquo;</i>deals with aggregate concrete masonry units. In this regard, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), has published additional guidance in the form of &lsquo;<i>S.R. 325:2013+A2:2018/AC:2019 Recommendations for the design of masonry structures in Ireland to Eurocode 6&rsquo; which </i>sets out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of, <i>inter alia</i>, EN 771(series) in Ireland.</p><p>In respect of aggregates for concrete, NSAI has published <i>&lsquo;S.R. 16:2016 Guidance on the use of I.S. EN 12620:2002+A1:2008 - Aggregates for concrete&rsquo; </i>which<i></i>outlines the precautions to be taken in the quarry to reduce the risk of harmful impurities in aggregate production, including the requirement for independent third party oversight of factory production control by a Notified Body (a designated body that carries out third-party tasks). </p><p>Specifically relating to product legislation, since 2013, the Construction Products Directive (CPD)- 89/106/EEC has been replaced by the Construction Products Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 (CPR). It sets out rules for the marketing of construction products in the EU. Where a construction product covered by a harmonised standard is being placed on the EU market, the CPR requires the manufacturer to draw up a &lsquo;declaration of performance&rsquo; and affix a &lsquo;CE&rsquo; marking to the product. In order to do so, manufacturers must test and declare the performance of their construction products using a common technical language prescribed in the harmonised standard.</p><p>The manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) and in particular for the Declaration of Performance/CE marking of the construction product he/she is placing on the market, having full knowledge of the raw material (as is legally required by the CPR via the relevant harmonised European Standards) and having regard to the end product&rsquo;s suitability for use in construction works in accordance with the relevant Standard Recommendations published by the NSAI.</p><p>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 , each of the building control authorities have been designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the CPR, within their administrative areas. In addition, Dublin City Council has been appointed as a competent authority for the carrying out of market surveillance functions across the country and has created a Market Surveillance Unit called Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office, (DCC-NBCO).  Building control authorities will liaise with the DCC-NBCO national market surveillance unit to support compliance with the CPR and to determine appropriate action on enforcement matters, as they arise. </p><p>In regard to inspections, my Department is currently working with the DCC-NBCO and the City and County Management Association&rsquo;s (CCMA) on a revised inspection policy for building control. It is intended that the new policy will position building control authorities to carry out risk-based targeted inspections by making more efficient and effective use of the available resources. Much progress has been made in this area, an inspections protocol and methodology has been developed and a pilot IT system to support inspections has also been developed. The issue of targets and capacity will be considered further in this context.</p><p>Pursuant to Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) 765/2008, Ireland&rsquo;s National market surveillance programme 2021 is published on the website of the European Commission. Section 2.5 provides specific details with the market surveillance of construction products and outlines a market surveillance campaign led by the DCC-NBCO, which has recently commenced, to perform risk assessments of selected quarrying and pit operations, follow-up inspections, sampling and testing as appropriate to ensure compliance with the CPR.</p><p>Finally, the activity of quarrying falls under a number of legislative regimes. For example, quarries must have planning permission and from an operational perspective they must comply with health and safety regulations operated by Health and Safety Authority. In regard to the licensing of quarries, the Waste Management (Management of Waste from the Extractive Industries) Regulations 2009  came into operation on the 31 December 2009.  Under Regulation 19(1) each Local Authority shall:</p><p>Establish and maintain a register of all extractive industries within its functional area including the extraction, treatment and storage of mineral resources, the working of quarries, and the extraction, treatment and storage of peat. </p><p>The overall Register is maintained by the Environmental Protection Agency and is publicly available. The Environmental Protection Agency falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. </p><p>While the minimum performance requirements for buildings (including the materials used) are set in the Building Regulations, the procurement and purchasing of materials is a matter for the contracting authority. Responsibility for Public Procurement policy is a matter for the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), which operates as an office of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p></reply>

The SWELL project is funded under the European Regional Development Fund through the allocation of &euro;35m under INTERREG VA Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB). This figure includes a 15% match funding component provided by both the  Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage here and by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland. It is understood that the Withdrawal Agreement ratified between the EU and the UK in January 2020 provides for the full completion of pre-existing programmes thereby ensuring that projects such as SWELL can be fully completed post-Brexit. </p>  <p>  Operational matters relevant to the water services investment programme are a matter for Irish Water which has been given statutory responsibility for the planning, delivery and development of water services since 1 January 2014. In this regard Irish Water has advised that wastewater treatment works under the SWELL project have commenced at the Lifford project site, and are due to commence at the Carrigans and Killea project sites in the near future, while wastewater network upgrade works will commence in Omeath, Co. Louth later this year. Irish Water has further advised that all SWELL project works are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2021, and that it does not anticipate to encounter delays attributable to Covid-19.</p></reply>

It also provides continuing financial support for Heritage organisations including the Irish Architecture Foundation and the Irish Architectural Archive.</p>  <p>  2. The Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) sub-head, F7, makes provision for the BHIS capital grant scheme which provides grant aid to assist owners of heritage structures to meet their obligations to care for their properties. The scheme is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small-scale conservation projects and to support the employment of skilled conservation specialists. Earlier this year, I was delighted to announce &euro;3m investment through this scheme to assist 477 owners and custodians of historic and protected structures right across the country as they carry out small-scale, labour-intensive projects to repair and safeguard our built heritage. </p>  <p>3. Finally, in relation to funding to a specific organisation, subhead F6 provides for the Irish Heritage Trust (IHT). The Irish Heritage Trust was established to acquire, for public access, major heritage properties where there is an imminent risk to their heritage value. It is responsible for bringing these specific heritage properties to life and ensuring financial sustainability at each property in its care. Funding allocated to the IHT under this subhead enables it to fund its ongoing operations and to undertake urgent and important capital works that assist in conserving and sustainably developing the properties in its care, and matters germane thereto.  </p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p><p>Local Authority fire services in Ireland are provided by 3,200 professional, competent and highly committed personnel at all levels in 218 full-time and retained services. The numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even when staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in other areas of the local authority sector. </p><p>The prioritisation of work and effective management of all resources is, in the first instance, a matter for management in each of the fire services, based on their assessment of local needs and requirements. In relation to the staffing requirements in each local authority, under the Local Government Act, 2001 it is the responsibility of each Chief Executive to employ such staff and to make such staffing, funding, recruitment and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of their local authority. Vacancies arise in fire services in the normal course of events, due to retirements and resignations. Reports from fire services indicate that, currently, there are 124 vacancies in fire-fighter staff countrywide out of a staff total of 3,200. My Department has received no report of fire stations taken out of service due to vacancies and there is nothing to indicate that the overall level of fire service provision has been adversely affected by vacancies in recent years.  </p><p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, my Department has monitored regular reports from fire services, regarding the impact of the pandemic on staffing levels. During this period, necessary restrictions have limited opportunities for fire services to undertake recruitment and training activities in some cases. </p><p>I am aware that a number of fire stations were taken out of service for short periods during the pandemic, due to positive COVID-19 tests or precautionary isolation in case of suspected infection. Following testing, crews were permitted to return to duty.  </p><p>The fire stations concerned were:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Fire station</th>       <th>Date</th>       <th>Number of days out of service</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Naas, Co.

Kildare</td>       <td>March 2021</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In these cases, as always when a particular fire station is not available for any reason, fire cover was provided from the network of neighbouring fire stations during interruptions to service.  </p><p>Detailed data on the number of hours fire engines may be out of service, whether due to staffing, mechanical reasons of crew engagement in training or for other reasons, is not collected by, and consequently is not available in, my Department. The relevant information may be available from individual local authorities.</p></reply>

This year, funding was allocated to 139 projects across all local authorities to a value of just over &euro;4.2m.  It is hoped that this scheme will run again in 2022. Conditions and criteria for eligibility for application through the Local Authorities will be published at the time of the launch.  </p>  <p>  My Department also provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through two grant schemes which are, in the main, administered by the local authorities. These are the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Historic Structures Fund (HSF). This year some 562 heritage projects across every county in the country were allocated funding from a combined sum of &euro;6m under these schemes.

The quarterly publication is a comprehensive status report of social housing construction schemes for all local authority areas, with details such as the project locations and a range of information relating to their advancement, whether completed or on site or progressing through planning, design and construction.  The most recent publication covers the period up to the end of Q1 2021 and is available at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>While local authorities already have social housing construction programmes in train, I am keen that they add to their pipelines and, working with the Approved Housing Bodies, advance their existing projects as speedily as possible, with the assurance of the funding being available from my Department.  Details in respect of social housing delivery out to 2025, including social housing targets for 2022 onwards, will be set out in the new housing strategy that the Government will be publishing soon. The continued publication of the quarterly social housing construction status reports can give Councillors and public representatives the opportunity to work with local authority officials to press the advancement of these important projects.</p></reply>

The Programme commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing.  </p>  <p>  This commitment is reflected in Budget 2021, which provides for an overall investment of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing programmes.  This represents an increase of &euro;641m or 24% on 2020 and the single biggest spend on housing by any Government to fund the largest build programme, in the history of the State.  Importantly, &euro;110 million of this amount will be provided to deliver a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme for first time buyers and a new funding model to accelerate the delivery of cost rental homes through the Approved Housing Body sector. </p>  <p>  &euro;75 million is allocated for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, aimed at first-time buyers buying new-build homes on private land. It will enable first-time buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford, much sooner than would otherwise have been the case. The equity stake will fill the gap between the mortgage people can get, and the price of a new home. In so doing, it will build confidence in the construction sector to increase housing supply. The proposed price caps for the shared equity scheme are reflective of the median price of a new home bought by first-time buyers, and are targeted to address the affordability gap in different areas.  It is anticipated that the Scheme will be supported and operated in partnership with the retail banks - depending on the final design, this will allow support for c.1,500 to 2,000 households to buy new homes in the first year.</p>  <p>  The new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) is the first dedicated funding stream for Cost Rental housing in Ireland. CREL will assist Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in developing or acquiring new homes for Cost Rental, to accelerate implementation of this new housing sector in the immediate term. The scheme harnesses the expertise and capacity of AHBs, amply demonstrated in the provision of social housing, and builds a foundation for further AHB involvement in Cost Rental.</p>  <p>  Under the CREL scheme, the Housing Agency will make loans available to AHBs on very favourable terms to cover up to 30% of the development or acquisition costs of new homes for Cost Rental. The Budget allocation of &euro;35 million is intended to assist the delivery and tenanting of c. 350 new homes this year, in addition to the 50 new Cost Rental apartments scheduled for delivery later this year at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside.</p>  <p>  To date, Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) funding of almost &euro;200 million has been approved in principle in support of 40 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas across 9 counties, to assist in the delivery of almost 4,200 affordable homes for purchase or for rent.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Land Development Agency is tasked with working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, state agencies, and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. All these measures are designed to increase housing supply at a time when needed most. </p>  <p>  The Government has also approved the drafting of amending provisions to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for inclusion in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 as Committee Stage amendments. This will see an increase in the current 10% social housing requirement related to all new housing developments to a mandatory 20% for social and affordable requirements. </p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, both the Rebuilding Ireland Homeloan and the Help to Buy Scheme are available to eligible households seeking to purchase homes.</p>  <p>  The funding secured combined with the strong legislative underpinning I am putting in place will soon yield dividends, in the form of affordable housing delivery, in Dublin.  The forthcoming All-of-Government housing strategy &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo; will further detail an extensive range of measures and ambitious targets to underpin the delivery of affordable housing over the coming years. </p></reply>

At present, there are nearly 31,000 applications in the Foreign Births Registration (FBR) system that await processing.Prior to COVID-19 it took twelve to eighteen months to process applications. This was due to the complex nature of FBR applications and the very high volume of applications due to Brexit.</p><p>The Department is committed to allocating further resources to this service to assist with the high volume of applications when regular processing resumes with a focus on reducing turnaround times to pre Covid-19 levels by the end of 2021.</p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs operates a clear and transparent general policy with regard to the processing of Foreign Birth Registration.

Such applicants are advised on the Department&rsquo;s website to make contact with the Passport Service through the WebChat service.</p><p>Entitlement to Irish citizenship is determined by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 (&ldquo;the 1956 Act&rdquo;), as amended, under which Irish citizenship may be obtained by birth, by descent, or by naturalisation.</p><p>The 1956 Act provides, inter alia, that persons born abroad to parents who themselves were born abroad, are eligible for entry into the Foreign Births Register (FBR) if their parents were Irish citizens at the time of the person&rsquo;s birth.

Over the past 5 years alone, Ireland invested approximately &euro;200m to support Ethiopia&rsquo;s development and growth, with a focus on governance, health, agricultural development, social protection and humanitarian assistance. Our trusted relationships have been built with the Government, civil society and local communities across Ethiopia. Ireland has never had &quot;allegiance&quot; to the TPLF or any other group.</p><p>  It is in the context of this longstanding friendship and concern for the welfare of Ethiopia that the Government raises the human impact of the conflict in Tigray and we make no excuse for doing so. And we follow the same policy in relation to the terrible effects of conflicts in other parts of the world. Indeed conflict prevention, peacebuilding and support for humanitarian access to vulnerable conflict affected communities are cornerstones of Ireland's work at the UN Security Council.</p><p>I fully acknowledge the commitments made by the Ethiopian Government in respect of humanitarian action.  However, and notwithstanding these commitments, UN and other credible sources point to a continuing deterioration of the situation on the ground.</p><p>There are credible warnings of famine, and of attacks on humanitarian workers. Three aid workers were murdered last week. Since then, there have been significant developments, with Tigrayan forces reportedly entering the capital Mekelle and a declaration from the Ethiopian Government of a ceasefire to allow for planting by farmers.  I welcome this announcement, and hope it leads to a general cessation of violence.  UN OCHA has confirmed that 350,000 people in Tigray are in imminent danger of famine. UNICEF is warning that at least 33,000 severely malnourished children face death by starvation.</p><p>This is the context for Ireland's association with, and endorsement of, international calls for a humanitarian ceasefire, to enable planting and help avert the risk of famine. There is an urgent need for full humanitarian access.  All parties to the conflict must respect their obligations under international humanitarian law, which prohibit attacks directed against civilians. It is imperative that Eritrean forces leave Tigray immediately.  </p><p>Ireland continues to advocate for an effective response to the situation in Tigray, and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, through our bilateral engagement with Ethiopia, our EU Membership, and at the UN Security Council.  We maintain a full range of regular and ongoing contacts with Ethiopia, including in Dublin, Addis Ababa, the Permanent Missions to the United Nations in New York and Geneva, as well as in EU forums in Brussels.  Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Addis Ababa plays a key role in this regard, and Embassy officials have visited Tigray on a number of occasions. </p><p>When I met with Ethiopia&rsquo;s Ambassador to Ireland last month, we had a good exchange on the situation in his country, complementing Minister Coveney's discussions with Ethiopia&rsquo;s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. </p><p>Ireland continues to work on the Security Council to maintain a focus on the situation in Tigray. We have engaged closely with Ethiopia in this regard. Most recently, on 15 June, we called an informal meeting of the Security Council that focused on the humanitarian situation, in which Ethiopia participated.  In April, Ireland led the negotiation of a Council press statement on the situation in Tigray, the first time the Security Council spoke publicly on the crisis. We have made a joint request for a further Council meeting this week. </p><p>We also continue to closely monitor the wider situation in Ethiopia. On 21 June, Ethiopia undertook partial national elections. There were significant concerns among the international community, including the EU, that the situation on the ground was not conducive to a credible, inclusive and transparent electoral process. The planned EU Election Observation Mission was not deployed, as it was not possible to reach agreement with the Ethiopian authorities on essential parameters. Ireland supported local civil society organisations to monitor the election situation on the ground.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s continued priority will remain, as always, supporting the needs of the most vulnerable people in Ethiopia, including those affected by conflict in Tigray.  My Department, through the Irish Aid programme, has so far provided over &euro;3.2 million to support the humanitarian response in Tigray and the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, through our trusted UN and NGO partners on the ground.</p></reply>

As Minister, I am fully supportive of the objectives of the Working Holiday programmes and their important contribution in promoting people-to-people contacts, and am keen to see the programmes resume once circumstances allow.</p>  <p>  Since the onset of the pandemic, we have temporarily ceased processing new applications under the WHA programmes in the United States and Canada. While the relevant Missions in the United States and Canada continue to accept applications for WHAs, processing of applications is paused until circumstances sufficiently improve to allow the safe resumption of these two programmes. Submitted applications will remain on file and will be processed once operations resume. A primary concern remains the health, welfare and well-being of those who would seek to travel to Ireland on a WHA. A range of public health restrictions remain in place in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Ireland. This situation is kept under regular review, and the Department will continue to monitor the situation in Ireland, in conjunction with colleagues in other relevant Departments, with a view to re-opening these programmes as soon as circumstances allow. </p>  <p>  At the present time, it is the view that circumstances do not yet allow for the processing of new WHA applications in a manner consistent with public health guidance and the aims of these two WHA programmes. </p>  <p>We continue to monitor the evolving situation here and in the United States and Canada, in terms particularly of public health advice, travel restrictions, job opportunities and the availability of short-term accommodation. Our Missions in the United States and Canada will be instructed to resume processing applications when circumstances allow young people to benefit from a working holiday here and to fully experience Ireland&rsquo;s culture and way of life. A public announcement will be made as soon as application processing resumes.   </p></reply>

The fostering of a positive working environment is a guiding principle for the implementation of our strategic objectives. My Department&rsquo;s HR Strategy 2019-2022 included &lsquo;Building a Positive, Diverse and Innovative Workplace&rsquo; as one of its four goals. This inclusion aligns both with my Department&rsquo;s values and with the central Irish Civil Service Renewal Plan and underscores our commitment to fostering equality and respect for human rights in the Department&rsquo;s workplace. Under our Customer Service Charter, we are committed to treating everyone fairly and impartially. We also require that our staff be treated with respect.</p>  <p>  A key governance structure for the fulfilment of our obligations under the 2014 Act is the Management Board Sub-Committee on Gender, Equality, Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion (GEDI), which is chaired by two members of the Management Board. The Sub-Committee, in cooperation with Human Resources Division and other units of my Department, progresses initiatives and runs regular events to promote, inter alia, the goals of equality at home and through our Mission network overseas. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to proofing our policies, procedures and services across our business areas to ensure that we comply with our requirements in the area of human rights and equality. To this end, the Statement of Strategy 2021-23 commits my Department to conduct an assessment of the human rights and equality issues relevant to its functions. This will enable us to identify further concrete actions that can be taken to ensure that we comply with our obligations under the 2014 Act. This work is already underway, with the initial stage focused on our HR policies and practices. </p>  <p>There are no bodies or agencies under the remit of my Department.  </p></reply>

This letter specifically references the plight of those wishing to apply for student and exchange visas.</p>  <p>  Ireland is deeply committed to supporting exchanges between our two countries at every level. These play an essential role in building transatlantic understanding and extraordinary academic links.

We have continued to raise these matters in our engagement with successive US Administrations, Members of US Congress and leaders from across the political spectrum. The Taoiseach raised the matter in March this year directly with President Biden during his St. Patrick's Day virtual visit. He also discussed the issue of the E3 visa bill, and of creating pathways to citizenship, with the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.</p>  <p>  I am glad to see that immigration issues, including possible pathways to citizenship, are a priority for the President as demonstrated by his proposed US Citizenship Act of 2021. We continue to pursue the E3 Visa Bill, which, if passed, could allow access to thousands of US visas each year to Irish citizens, providing new opportunities to live and work in the US. Our Embassy in Washington D.C. continues its extensive outreach in support of the Bill, working with a range of Members of the US House of Representatives and the Senate. We will seek the reintroduction of the Bill to Congress at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  Through Our Embassy in Washington D.C., as well as our Consulates across the US, we engage regularly with Irish representative groups in the US, particularly the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers. The Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers receives significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme. Furthermore, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable. In 2020, over &euro;4.25m was paid to diaspora organisations in the US for ESP and Covid-19 related projects.</p>  <p>  We will continue to support and engage with these groups, which support the needs of Irish citizens in the US.

It is a standing item on the agenda of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning which I Chair where it is always a key topic of discussion.</p>  <p>  The response to cyber threats is a whole-of-Government challenge, with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications taking the lead role and with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, is the primary authority responsible for cyber security in the State, including incident response, cyber resilience and information provision. While the primary role of the Defence Forces with regard to Cyber Security relates to the defence and security of its own networks and systems, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the Cyber Security of the State. This is being done in line with the Programme for Government commitment to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy, recognizing the potential and important role of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s current National Cyber Security Strategy? was published in December 2019 and it follows on from the country's first Strategy which was issued in 2015. The current Strategy also reflects the operational experience gained by the National Cyber Security Centre since it was established in 2011, and from ongoing national and international engagements in the area. Department of Defence officials and the Defence Forces inputted to the drawing up of this Strategy.</p>  <p>  Department officials and members of the Defence Forces are actively involved in the implementation of the new Strategy which, in conjunction with the White Paper on Defence 2015, will continue to inform our engagement in this critical area. This includes work to develop an updated, detailed risk assessment of the current vulnerability of all Critical National Infrastructure and services to cyber-attacks and the secondment of a member of the Defence Forces to the Cyber Security Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia. My Officials are also part of the steering group developing a Baseline Cyber Security Standard for Government Departments and Agencies, they participate in the UK-Ireland Critical National Infrastructure Cyber Cooperation Working Group and my officials also actively participate on the Inter-Departmental Committee overseeing the overall  implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have a Memorandum of Understanding and a Service Level Agreement with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to provide support in the area of national cyber security. The overall aim is to improve the cyber security of the State through various types of assistance and support while also ensuring the operational requirements of the Defence Forces are prioritised, including the ongoing sharing of information and analyses of risks. </p>  <p>  I would also add that my Department implements a programme of continuous review in relation to ICT security in order to keep up to date with current threat levels given that cyber security is a multi-facetted challenge that is constantly evolving. Details of measures taken are not publicised for security reasons.  </p>  <p>  While it would also be inappropriate for me to comment on the specific cyber activities and the resourcing of same by the Defence Forces, for both security and operational reasons, I can inform the Deputy that the priority for the Defence Forces Communications and Information Services Corps is the protection of the Defence Forces Communications Network. Other activities undertaken by the CIS Corps include the monitoring and handling of cyber incidents, the enhancement of Defence Forces cyber situational awareness and the provision of cyber awareness training.  </p></reply>

A key function of the National Cyber Security Centre is to support the management of major cyber security incidents and it is leading on the response to the current cyber attack.</p>  <p>  While the Defence Forces primary role relates to the defence and security of its own network, they along with the Department of Defence are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the Cyber Security of the State. Both officials from my Department and members of the Defence Forces are actively participating in the implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy. </p>  <p>  My officials and members of the Defence Forces are actively involved in the preparation of a National Cyber Risk Assessment which will support the development of resilience in Ireland&rsquo;s National Infrastructure by identifying vulnerabilities which could lead to systemic cyber risks. </p>  <p>  In addition, a member of the Defence Forces is currently seconded to the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and has been deployed to the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence based in Tallinn, Estonia. This is the first time Ireland has had a representative in this Centre.</p>  <p>  Whilst the Defence Forces are not a primary response agency for non-security related emergencies, as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department or Principal Response Agency in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to Civil Authority (ATCA) role.  </p>  <p>  In that regard, in response to the recent cyber attack on the HSE, the Defence Forces are providing technical support to the HSE through the deployment of a number of Computer Incident Response Teams (CIRT) to assist in the recovery of IT systems.  </p>  <p>  From a security and an operational perspective it would be inappropriate to provide the details of the capability that the Defence Forces have in cyber security. I can however confirm that there is on-going development of cyber capabilities within the Defence Forces.  </p></reply>

The Defence Forces offer significant career opportunities and whilst pay has been highlighted as an issue, there has been significant progress in recent years.</p><p>Public Service pay policy is determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform having regard to Public Sector Pay Agreements. The Department of Defence does not have discretion to award separate pay increases. </p><p>The Defence Forces have received pay increases in line with the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the most recent of which was a 2% increase on annualised salaries from 1<sup>st</sup>October 2020.  </p><p>The restoration of the 5% cut in allowances imposed under the Financial Emergency in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation, was also restored from 1st October 2020.  </p><p>In addition to the general round of pay increases awarded to public servants, members of the Permanent Defence Force have also benefitted from the implementation of increases in Defence Forces allowances as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission. These included:</p><p>- a 10% increase in military service allowance,</p><p>- the restoration of a 10% cut applied to a number of Defence Forces allowances under the Haddington Road Pay Agreement</p><p>- the restoration of premium rates for weekend security duty allowances.</p><p>- the restoration of a service commitment scheme for pilots.</p><p>The introduction of a new sea-going service commitment scheme for Naval Service personnel came into effect from 1<sup>st</sup>January 2021, is aimed at retaining highly trained and experienced personnel and incentivising sea going duties.</p><p>A sea going naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270 was applied in the 2020 tax year for members of the Naval Service who served 80 days or more at sea on board a naval vessel in 2019. This tax credit has been extended for a further year and is increased to &euro;1,500 for the 2021 tax year.  </p><p>Negotiations on a new public service agreement were held in late 2020 with public service trade unions and representative associations. A new agreement &lsquo;<i>Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo; </i>has subsequently been ratified by the overwhelming majority of public sector unions. The Permanent Defence Force representative associations have yet to ballot their members and accordingly advise the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) of formal acceptance, or otherwise, of this agreement.  </p><p>The agreement provides for further increases in pay to all public servants including members of the Defence Forces should the Representative Associations advise the WRC of formal acceptance of the agreement.</p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on October 2021.</p><p>- The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1 February 2022.</p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater on, 1 October 2022.</p><p>The Government remains fully committed to addressing pay and conditions in the Defence Forces and this is reflected in the Programme for Government. This provided for the establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces, which was established on the 15<sup>th</sup>December 2020 and completion of the Commissions work, I will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a a permanent pay review body for the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

For national security reasons, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the nature of the HSE cyberattack at this time, it does illustrate how vital it is that we take cyber security issues very seriously.</p>  <p>  Ireland ranks among the leading EU Member States in terms of the uptake and use of digital technologies. These technologies play a central role in supporting our economic and social life. Our geographic position, our open economy and our EU membership means that we now host a large amount of data and economic activity. COVID-19 also means that people are relying on technology more than ever to stay connected. The development of the Information and Communications Technology that support all this activity introduces a new set of complex and evolving risks. Infrastructure of any kind attached to the Internet is vulnerable to threats from anywhere on Earth. </p>  <p>  Disruption to our digital assets and critical infrastructure brings significant economic costs and undermines trust and confidence in them. Threats emanate from both individuals and Nation States and can also have national security implications.</p>  <p>  It is vital that we work closely with our partners in the European Union on cyber security issues and so I welcome the proposal made last week by the European Commission to build a new Joint Cyber Unit to tackle the rising number of serious cyber incidents impacting public services as well as the life of businesses and citizens across the EU. The proposed Joint Cyber Unit represents an opportunity to bring together cybersecurity communities including civilian, law enforcement, diplomatic and cyber defence communities. We in the Government will be examining this proposal in depth since, while Ireland welcomes it, it does represent a potentially very substantial requirement for additional resourcing, both in terms of financial resources and skillsets, on behalf of Member States. </p>  <p>  Another recent positive development at the international level is that G7 Members have put ransomware on the global agenda. Given the threat presented by ransomware, it is clear that a coordinated response will be necessary, between Governments and with other relevant stakeholders including the private sector, academics and civil society.</p>  <p>  I would also like to highlight that a very important debate is taking place this week at the United Nations Security Council today on maintaining international peace and security in cyberspace. The Taoiseach is representing Ireland at this event.</p>  <p>  While the primary role of the Defence Forces with regard to Cyber Security relates to the defence and security of its own networks and systems, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the Cyber Security of the State. This is being done in line with the Programme for Government commitment to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy, recognizing the potential and important role of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  That is why officials in my Department and members of the Defence Forces work so closely with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and other Government Departments and Agencies to support measures to deal with these challenges. I would also like to highlight that a member of the Defence Forces is currently seconded to the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia. The Centre is involved in carrying out cyber-defence focused training awareness campaigns, workshops, and courses and developing and conducting cyber defence-focused exercises.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would note that the establishment of an independent Commission on the Defence Forces underpins the Government's commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces are fit for purpose, both in terms of meeting immediate requirements and also in terms of seeking to develop a longer term vision beyond 2030. Amongst the issues that the Commission is examining are Defence Force capabilities, structures and staffing in a number of areas. I expect that a report will be produced for consideration by Government before the end of the year.</p></reply>

However, on a routine basis the Air Corps monitors and communicates with foreign military aircraft where such aircraft are flying in the airspace in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, where air traffic control is provided by the Defence Forces.  </p>  <p>  The IAA exercises Air Traffic Control responsibilities for an airspace of some 450,000 sq. kms comprising of both sovereign airspace and also airspace over the high seas, largely off the western seaboard. All air traffic, both civil and military, is monitored and controlled by the IAA in respect of this airspace and in line with ICAO rules it is normal practice for the IAA to be informed by the relevant State of any military flights operating in Irish controlled airspace.</p>  <p>  The Department of Transport has overall responsibility for the development and formulation of national policy in the field of aviation security, and for aviation security obligations under all national and international legislation.

The EDP includes reference to a primary radar project. Consideration of this project will be prioritised should additional appropriate funding become available. The overall priorities in the EDP will remain under review as it is progressively implemented and taking account of funding availability.  </p>  <p>  Acquisition of primary radar capability would have to be assessed against the significant investment of public funds, in respect of both the initial investment and the on-going operational costs, which would have to be considered alongside other spending priorities and the nature of the threats Ireland faces.</p></reply>

This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. The current position regarding the major equipment platform projects is as follows.</p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade of the Army&rsquo;s fleet of 80 General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles is well underway.   This programme is on-going and continues to command significant resources and commitment of effort.  The vehicle, which is the backbone of Defence Forces armoured capability, has been well proven in all its roles since the first vehicles were introduced in 2001.  To date, some 54 vehicles have been upgraded including modernisation of protection systems and weapons. The overall programme is due to be completed by 2023. In addition, an order for 28 Armoured Utility Vehicles AUVs was recently placed with Centigon, a French company, and these will provide a level of protected mobility between the levels of soft-skinned light transport and heavier armoured vehicles. Delivery of these vehicles is expected to complete in 2021.</p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet.  In 2019, a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3/4 tonne 4X4 vehicles, the first of which entered service in early 2020.  In March of last year, a tender process was completed for the supply of one hundred and twenty (120) new 4X4 Troop Carrying Vehicles, with the award of a contract to Westward Scania, based in Strokestown, Co. Roscommon.  The first vehicles were delivered in Q1 2021 with delivery of all 120 vehicles concluding by 2023.  Funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment. In July of 2020 a tender competition was commenced for the supply of Software Defined Radios to the Defence Forces and the competition is currently underway. The scope of the project consists of two main requirements; Personal Soldier Radios and Multi-Band Handheld, Manpack, Vehicular and Airborne radios. Given the complexity of the requirements, the procurement process is expected to be comprehensive in nature with the first radios not expected to enter service before 2023.</p>  <p>  A step change in military air-based capability is being achieved through the delivery into service of Pilatus PC-12 aircraft.  While nominally a replacement for the Cessna, the new aircraft move capabilities considerably ahead of the previous level.  The original order of three aircraft which were delivered in September 2020 was augmented on an urgent basis by an additional aircraft delivered in April 2020 to enhance fixed wing capacity to meet demands arising from Covid-19.  The PC-12 has proven itself an effective and versatile asset.</p>  <p>  The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.</p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence also sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class vessels, L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh, as well as, in due course, the replacement of L&Eacute; Eithne.  The P50 mid-life upgrade programme is well underway, with the recent return to operations of L&Eacute; Rois&iacute;n and work commencing on L&Eacute; Niamh.  The replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) is the next scheduled component of the White Paper fleet investment programme.   Projects for other vessel replacement will be considered over the life-time of the White Paper in the context of overall capability development and funding and the Equipment Development Plan (EDP) process.  The MRV project is currently underway and will be progressed over the coming years. </p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available.  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence was increased to &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million. Budget 2021 provides for a further increased gross allocation to &euro;131m in the defence capital budget in respect of equipment and barracks infrastructure.  This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

The Defence Forces continue to carry out the roles assigned by Government, including security operations, critical supports to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ATCA supports to other Government Departments and Principal Response Agencies. In particular, in recent times, the Defence Forces have played an important role in the Covid 19 response through providing a broad range of supports to the HSE.  </p>  <p>  My priority as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Defence Forces is maintained to enable the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service to carry out their roles as assigned by Government. </p>  <p>  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency. </p>  <p>  In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, primary responsibility for responding to emergencies such as severe weather events or terrorist attacks rests with the three designated principal response agencies, namely, the relevant Local Authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Health Service Executive. The Defence Forces provides assistance within means to the appropriate Lead Department or Principal Response Agency in the event of a natural disaster or an emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) and Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) roles. Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these Plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  In respect of security threats, responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In that regard, among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2015) is the provision of ATCP which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. There is on-going and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and includes military training activities which are specifically designed to respond to possible security emergencies. Regular coordination and liaison meetings also take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces retain a wide range of specialist skills and equipment which are available for deployment in response to any emergencies that may arise. Training is also an important aspect of maintaining the necessary capabilities in the Defence Forces. The Defence Forces deliver military training programmes and modules meeting national and international standards. They also engage with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning. This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retain currency with regards to best international practice and employ all relevant modern training methods.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the personnel of the Defence Forces continue to be equipped and trained to best international standards and I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats and emergencies under constant review. I am satisfied that the Defence Forces will continue to respond in an effective and timely manner to such events were they to occur in the state.</p></reply>

It provides the defence policy framework for the period up to 2025.  This policy framework is designed to be flexible and responsive given the dynamic nature of the security environment and enables the Defence Organisation to be adaptive to changing circumstances and to use resources as efficiently as possible.  </p>  <p>  Within this context, the White Paper contains the Government's decision to put in place a fixed cycle of defence reviews.  The first such review, the White Paper on Defence - Update 2019, which was approved by Government, was published in December 2019 and includes an updated assessment of the security environment.  Threats in the cyber domain, and from espionage, are assessed as increasing, while the wider political global environment is now more complex and uncertain.  Changes since the 2015 White Paper are also addressed, including human resource issues, implementation of commitments made in the White Paper and capability developments.  </p>  <p>  While the Update acknowledges that there are challenges in certain areas, it affirms the fundamentals of our approach to defence policy that were settled when the White Paper was approved in 2015.    The next iteration in the fixed cycle of reviews is to be a Strategic Defence Review. </p>  <p>  In order to further consider the medium and longer term defence requirements of the State, a commitment was given in the Programme for Government to establish an Independent Commission on the Defence Forces.  This Commission and it's terms of reference were approved by Government in December last year.  The Commission subsequently commenced their work and will continue to work throughout 2021 with their report due in December 2021.  The Commission will review matters such as the structure of the Defence Forces, pay and allowances structures, recruitment retention and career progression and the contribution of the Reserve Defence Force.   The work of the Commission will inform the future development of the Defence Forces. </p></reply>

The Department of Defence does not have discretion to award separate pay increases. Whilst pay has been highlighted as an issue, there has been significant progress in recent years. </p><p>The Defence Forces have received pay increases in line with the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the most recent of which was a 2% increase on annualised salaries from 1 October 2020. </p><p>The restoration of the 5% cut in allowances imposed under the Financial Emergency in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation, was also restored from 1 October 2020. </p><p>In addition to the general round of pay increases awarded to public servants, members of the Permanent Defence Force have also benefitted from the implementation of increases in Defence Forces allowances as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission. These included: </p><p>- a 10% increase in military service allowance, </p><p>- the restoration of a 10% cut applied to a number of Defence Forces allowances under the Haddington Road Pay Agreement </p><p>- the restoration of premium rates for weekend security duty allowances. </p><p>- the restoration of a service commitment scheme for pilots. </p><p>The introduction of a new sea-going service commitment scheme for Naval Service personnel came into effect from 1 January 2021, is aimed at retaining highly trained and experienced personnel and incentivising sea going duties.</p><p>A sea going naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270 was applied in the 2020 tax year for members of the Naval Service who served 80 days or more at sea on board a naval vessel in 2019. This tax credit has been extended for a further year and is increased to &euro;1,500 for the 2021 tax year. </p><p>Negotiations on a new public service agreement were held in late 2020 with public service trade unions and representative associations. A new agreement &lsquo;<i>Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo;</i>has subsequently been ratified by the overwhelming majority of public sector unions. The Permanent Defence Force representative associations have yet to ballot their members and accordingly advise the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) of formal acceptance, or otherwise, of this agreement. </p><p>The agreement provides for further increases in pay to all public servants including members of the Defence Forces should the Representative Associations advise the WRC of formal acceptance of the agreement. </p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salary for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on 1 October 2021. </p><p>- The equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund, in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement, on 1 February 2022. </p><p>- A general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is greater on, 1 October 2022.</p><p>The Government remains fully committed to addressing pay and conditions in the Defence Forces and this is reflected in the Programme for Government. This provided for the establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces, which was established on the 15 December 2020 and completion of the Commissions work, I will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a a permanent pay review body for the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

In such circumstances, this should be part of a transition or reintegration intervention, based on the needs of individual students. </p><p>Where a reduced timetable is used, it should be applied proportionately, should have signed parental/guardian consent and should last only as long as is necessary to facilitate a return to school on a full-time basis.  </p><p>The Department has consulted with education stakeholders to consider the timing of the introduction of guidelines on reduced timetables in the context of Covid 19 and the current operating environment for schools. There were concerns about issuing guidelines in the current Covid context where the safe and sustainable reopening of schools remains the overriding priority for all stakeholders. </p><p>It is my Department&rsquo;s intention to issue Guidelines to schools on the use of reduced timetables for the next school year.</p><p>It is intended that the guidelines will include measures by which schools will be required to report on the use of reduced timetables. </p><p>Until such time as this reporting mechanism is in place, data is not available as to the number of pupils who are currently on reduced timetables.</p><p>In relation to the number of appeals taken under Section 29 of the Education Act against suspension or refusal to enrol pupils with special educational needs, Section 7 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018 came into operation on the 12 November 2020 and provided for the replacement of the existing Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 with a series of new sections numbered 29 to 29F. </p><p>These new appeal provisions in sections 29 to 29F are designed to work alongside the wider admissions framework in the 2018 Act. In accordance with section 29B of the Education Act, 1998, the Minister also developed procedures for appeals which apply to all appeals submitted from 12 November 2020 onwards.</p><p>Since the commencement of the new arrangements for appeals on the 12 November 2020 to date, a total of 95 appeals have been taken under section 29 of the Education Act 2018 where the applicant has indicated that the child has special educational needs. This represents 29% of all appeals in the same period.</p><p>Prior to 12 November only data in relation to total numbers of appeals per appeal type was recorded and therefore the Department cannot provide data in relation to the numbers of appeals which related to children with special educational needs for previous years. </p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 2018 allows for appeals against the decision of a Board of Management of a school to suspend or permanently exclude a student. The decision of the independent appeals committee in such appeals may only be challenged by way of a Judicial Review. It is open to either party to an appeal to seek a Judicial Review.</p><p>My Department has recorded the following number of Judicial Reviews of section 29 appeal decisions in suspension and expulsion cases involving children with special educational needs in the last 3 years and to date in 2021:</p><p>2021 - 1 expulsion case</p><p>2020 &ndash; 2 expulsion cases</p><p>2019 - 3 expulsion cases and 1 suspension case</p><p>2018 &ndash; 0 cases</p><p>In relation to the number of pupils with special educational needs who may be currently on suspension, expulsion, or out of school, and for whom Section 29 cases may not have been brought forward, I wish to advise the Deputy that in accordance with the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 schools are obliged to report on school attendance, and data on non-attendance in primary and post-primary schools at the aggregated level are collected by Tusla through the Annual Attendance Report (AAR) and, also at the student level through the Student Attendance Report (SAR). </p><p>This latest report published presents data for the academic year 2017/18 and is available on Tusla&rsquo;s website at <i>www.tusla.ie/uploads/content/Analysis_of_School_Attendance_Data_in_Primary_and_Post-Primary_Schools_2017-2018.pdf</i>.</p><p>As the information requested is collected and recorded by Tusla, I have referred this part of the question to that agency, for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy. </p><p>Finally, in respect of children with special educational needs who may not be suspended or expelled, but who may be without a school placement, I can advise that ensuring that every child has a suitable school placement is a key objective of my Department.  Significant resources are allocated each year to ensure that appropriate supports are available for children with special educational needs.</p><p>It is the policy of my Department that all children with Special Educational Needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. </p><p>Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s policy focuses on ensuring that all students with special educational needs can have access to an education appropriate to meeting their needs and abilities.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers (SENOs), for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements. </p><p>In circumstances, where the NCSE confirms that no placement is available for a child with special educational needs, my Department can provide Home Tuition grant funding towards the provision of 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until the NCSE confirms that a placement is available. </p><p>It is important to note that Home tuition funding is not an alternative to a school placement, by its nature it is intended to be a short term intervention. </p><p>For this reason home tuition will not be available where a school placement has been identified by the NCSE.  </p><p>Similarly, failure to enrol a child in school will not give rise to eligibility under this scheme.</p><p>I have no plans to change this approach.  </p><p>Where the NCSE have identified an available school placement for a child, the local SENO will continue to be available to engage with the family and the school concerned to ensure that the child's needs are addressed.</p><p>The total number of children with special educational needs who are being supported by the Home Tuition scheme on the grounds that they do not currently have a school placement, or an early intervention class placement, is 732. <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Sanctioned</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>SEN school aged no placement</td>       <td>88</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3+ (Early Intervention support)</td>       <td>522</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 During year</td>       <td>37</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6+</td>       <td>85</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>732</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports.  </p><p>This policy is supported by significant investment by Government, &euro;2bn or just under 25% of the total education spend.  This funds the provision of additional teachers, special needs assistants and other supports required to enable children with special needs to access education. </p><p>Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for.</p><p>It is therefore not the case that special educational placements are required to support all children with special educational needs, nor is it intended that this should be the case. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements. </p><p>My Department will continue to provide for a continuum of provision, which includes special class and special school places for children who have been assessed as needing such placements.</p><p>Through better planning at both national and local level, it is my objective that specialist education places should come on stream to meet emerging demand on a timely basis. However, the active collaboration of school communities is essential in this regard. </p><p>Through ongoing consultation at local level, the NCSE is also aware of those parents whose children have been seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement throughout the country including the areas in question. The NCSE continues to work to identify any and all relevant suitable placements.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) continue to be available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. </p><p>Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: <i>ncse.ie/regional-servic</i>.</p></reply>

Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited. The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided. </p><p>In relation to applications for an exceptional review of the SNA allocation for the 2021/22 school year, schools with no SNAs and developing schools are being prioritised and determinations made before 30 June 2021. Other applications will be processed in order of date received. Schools are advised in writing once the outcome of reviews are known.</p><p>The NCSE have confirmed that 1,488 applications for exceptional reviews were received from schools during the 2020/21 school year. Of these applications, 772 schools have received an increase amounting to 539.39 additional SNA posts.</p></reply>

It is an analysis of historic population and enrolment trends for the period 2011-2020 in the East Cork area.  The area in question is primarily the Midleton_Carrigtwohill school planning area, though part of the Youghal school planning area is also considered.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a new primary school and a new post primary school have both been established in Midleton_Carrigtwohill in that period to meet the school needs arising from that population growth: Scoil Cliodhna CNS which was established in 2015 and Carrigtwohill Community College which was established in 2016. </p>  <p>  In addition increased capacity is being provided in St Aloysius College, St. Mary High School, St. Colman&rsquo;s Community College and in Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide to meet September 2021 requirements as well as long-term projected enrolments in the east Cork area. </p>  <p>  While the referenced report details historic information, the Deputy will appreciate that the provision of additional school accommodation is predicated on the projection of school place requirements based on current and future demographic trends.  My Department uses up to date data from a range of sources including enrolments, Child Benefit data, information on residential development activity and National Planning Framework population targets in order to anticipate school place needs.  The most current analysis does not indicate a requirement for additional school accommodation provision in the Midleton_Carrigtwohill or Youghal school planning areas above that which is currently being planned and delivered.  Nevertheless, school place requirements will continue to be kept under review.</p></reply>

The curriculum in second level schools must meet an extensive range of needs in catering for the cognitive, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social, physical and moral development of students, and in preparing them for the demands of citizenship, lifelong learning and social and economic participation. Key messages arising from evaluations of the curriculum relate to overload, and the need to make more time and space for active learning and the acquisition of core skills.</p>  <p>  The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, which is currently mandatory for primary and Junior Cycle students, is focused on promoting the health and well-being of children. Teachers can include CPR/first-aid in their SPHE programme, however, it is not a mandatory component. Personal safety is currently addressed in a variety of ways in the primary and post primary curricula. For example, SPHE aims to develop student&rsquo;s skills for keeping safe and to make students aware of appropriate responses to various threats to personal safety. This provides schools with opportunities to prioritise first aid if they consider this appropriate to meet the needs of their students.</p>  <p>  At Junior Cycle, the curriculum is made up of a combination of full subjects and short courses.  Short courses are designed for 100 hours of engagement over the three years of Junior Cycle. Some short courses will be designed centrally by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and others by schools themselves or other bodies, using the template provided by the NCCA.  It is therefore open to a school or other body to develop a short course in first aid training, for use in schools.  </p>  <p>  There are also opportunities within Transition Year in which a flexible menu of learning modules can be provided by schools within the context of a framework for the programme set out by the Department. As part of this, it is open to schools to provide first aid training if they wish to do so.</p>  <p>Schools are encouraged to engage with community groups and a wide range of stakeholders to provide for extra-curricular learning opportunities such as first-aid training or to give talks to students. It is the policy of this Department not to endorse any products or programmes produced by external parties for use in schools, irrespective of whether these are for commercial purposes or are freely available to schools. It is the responsibility of each individual school to select the materials and resources that it will use to support its implementation of the curriculum.  </p></reply>

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.   The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  </p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  </p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  </p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  </p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. </p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.</p>  <p>  Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. </p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  </p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in our schools and is tailored to their needs.  The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future. There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools. This course is fully funded by the Department of Education. </p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.  This would deal with a number of matters including the identification of need and the provision of appropriate training programmes.  The issue of programme accreditation will be considered further in this context.  </p></reply>

I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including secretaries and caretakers. </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented and increased funding was provided by my Department. </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the claim. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. The parties continue to engage under the auspices of the WRC and I support meaningful engagement on this issue by all parties.</p></reply>

Music Generation focuses on the provision of performance music education &ndash; that is, the breadth of vocal and instrumental learning in all genres and styles of music. This includes all pedagogical approaches and practices appropriate to particular musical cultures and traditions, and is delivered by professional musician teachers. </p><p>The Department has a total of &euro;6.485m funding allocated for Music Generation in 2021.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.  The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  </p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  </p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  </p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  </p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  </p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. </p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.</p>  <p>  Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. </p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  </p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  </p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in our schools and is tailored to their needs.  The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future. There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools. This course is fully funded by the Department of Education. </p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.  This would deal with a number of matters including the identification of need and the provision of appropriate training programmes.  The issue of programme accreditation will be considered further in this context.  </p></reply>

The Appeal is pending, awaiting an outcome.</p>  <p>  The Benefit Payment for 65 Year Olds, provided under the Jobseekers Benefit scheme, has been introduced in line with the Programme for Government commitment,  to address the position of people who are required to or choose to retire at age 65 before the pension age of 66. </p>  <p>  This new benefit payment is designed to bridge the gap for people who retire from employment or self-employment at 65 until they qualify for the State Pension at age 66.  Recipients of the payment are not required to sign on, engage in activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work which is normally the case for recipients of a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment. </p>  <p>  To be eligible for the payment a person must satisfy the qualifying conditions of the scheme including the PRSI social insurance contribution requirement.</p>  <p>  A person must have paid 104 PRSI insurable employment contributions at class A, H or P or paid 156 class S contributions if they are self-employed. The second contribution condition requires that a person must also have 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the Governing Contribution Year (GCY). The GCY for 2021 is 2019. At least 13 of these contributions must be paid. Where a person does not have 13 paid contributions in the GCY they can be from 2 years before the GCY, the last complete tax year or the current tax year. Alternatively, a person could qualify if they have at least 26 reckonable contributions paid in both the GCY and the year immediately preceding the GCY.</p>  <p>In accordance to the records of the Department the last paid PRSI contribution for the person concerned was in 2015.</p></reply>

The contract agreement between the Department and the CE sponsoring authorities establishes their role as independent contractors.  CE sponsoring authorities are the legal employers of CE supervisors, CE assistant supervisors and CE participants.  </p>  <p>  The CE sponsoring authorities receive state funding to cover the salary costs of supervisors, assistant supervisors and participant remuneration, training and material costs from the Department.  CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors are not public servants or employees of the Department or the state. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors have been seeking for several years, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors who are employed by CE schemes.   </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has to have regard to any potential Exchequer exposure associated with the specific issue relating solely to CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendation.  </p>  <p>  Within this context, officials from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform held discussions on proposals to progress and resolve this issue over the past number of months, while having regard to the wider budgetary framework.  Officials from my Department also held discussions with unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.</p>  <p>  The current status is that an agreement was reached between my colleagues, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on proposals to resolve the long-standing issue. Details of these proposals were forwarded to the unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.  My Department officials are engaging with the unions on the basis of this proposal.   Given the nature of discussions with unions and the complex issues involved, it is not possible to give  a date for when these discussions will conclude.  However, my officials are progressing this matter with the relevant unions as a priority and I would hope that these discussions can reach a conclusion in the near future.</p></reply>

This seeks to ensure that victims of domestic violence are not prevented from leaving their home because of financial or accommodation difficulties.  The arrangements in this protocol are additional and complementary to, and not a substitution for, the range of other supports already in place for victims of domestic violence. </p>  <p>  There are currently 62 victims of domestic violence being supported with rent supplement under these arrangements. </p>  <p>  Under the protocol, after six months period of support, it is expected that the customer will, if eligible, be able to migrate to HAP or other social housing supports supported by their local authority. </p>  <p>  In line with the National Economic Recovery Plan, these special arrangements  for victims of domestic abuse will remain in place at least until the end of the year.

The maximum payment duration for IB is two years. Persons on IB may apply for Invalidity Pension (IP) if they are  permanently incapable of work or have been incapable of work for at least 12 months and are likely to be incapable of work for at least another 12 months. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that it is not a requirement that a person needs to be in receipt of IB in order to apply for IP.</p>  <p>  IP is a long-term payment for persons who are permanently incapable of work and who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions - it is not means tested.  To be eligible a person must  have not less than 260 weeks contributions paid and not less than 48 weeks contributions paid or credited in the last or second last complete tax year.  </p>  <p>  Persons in receipt of IP are also eligible for the Free Travel Scheme (free travel pass).  They may also qualify for other secondary benefits such as the fuel allowance, living alone increase and the household benefits package.</p>  <p>  Blind Pension is one of two means-tested disability related payments provided by the Department.  As at the end of April 2021 there were almost 155,000 persons in receipt of these payments, comprising 153,805 in receipt of the Disability Allowance and 1,069 in receipt of the Blind Pension. </p>  <p>  The Blind Pension is paid, subject to the means test, to blind people and certain people with low vision, aged between 18 and 66, who are habitually resident in the State.  </p>  <p>  The assessment of means reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of income or capital are in a position to use these resources to support themselves, so that social welfare expenditure can be directed towards those who need it most. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the two scheme types - the social insurance benefits (Illness Benefit and Invalidity Pension) and the social assistance payments (Disability Allowance and Blind pension) are fundamentally different: the former are payments based on PRSI contributions made, while the latter are means tested payments.  It would not be appropriate to provide automatic access from one to the other. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that for those in financial difficulty, the Supplementary Welfare Allowance, including Urgent Needs Payments or Exceptional Needs Payments, are available through my department's Intreo centres.  This is a means-tested payment administered by this Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep the range of supports available under review.  The Deputy will be aware that any proposed change would need to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

The service providers are paid on the basis of performance and with the exception of the initial registration fee, payments are made only when a client has achieved sustained employment.  The registration fee is a fee payable for engagement and is only payable when the JobPath service providers engage and agree a Personal Progression Plan (PPP) with the client. </p>  <p>  Since the JobPath service began in 2015, there have been a total number of 300,103 registration fees paid to the JobPath service providers to date.  Of the total number of jobseekers who have engaged with the service during this period, some 259,644 had either completed or were expected to complete their engagement with JobPath </p>  <p>  During this same period, July 2015 and end of April 2021, 67,657 Jobseekers had commenced employment during their engagement and, of these, almost 24,000 thus far have sustained full time employment for a period of 52 weeks or more. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are in the first phase of the service and have not spent sufficient time with the service to have either gained employment or sustain that employment for up to 52 weeks. It should also be noted that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the numbers gaining and sustaining employment. </p></reply>

It is a cross-government approach, bringing together actions by Government Departments and Agencies to address the barriers and challenges to employment of persons with disabilities. The CES&rsquo;s strategic priorities are to build skills, capacity and independence, to provide bridges and supports into work, to make work pay, to promote job retention and re-entry to work, to provide co-ordinated and seamless supports and to engage employers.</p>  <p>  Implementation of the Strategy is undertaken through agreed action plans and is monitored by an Implementation Group with an independent chairperson, Mr Fergus Finlay. Currently the group is monitoring the CES Phase Two Action Plan which covers the period 2019 &ndash; 2021. Development of a final Action Plan for the period 2022 &ndash; 2024 will soon take place. </p>  <p>  Each Department is responsible for delivering and implementing the actions assigned to it and for reporting on those the CES Implementation Group. Assessment of progress indicates that, while there are some key barriers that remain, progress is being made across government in implementing actions that do, or will improve the employment opportunities for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  My Department has a coordination function and provides secretariat to the Implementation Group. In addition, my Department has responsibility for a number of specific actions under the CES. Initiatives progressed by my Department under the current CES Action Plan include the funding and establishment of a disability information service for employers run by the Open Doors Initiative. This service &lsquo;Employers for Change: A Disability Information Service&rsquo; provides expert peer source of advice and information on employing staff with disabilities, with a view to enhancing the confidence and competence of individual employers to employ, manage and retain staff with disabilities. </p>  <p>  In addition, under the CES and as a commitment of the Programme for Government, my Department is responsible for implementing legislation that will double the target for employment of people with disabilities in the public service to 6%. This will be an important development. My Department is currently progressing this through the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, the General Scheme of which will shortly be submitted to Government for approval.   </p></reply>

One of the major building blocks of First 5 is  additional public funding, strategically invested, to achieve the best outcomes for babies, young children and their families. </p><p>Since 2015, state investment in ELC and SAC has increased by an unprecedented 141%. This funding has been used to remove barriers to access so that children can enrol and meaningfully participate in high-quality early learning and care and school-age childcare. <i>First 5</i>pledges to further increase investment in ELC and SAC by 2028 in order to make further progress towards average OECD levels of investment. </p><p>In 2021, the ELC/SAC budget allocation of &euro;638m for 2021, ensuring that 2020 funding levels are maintained. This allocation includes &euro;289.3m under the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme (ECCE), &euro;205.5m under the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and &euro;35m under the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM). This allocation incorporates, among many other funding streams, the full year costs of the additional hours of subsidised income-based childcare introduced in September 2020. Moreover, the allocation covers the 7% increase in AIM capitation rates introduced in January 2021, aligning the scheme with current ECCE capitation rates, which were increased by 7% in September 2018.</p><p><i>First 5</i>commits to at least doubling investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare between 2018 and 2028 and the new Funding Model will be a key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State.</p><p>An Expert Group was established in 2019 and tasked with the development of a new Funding Model to more precisely allocate public funding to deliver ELC/SAC services that align with national policy objectives, resourcing quality provision and delivering affordability for parents. The new Funding Model will ensure that the State leverages the maximum value from that investment. The intention is that the new Funding Model will operate in parallel with existing major funding programmes/schemes &ndash; the National Childcare Scheme and the universal pre-school Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE) which provide full or partial subsidies to parents. The new Funding Model will therefore be the framework for additional investment in services in return for clear evidence of quality and affordability to ensure effective use of public funding.</p><p>The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area. </p><p>The Expert Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in ELC and SAC systems, funding, quality, economics, and relevant policy experts from the Government Departments who will be involved in implementing the new funding model. </p><p>The Expert Group has met 17 times to date, most recently on 23 June. Stakeholder consultation is ongoing with the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum. It is expected that a report on the Group&rsquo;s recommendations will be submitted to me in November 2021 for consideration before submission to wider Government. </p><p>The work of the Expert Group is updated at a dedicated website &ndash; <i>www.first5fundingmodel.gov.ie</i>. The Agenda and Minutes of each meeting are published, as well as other information relating to the project. All research commissioned and carried out by Frontier Economics is also published here, along without outputs from Consultation and Engagement. </p><p>I am committed to the further development of career pathways for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare services. Establishing clear and supported career pathways is important both in improving recruitment and retention of staff, and in enhancing practitioners' continuing professional development, both of which support better outcomes for children.</p><p>Phase two of work on the Workforce Development Plan (WDP), which began in February 2021, involves the preparation of detailed policy proposals by a number of working groups, one of which is specifically looking at the career framework and career pathways. The final WDP report is expected to be published by the end of 2021.</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, a range of supports have been provided to the early learning and care and school-age childcare sector, including as the Deputy referenced, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). EWSS is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees under the auspices of the Department of Finance and administered by Revenue. </p><p>To qualify for the EWSS, as well as having tax clearance, employers must be able to show that their business experienced a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders over a defined period. However, Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare (ELC/SAC) employers registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Child Care Act 1991 are included in the EWSS with no turnover test.</p><p>The rate of subsidy employers receive per paid eligible employee under EWSS was revised on 20 October 2020 to a higher rate. As announced by the Minister for Finance on 1st June, these revised rates remain in place until end September 2021.  </p><p>For Q3, there are no changes for qualification for EWSS for the childcare sector.  The Government has approved the extension of the EWSS for Q4, however, it is considered too early yet to prescribe the precise operational parameters of the scheme that should apply for that quarter. An exit plan for EWSS will be announced in September 2021.</p><p>Work undertaken by my Department indicates that, further to the introduction of the revised rates, ELC/SAC services with EWSS are estimated to have approximately 80% of payroll costs covered. This equates to approximately 50% of the usual operating costs of these services.</p><p>The Programme for Government commits to supporting the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC) for the early learning and care and school-age childcare sector and the drawing up of an Employment Regulation Order. In December 2020, I began a short process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions in the sector and the suitability of a JLC. In agreement with IBEC/Childhood Services Ireland, and SIPTU, Dr Kevin Duffy, former Chair of the Labour Court, was appointed to be the independent chair of this process. </p><p>On foot of Dr Duffy&rsquo;s report, on 11 March I wrote to the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, recommending the establishment of a JLC for the sector. </p><p>The Labour Court published its Draft Establishment Order for a Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services on 27th April, for the purpose of public consultation. As part of this consultation process, the Labour Court held a public hearing on 28th May and on June 21st Minister English signed the Establishment Order for the JLC, which will take effect on July 1st. In line with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, it is now for the Labour Court and the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail to determine the membership of the Joint Labour Committee for the sector.</p><p>The establishment of the JLC will provide a key mechanism for unions and employer representatives to work together to determine wages and working conditions in the sector, thus helping employers to recruit and retain staff, and recognising the value of the work done by ELC and SAC practitioners.</p><p>My Department has begun a focused and thorough examination of its financial requirements ahead of Budget 2022. The allocation sought by my Department will be designed to meet the ongoing needs of the early learning and care and school-age childcare sector. It is anticipated that both the work of the Expert Group and Workforce Development Plan  will contribute to informing the Budget 2022 process.</p></reply>

The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, for families and for the wider society and economy.</p>  <p>  As the State does not employ early learning and childcare practitioners, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector.</p>  <p>  Based on figures available from Pobal Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2018/19, of approximately 26,000 staff working directly with children in mid-2019, it is estimated that 60% (or 15,600) were at that time paid below &euro;12.30 per hour and 40% (or 10,400) were paid &euro;12.30 or more.</p>  <p>  On this basis, it was estimated that the annual cost of raising the wages of all early learning and care and school-age childcare practitioners to at least &euro;12.30 per hour would in 2019 have been approximately &euro;30 million. The additional cost to employers for this in terms of employer PRSI and holiday pay would have been &euro;6m, bringing the total cost to &euro;36m.</p>  <p>  More recent data (from 2020) available from the Pobal Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2019/20 is still being analysed, and officials in my Department will revert directly to the Deputy with wage estimates for 2020 when the results of this analysis are available. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to supporting the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee (JLC) for the early learning and care and school-age childcare sector and the drawing up of an Employment Regulation Order. In December 2020, I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating the pay and conditions of employment of practitioners in early learning and care and school-age childcare, and to examine the suitability of establishing a JLC. </p>  <p>  The Labour Court published its Draft Establishment Order for a Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services on 27th April, for the purpose of public consultation. As part of this consultation process, the Labour Court held a public hearing on 28th May. On 21st June the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail signed the Establishment Order for the JLC, which will take effect on 1st July. </p></reply>

Services were required to provide Fire Safety Certificates as part of the re-registration process which was due to take place at the end of 2019.   Many services have already re-registered and submitted a Fire Safety Certificate and some have re-registered subject to submitting an up to date Fire Safety Certificate.</p>  <p>  In August 2019, Tusla issued guidance for registered providers of early years services on the fire and planning requirements for the re-registration process. It is important to note that these were not new regulations, but guidance on the submission of documentation for the purpose of re-registration. Registration of early years services is granted only where Tusla is satisfied that the premises, operation and location of the service poses no unmanaged risk to children. All registered services are expected to have the appropriate fire certification in place.</p>  <p>  In an effort to assist providers in meeting the re-registration deadline, Tusla divided the process into two parts. The first part, including submission of an application form and critical supporting documentation, was completed at the end of 2019 and the deadline for the second part (submission of remaining documents) postponed until June 2020. Due to the unprecedented situation with Covid&ndash;19, a decision was taken to further defer the deadline for submission of remaining supporting documentation to 1 November 2021. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the suitability and safety of premises is a key concern in the assessment of quality provision for children in early years services. Section 58G of the Child Care Act, 1991 (as amended by Part 12 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013) places an onus on the providers of early years services to ensure that they take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of children.  </p>  <p>  Given the absolute priority to keep children safe in these services and to assist services in meeting these regulations, I have allocated funding under my Department's Annual Capital Programme 2021 for services to complete any outstanding fire safety works needed to obtain a Fire Safety Certificate. A total of &euro;5 million has been allocated across 643 services to carry out remedial works to ensure these services will be fully compliant with fire safety standards as set out in Tulsa's registration requirements.</p></reply>

The data controller is obliged to inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of the receipt of the request including the reasons for the delay.

My Department is responding to SARs in accordance with its GDPR obligations and engages with each data subject in relation to the progress of their request. </p>  <p>  The right of a person to obtain a copy of their personal data, contained in Article 15 of the GDPR, is not absolute.

Therefore, in responding to a SAR, my Department must consider the rights of the data subject and also ensure that the rights and freedoms of others are not adversely affected. The consideration of adverse effects and the balancing of rights test is a critical part of the SAR process and can be highly complex. My Department also has regard to applicable Regulations such as S.I.  No. 82/89 &ndash; Data Protection (Access Modification) (Health) Regulations, 1989 where health data is included in a record. </p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General, developed guidelines which set out the steps that must be taken in response to each subject access request. </p>  <p>  In order to assist the processing of subject access requests and to vindicate the rights of data subjects, my Department has put in place a multi-disciplinary team which includes legal and data protection expertise. In addition, my Department has engaged external data protection consultants to support the processing of SARs.  </p>  <p>  Information relevant to making a SAR is available on my Department's website. The webpage also includes a detailed guide to making a SAR that provides responses to Frequently Asked Questions. The guide includes information on the different means available to make a SAR such as by email, post or other means.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department also operates a dedicated telephone information line which provides information to callers on procedures for making a SAR in respect of records relating to the Mother and Baby Home Commission of Investigation.  </p></reply>

Allied to that objective, <i>First 5</i>identifies as a key building block additional public funding, strategically invested, to achieve the best outcomes for babies, young children and their families. <i>First 5</i>commits to at least doubling investment in ELC and SAC between 2018 and 2028 and a new Funding Model will be a key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State. </p><p>An Expert Group has been convened by my Department to develop a new Funding Model for Early Learning and Childcare. The Expert Group is tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can be delivered for the sector to achieve these objectives, drawing on international practice in this area.  </p><p>The Expert Group have met seventeen times to date, most recently on 23 June, and a report on their recommendations is expected to be submitted to me in November 2021 for consideration. Included in the scope of the Group's Terms of Reference are implementation considerations, including the appropriate timing and phasing of the approach, ensuring the sustainability of the sector, accountability for public funding, and the technical and operational feasibility of the new funding model.</p><p>Implementation of the Group's recommendations will be dependent on budgetary decisions, and funding is likely to become available on an incremental basis. The full implementation of the Expert Group's recommendations is therefore likely to be a multi-annual process. In the short term, I anticipate that the Group&rsquo;s recommendations will contribute to informing the Budget 2022 process and my officials are already engaged in that process. </p><p>The Programme for Government commits to implementing <i>First 5</i>, including the planned increase in investment over a number of years, and the new funding model will enable that increased investment to deliver the types of services that align with national policy objectives, resourcing quality provision and requiring affordability for participation in the new model.</p><p>Further detail on the work of the Expert Group and documentation related to the process is available at first5fundingmodel.gov.ie/</p></reply>

Providers can use this funding either to reduce the child-to-adult ratio in the pre-school room or to fund an extra staff member. This staff member is a shared resource with other children in the pre-school room. The Early Years Services Regulations (S.I. No. 221/2016) require that all staff who are employed by an early learning and care provider and who work directly with children of pre-school age must hold, at a minimum, a major award at level 5 on the NFQ in Early Childhood Care and Education or a qualification deemed equivalent by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. </p>  <p>  The December 2016 amendment to the Regulations (S.I. No. 632/2016) provided for exceptional cases in which an exemption from the Level 5 requirement may be made for children with specific needs in the context of AIM. An example of a relevant situation is where a child with complex healthcare needs requires specialised health supports, such as nursing, in order to attend the pre-school. </p>  <p>  Tusla, the independent statutory regulator of pre-school services, has published a Quality and Regulatory Framework (QRF), which specifies how the Regulations will be interpreted by the Early Years Inspectorate. The QRF (section 2, paragraph 6) specifies that exemption under AIM from the qualification requirement requires an exemption letter from Pobal.</p>  <p>  This requirement for an exemption letter from Pobal is also specified in the Funding Agreement for the ECCE pre-school programme, which states, with reference to the Level 5 minimum qualification requirement, that "In exceptional cases, an exemption may be made under AIM, wherein a child with medically complex needs who is availing of AIM Level 7 requires specialised health supports, for example healthcare assistant or nursing care. An exemption may be granted by Pobal where it is considered that such specialist support is required and this may detail the qualification requirements or relevant specialist training of the staff member involved." </p>  <p>  As these cases are exceptional, the majority of Access and Inclusion Model support workers are still required to hold at least a major award in Early Childhood Care and Education at Level 5 on the National Qualifications Framework, as set out in S.I. No. 221/2016.</p></reply>

This process is essentially a full cost model where each programme initially receives a set amount of funding commensurate to the estimated costs of delivery. Ultimately, the funding provided corresponds to the full costs of delivery. The proposed alternative funding model, which is being considered for all FET provision, seeks to align available funding directly with learner activity by apportioning it with regard to the previous year&rsquo;s completion returns. In this respect, it is important to emphasise that this would not be a Youthreach funding model but rather a FET funding model. The envisaged benefits of such an approach include increases in transparency, efficiency and value for money.</p>  <p>  It is also important to highlight that it is currently envisaged that, for the purposes of the model, a completer will be defined as a learner who completes 25% or more of the course. It would not be the case, under the proposed model, that centres would lose funding where a learner or learners do not complete the full course. </p>  <p>  The exact details on the type of provision which will be categorised within each of the components of the funding model is still to be decided. The independent panel, charged with making recommendations in relation to the proposed model, are however very conscious of the unique characteristics of Youthreach provision and Youthreach learners, and are committed to ensuring that the future funding approach recognises the significant costs incurred in delivery of the programme. </p></reply>

Section 29 of the 2018 Act provides for the application jointly by two or more applicant institutes to the Minister of Education and Skills for an order seeking designation as a TU subject to their jointly meeting specified eligibility criteria.  Section 38 of the 2018 Act provides that an applicant institute and an established technological university may apply to the Minister for an order. </p><p>Government has assisted a number of IoT consortia to develop proposals for TU designation in terms both of providing financial assistance and, as appropriate, calling on the expert advice of the Higher Education Authority (HEA) in the framing and developing of relevant TU oriented proposals.</p><p>Since 2013 some &euro;120 million in Exchequer co-funding will have been allocated to such consortia and emerging TUs, of which &euro;90 million is ring-fenced under a TU Transformation Fund with the first tranche of &euro;34.33 m in allocations being made last October.</p><p>Under the 2020 Transformation Fund IADT Dun Laoghaire was allocated &euro;100,000 to explore how it might pursue a trajectory to achieve TU designation in accordance with the provision of the 2018 Act. Further details  of the allocation are attached in Appendix 1.</p><p>Dundalk Institute of Technology is in a similar position to that of IADT and that institution, too, is being assisted by the HEA under the Transformation Fund to explore how TU designation can be achieved.</p><p>The administration of the Transformation Fund is a matter for the HEA with annual allocations and planned activities in the period to 2023  being overseen by the Authority.</p><p>It is a matter for the governing body of a Higher Education Institution such as IADT Dun Laoghaire to decide on the strategic direction and positioning of the institution within the higher education landscape and to pursue a relevant direction of travel accordingly, including for TU designation as appropriate. </p><p>My Department understands that IADT Dun Laoghaire is in discussions with the HEA in relation to 2021 allocations and proposals under the Transformation Fund. </p><p>  ">Appendix</p></reply>

However, the e-mail service remained available throughout this period.

Just over 79,000 applicants were assessed as eligible for grant support with projected total costs of &euro;370 million. Applications for the 2021/2022 academic year are open and to date, we have received over 69,000 applications.  Over 41,500 have been approved for grant support.</p>  <p>   In relation to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, PUP has been treated as reckonable income since it was introduced in March 2020. Income from the Covid-19 payment has the same standing and is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseekers Allowance. It is important there is a consistency of approach for all students. A student or a family on Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance must be treated the same as a student or a family on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.</p>  <p>  This is not the first year the scheme has dealt with claims related to the pandemic. Over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in 2020/21 and some 40% of these related to COVID-19. The scheme has shown a flexibility in addressing these issues.</p>  <p>  For the next academic year (2021/22), an application will ordinarily be assessed on gross income from all sources for the period January to December 2020. However, if an applicant or a family member has experienced a change in circumstances during 2021, then they can apply to SUSI for their application to be assessed or reassessed under a change in circumstances.  Such a change in circumstances would include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment.  The change in circumstance must be likely to continue for the duration of the course or the foreseeable future. This is a well-established procedure. </p>  <p>  SUSI has a data sharing agreement with the Department of Social Protection which enables SUSI to check what type of payments grant applicants are in receipt of.</p>  <p>  My Department is expecting an increase in the number of applications as a result of Covid and we secured an additional &euro;20 million in Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  The number of applications to SUSI, the approved awards, number of appeals and the change of circumstances cases are all carefully monitored on a weekly basis to monitor spend, predict costs and identify trends.  </p>  <p>   We will continue to monitor this and work with colleagues across Government to ensure the scheme can be fair and responsive to the individual circumstances of applicants.</p></reply>

This strategy includes a commitment to develop the work of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) to include targeted work with 'harder-to-reach' young people. This includes young people heavily involved in crime and anti-social behaviour, for whom there are little supports and interventions available in practice, unless they are before the courts, in which case they may be under the supervision of the Probation Service. The strategy also prioritises early intervention work, including with younger children who are assessed as being at serious risk. Both of these cohorts may include children at risk of recruitment by crime gangs.</p>  <p>  The development of this work within the GYDP network will be supported by the Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice (REPPP) project at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL).  The REPPP project has led on the production of the &ldquo;Greentown Report&rdquo;, which studied the influence of criminal networks on children in Ireland, and was published in December 2016. The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership between UL and the Department of Justice. </p>  <p>  The Greentown Report identifies crime networks as a separate and plausible risk factor underlying criminal offending by certain children. It outlines how the influence of criminal networks increases the level of offending by a small number of children and entraps them in offending situations.  </p>  <p>  The Greentown Report recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks. The REPPP project team implemented a bespoke process to produce a model for an Irish evidence-informed intervention programme. This new &ldquo;Greentown Programme&rdquo; has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. The programme is managed jointly between my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the University of Limerick.</p>  <p>  Pilot applications of the Greentown programme, developed by the REPPP project, commenced in two locations in 2020 and will run for three years. The learning from these pilots will then be incorporated into mainstream GYDP practice. This specially designed intervention programme was developed with international expert advice, to tackle coercive control of children by criminal groups which entraps them in offending situations. Funds are already available for the initial pilots from the Dormant Accounts Funds, with a total of &euro;4.2m allocated over three years.  </p>  <p>  The implementation of the Greentown pilot programme is part of the strategic objectives of the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027. This implementation process began with the establishment of the Governance and Strategy Group, and the Youth Justice Oversight Group. Both groups are chaired by the Department of Justice, which will provide oversight arrangements for youth justice Initiatives, including the Greentown pilots, to ensure that there is a cohesive response in practice to the needs of particular cohorts of children and particular communities.</p>  <p>  With regard to the contact details requested by the Deputy, I will write to him separately with these, and I will be happy to arrange a discussion with my officials for the Deputy if he wishes. </p></reply>

As Minister, I play no role in these independent functions. </p>  <p>  The Commissioner is also responsible for the distribution and stationing of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the State. I am advised, however, that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in light of identified operational needs.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Dublin city centre is composed of two Garda Divisions, the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) North Central (NC) and DMR South Central (SC). As of the end of May 2021, the latest date for when figures are available, DMR NC has 662 members of all ranks assigned, whilst DMR SC has a strength of 715 members of all ranks. These are increases of 12% and 14% respectively since the end of 2015. </p>  <p>  For the Deputy's information, the Garda Commissioner established Operation Soteria to ensure a reduction of assaults in public, reduce fear of assault within communities, prioritise assault investigations, and focus on problem areas and assault hotspots. The Operation includes targeting knife crimes in areas where it is shown to be relevant and necessary. </p>  <p>  The operation is based upon five principles for implementation: commitment to protecting people and communities; awareness and education as a crime prevention technique; policing operational efficiency; location management by working in partnership; and offender management.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be also be aware that my Department has published the general scheme of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. The Bill will provide for a key principle from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland that preventing crime and harm and making our communities safer does not rest with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department alone.  </p>  <p>  It will be best achieved as a 'whole of government' responsibility, with Departments and agencies responsible for health and social services, education authorities and local authorities, the Garda&iacute; and the wider community working together.</p>  <p>  The new Bill will achieve this by establishing innovative Local Community Safety Partnerships to develop local safety plans tailored to the priorities and needs identified by communities themselves. The Local Community Safety Partnerships will replace and build upon the existing joint policing committees and will provide a forum for State agencies and local community representatives to work together to act on community concerns. </p>  <p>  Each Partnership will devise and oversee a Local Community Safety Plan, which will be informed by the community itself. Membership of the Partnerships will include, but not be limited to: residents; community representatives (including youth, new communities and voluntary sector); business and education representatives; relevant public services including the HSE, Tusla, Garda&iacute; and the local authority; and local councillors. Each Partnership will have an independent chair.</p>  <p>  The new Local Community Safety Partnerships will run initially on a pilot basis in the Dublin North Inner City, Waterford and Longford for a period of two years, after which they will inform a nationwide rollout of the model to every local authority area. </p>  <p>  The new Youth Justice Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2027 was also published on 15 April last. The Strategy includes the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, including early intervention and preventative work, family support and diversion from crime, through to court process and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration, and support post release. </p>  <p>  The Strategy strengthens and expands the role of the Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) and promotes appropriate linkages and alignment with other community-based initiatives, including those supported by the Probation Service.  Bringing the full range of relevant interventions together in a coherent and holistic response to youth crime will support the objective of diverting young people from crime and anti-social behaviour. </p>  <p>  There are currently 105 GYDPs nationally and the intention is to further develop this service so that it is available to every child in the State who could benefit from it, through an ongoing expansion of existing services and the foundation of new projects where necessary.</p>  <p>  The Strategy also provides that, where necessary, GYDPs can provide a broader range of services, including family support and engagement with children aged 8-12 years, as well as developing enhanced approaches to engaging with harder to reach children and young people who may have more entrenched patterns of offending.</p>  <p>  The Youth Justice Strategy provides a framework to:</p>  <p>  - prevent offending behaviour occurring;</p>  <p>  - divert children and young adults who commit a crime away from further offending and involvement with the criminal justice system; and</p>  <p>  - enhance criminal justice processes, detention and post-detention measures, to provide consistent support to encourage desistance from crime and promote positive personal development for young offenders.</p></reply>

The coroner is an independent quasi-judicial office holder whose core function is to investigate sudden and unexplained deaths so that a death certificate can be issued. This is an important public service to the living and in particular to the next-of-kin and friends of the deceased. Coroners not only provide closure for those bereaved, but also perform a wider public service by identifying matters of public health and safety concerns.</p>  <p>  The report from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) - Death Investigation, Coroners' Inquests and the Rights of the Bereaved - was published on 21 April last. The ICCL noted, on its publication, that it had not consulted with my Department prior to its publication. </p>  <p>  On 11 May 2021, senior officials of my Department met with the ICCL and the report's authors who outlined the development of the report and the various issues concerned. My Department will now proceed to examine the report and its recommendations in detail, as indicated to the ICCL. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to actively consider the optimum organisation of the coroner service.  It has taken responsibility for the Dublin Coroner Office from the local authorities since 1 January 2018. We have greatly increased the resources available to that Office in the intervening period. The related mortuary and post-mortem examination facilities, which are also available to the Office of State Pathologist have also been improved and extra resources provided.</p></reply>

Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in its functions. However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has provided me with the following update on the Probate Office and the statistics requested by the Deputy in the table.  </p><p>Average waiting times below are subject to there being no queries raised on the papers submitted. <table>    <tr>       <th>Office</th>       <th>Average waiting/case closure time for solicitor applicants (weeks)</th>       <th>Average waiting time for personal applicants (weeks)</th>       <th>Active/open cases as of 23/6/21 (days)</th>       <th>Full-time and part-time staff</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>55</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>406</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>5 months</td>       <td>3089</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>1.63</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>173</td>       <td>2 part-time</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>4-8</td>       <td>4-8</td>       <td>117</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>150</td>       <td>1.6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>128</td>       <td>2 part-time</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>94</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>1 part-time</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>4-6</td>       <td>3-5</td>       <td>130</td>       <td>2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>1.3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>6-8</td>       <td>8-10</td>       <td>46</td>       <td>2 part-time</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>58</td>       <td>0.75</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>County Registrars are responsible for the management of probate in District Probate Registries outside of Dublin and are independent in carrying out their functions. The Courts Service works closely with County Registrars to support their timely processing of applications. </p><p>There have been variations in the level of service that could be provided as a result of Covid-19 restrictions, however I am assured that District Probate Registries continued to work at all times during the pandemic.  The scheduling of personal application interviews must be conducted in line with public health guidelines. As a result, the Courts Service advises that personal applications did have to be curtailed during Level 5 restrictions to ensure the safety of both the applicant and staff. </p><p>The Courts Service has confirmed that interviews for personal applications resumed in May and additional staff resources have been allocated in some locations to facilitate these interviews. </p><p>Again, District Registries normally are small offices and I understand from the Courts Service that staff turnover can lead to temporary spikes in waiting times while vacancies are filled. However, the staff of the Probate Office are committed to clearing any backlogs while the Courts Service is committed to continuing to resource this work to minimise waiting times as far as possible.</p><p>The Courts Service also advises that the manual Revenue affidavit was removed from the probate process and replaced with an online system, which went live last September.  I can also confirm that the e-probate project remains on the Courts Service's list of modernisation projects. I am advised that the timetable for its implementation has yet to be determined and that it will continue to be considered in the context of other priority projects in the areas of civil, criminal and family law.</p></reply>

The EDI Strategy will be central to my Department's mission of working for a safe, fair, inclusive Ireland and to fulfilling our public sector duty obligations.  This work is being progressed by the Department's Equality, Diversity Inclusion and Public Sector Duty Committee. </p><p>The draft objectives of this strategy will focus on: </p><p>- improving the accessibility and quality of our services</p><p>- supporting the development of a skilled and diverse workforce</p><p>- building and embedding a workplace culture which facilitates, supports and encourages contributions from all</p><p>In accordance with our public sector duty, from 2019 onwards, all governance agreements made by the Department outline the obligation for all public bodies (i.e. the agencies) to include the Public Sector Duty in their strategic planning process and report on a regular basis on their progress. This action is a significant milestone in embedding the public sector duty obligations in the Department's governance framework. </p><p>The Department has also included a requirement in all grant agreements that Grantees are obliged to have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality and protect the human rights of staff and persons to whom services are provided.</p><p>In addition, my Department has identified a number actions in its Justice Plan for 2021 including: </p><p>- Lead on implementation of the diversity measures identified under Action 16</p><p>- Support and monitoring diversity initiatives as core part of governance of agencies </p><p>Progress in relation to these actions will be reported and published at the end of 2021.  </p></reply>

I am aware that Garda&iacute; have highlighted scams of late where people have pretended to be from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Social Protection, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, banks, delivery companies, businesses and even in recent weeks, the Department of Justice. </p><p>I am informed that work is ongoing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle this issue. This includes, but is not limited to the issuing of advisory notices to members of the public warning against this criminal tactic and advising how to proceed should they be targeted.</p><p>I am further informed that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) proactively engages with telecommunications providers to suspend VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) numbers, which are suspected of being used to commit fraud.  </p><p>I am advised that this engagement does not involve the invoking of any legal power and it is the experience of GNECB that telecommunications companies based in Ireland will provide assistance in the suspension of such numbers, upon notification that a VOIP number or other number is being used to commit fraud offences. </p><p>In addition, the use of &lsquo;spoofed numbers&rsquo; involves a process wherein a suspected caller/fraudster uses technology to disguise their number from the recipient of the call, by changing their caller ID.  In such cases a suspected fraudster calling from abroad, for example, will set the caller ID to look like an Irish number (landline, mobile) to lull the recipient into a false sense of security.  Telecommunications companies have informed the GNECB that they have no control over the use of &lsquo;spoofed numbers&rsquo; and it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to identify the source of these calls. </p></reply>

The Eating Disorders Model of Care was launched in 2018 and was developed in partnership with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and BodyWhys, the national support group for people with eating disorders.</p><p>&euro;1.77 million has been invested to date in eating disorder specialist posts, with 21.8 WTEs now in place. In addition, I secured the balance of 3.94M for 2021 and this will enable further investment in specialist posts throughout this year. More specifically, it will allow for the establishment of three new specialist eating disorder teams and the completion of the three existing specialist teams.  Premises are already under development for the new community team at the Mount Carmel site, and is expected to be completed by the end 2021. Recruitment is progressing well for all teams.</p><p>The funding allocated to date has seen significant growth and improvement in our services. Despite the significant increase in referrals in 2020, there was a 43% increase in the number of eating disorder assessments completed, compared to 2019, with twice as many people starting treatment.</p><p>As of last year, there are three specialist eating disorder teams in place. This means that we can treat over 90% of people with eating disorders in the community, avoiding more serious inpatient treatment.</p><p>Specialist outpatient treatment has been found to be the most effective and fastest way for most people with eating disorders to recover. Although there is good evidence that inpatient psychiatric care is not required for most people with eating disorders, it is recognised that a small number of people, mainly with restrictive eating disorders, require inpatient care for short periods, for structured refeeding and/or stabilisation.</p><p>In circumstances where in-patient care is required, children and adolescents care is provided in one of the 4 Regional CAMHS Units across the country. Linn Dara (8) and Merlin Park (6) have dedicated a number of specialist eating disorder beds, and while there are no dedicated beds in the remaining two CAMHS units, all beds are available to eating disorder admissions. A further 8 beds are planned for an Eating Disorder Unit in the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital. </p><p>For adults, people who require in-patient care are admitted to local general adult approved centres and attend generic inpatient treatment programmes. CHO6 has 3 dedicated beds for eating disorders based in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital. The number of adult beds will increase, in line with the National Clinical Programme, including an additional 3 beds in St. Vincent's, 5 beds in north Dublin, 5 beds in Galway and 5 beds in Cork. Timeframes for new beds will have to be identified. These beds will be linked to eating disorder hubs. The funding available for 2021 will allow for the creation of two new adult eating disorder hubs in CHO4 and CHO9.</p><p>Importantly, with the right support and intervention, people can and do recover from eating disorders. The Government and the Department, along with the HSE and its partners, are committed to providing and expanding high-quality treatment and support for all those affected by eating disorders.</p></reply>

The combination of supports in the location, outreach supports, and remote supports provides an overall quantum of support to service users of over 60% at the end of January. The increase in day service capacity was supported by additional funding of &euro;30 million provided in Budget 2021 to increase capacity in buildings and provide extra staff. This funding provided an increase in day services by an average of one day a week for 14,940 people against September 2020 service levels.</p>  <p>  For the duration of the COVID-19 emergency day service capacity is reduced, this is due to the physical limitations of the buildings available, the lack of mainstream community activities, and the continued restrictions imposed by social distancing guidance. Many people with disabilities have underlying health conditions, and as the threat of COVID-19 remains, unfortunately so too does the need for these restrictions.</p>  <p>  The vaccination process for staff and service users is well underway across day services, and all service providers should now be delivering a minimum of 60% of pre-COVID levels of location-based supports. For those in residential services, currently their day service supports are largely being provided in their residence, however some service users have returned to their day service location, and it is now expected that all residential service users that received their day service at a location pre-COVID should begin to resume location-based day service supports.</p>  <p>  The HSE is in the process of establishing the vaccination status of all staff and service users in day services. Once established, the HSE will engage with Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) on what further easing of restrictions can appropriately be applied to day services. Those attending day services have been vaccinated as part of cohort 4, people aged 16-69 years and at very high risk of severe COVID-19 disease. The administration of the second vaccine dose for this cohort began in the week beginning May 10th and is expected to be complete by early July.</p>  <p>  The IPC guidance are kept under constant review and updates will be provided in the months ahead on further restoration of day services.</p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.  On 28 May, Government decided to move ahead with the process of lifting restrictions further and a range of measures were eased in June. </p>  <p>  I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science that further and higher education institutions and providers are enabling provision during the summer period. This is to be managed in line with the current discretionary framework for the sector and prevailing public health advice. In accordance with public health advice, appropriate protective measures will be in place and numbers on site will be controlled. This will provide an experiential basis for institutions and providers in organising and managing the safe return of students and learners on-site in the autumn through initially modest and manageable levels of provision.</p>  <p>  While there has been scope to continue with the easing of public health measures, our approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensure that our progress in controlling the virus is maintained. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. To protect the gains of recent months we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours and to follow public health guidelines.</p></reply>

The reorganisation of care was reflected in the national cardiovascular strategy in 2010 which proposed the centralisation of cardiovascular services in order to maximise access, expertise and population coverage which formed part of the consideration of the current National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. </p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018 with Professor Phillip Nolan as Chair of the Steering Group. This Review aims to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. This aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.</p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made on the Review, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted on the progress of the review, as the Chair has played a key role in the national COVID-19 response, both as a member of the NPHET and Chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group.

All applicable travellers must reserve and pay for a place in mandatory hotel quarantine.</p>  <p>  The Act identifies those who are exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine, and a full list of exemptions can be accessed on www.gov.ie/quarantine.  </p>  <p>  With effect from 8th May, if a person has travelled abroad for unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive medical reasons they will not be required to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine on their return to Ireland.  They will be required to present a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner or from a person holding an equivalent qualification outside the State to the effect that they had an unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive reason for so travelling. In addition, any carer or dependent travelling with this person will also be exempted from the requirement to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine.</p>  <p>  A person whose medical situation is not deemed to be unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive or who does not have appropriate medical certification is not exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine. For a person to qualify for this exemption, the medical reason for travel to the State must be all of the following:</p>  <p>  - unavoidable: that is, not elective</p>  <p>  - imperative: that is, urgent and essential</p>  <p>  - time sensitive: that is, the medical condition or medical need which is the reason for travel is such that a delay in treatment would cause irreparable or very significant harm</p>  <p>  A registered medical practitioner or person with equivalent qualifications outside the State must assess and certify the medical reasons claimed. Practitioners should bear in mind that all three conditions must be met &ndash; the reason must be unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive. Not all medical needs or treatments will meet these conditions, so it is important to consult your doctor before travelling to confirm that he or she will be able to provide the appropriate certification.</p>  <p>  A person whose medical situation does not meet this test or who does not have appropriate medical certification is not exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine. Travellers wishing to avail of this exemption must note that both elements must be satisfied &ndash; they must have medical certification and must also be able to satisfy border control staff that their treatment was &lsquo;unavoidable, imperative and time-sensitive&rsquo;; cosmetic procedures, for example, are very unlikely to meet this standard. However, they can still, after entering mandatory hotel quarantine, request a review of their quarantine on grounds of their medical needs. Further information on the review (appeals) procedure is set out below.</p>  <p>  As of 17th April, passengers who are 'fully vaccinated' and have the documents to confirm this are no longer required to complete mandatory hotel quarantine on arrival in Ireland. Dependents, including children, will also be exempted from the requirement to complete mandatory hotel quarantine in this instance. Please note that the 4 EMA approved vaccines currently accepted have specific definitions for when a person would be considered 'fully vaccinated'.</p>  <p>  Passengers who are fully vaccinated and exempt from hotel quarantine are still subject to other travel restrictions, such as the need to provide a negative pre-departure PCR test and complete a period of self-quarantine at home or wherever specified in their passenger locator form.</p>  <p>  Determinations of medical exemptions are made on arrival in to the State. In this regard, my Department does not hold information in relation to the number of people who travelled abroad and were exempt from Mandatory Hotel Quarantine as a result of gastric sleeve surgery.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the list of designated states will be subject to change at short notice and passengers are required to check the list before travelling to Ireland, to be sure of their obligations.</p>  <p>  Neither I as Minister for Health nor my Department have any role in decisions relating to whether individual persons must enter mandatory quarantine or whether individual persons are exempted travellers. All such decisions are to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.   </p>  <p>  On 28 May, Government decided to move ahead with the process of lifting restrictions further. A range of measures were eased in June, and it has signaled a further easing of measures in July and August subject to the epidemiological situation at the time.  </p>  <p>  I can confirm to the Deputy that solo dancing instruction is included as activity under individual training and restarted on the 7 June. </p>  <p>  While there has been scope to continue with the easing of public health measures, our approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensure that our progress in controlling the virus is maintained. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. To protect the gains of recent months we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours and to follow public health guidelines.  </p></reply>

In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p><p>Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).</p><p>The HSE has advised that it received an application in December 2018 for the reimbursement of Patisiran (Onpattro) for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy.</p><p>In January 2019, a full health technology assessment (HTA) with respect to this indication was commissioned by the HSE. This assessment was completed in February 2020, with the NCPE recommending that Patisiran not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p><p>The HTA report with respect to Patisiran was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group in July 2020, along with the outputs of commercial discussions with the applicant which took place in May 2020, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process.</p><p>The HSE Drugs Group requested patient and clinician input via the Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) to assist the group in making its recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) regarding reimbursement of Patisiran.</p><p>The RDTRC convened on 24 September and reviewed the clinical data previously submitted as part of the established pricing and reimbursement process. The Committee also heard from Consultants involved in the specialist management of patients with hATTR amyloidosis.</p><p>The RDTRC continued its review of Patisiran at its subsequent meeting on 5 November which included patient input on the impact of hATTR amyloidosis. Following these meetings, the Committee finalised a statement summarising the clinician and patient engagement on Patisiran which was received by the HSE Drugs Group on 26 November.</p><p>The HSE has advised that it met with the applicant company in December 2020 and in early January 2021 for further discussions and deliberations on the pricing position. At its January 2021 meeting, the HSE Drugs Group reviewed all the relevant documentation concerning the application, including information provided by the RDTRC. The HSE has advised that, having considered all of the criteria of which is obliged to take account, the HSE Drugs Group was unable to recommend in favour of reimbursement.</p><p>The decision-making authority in the HSE is the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT). The HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed that it issued notice to the applicant company of the proposed decision of the EMT not to support reimbursement of Patisiran in February 2021.</p><p>Where the HSE EMT team has considered a recommendation of non-reimbursement from the HSE Drugs Group and proposes to accept such a recommendation, the HSE is legally required (in line with the 2013 Health Act) to set out in detail a notice of any proposed decision to an applicant company. The HSE is also legally required in such circumstances to provide at least a 28-day period (from the formal written notice of proposal) to enable an applicant company to consider the proposal not to reimburse and to make representations to the HSE. The HSE is legally required to consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.</p><p>The HSE advises that the applicant company submitted representations on 5 March and 12 March, in response to the EMT&rsquo;s proposed decision. These were considered at the HSE Drugs Group's May 2021 meeting, with a view to making a recommendation to the HSE EMT on the basis of all of the available evidence, in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p><p>The application for the reimbursement of Patisiran remains under consideration with the HSE. As decision-making authority, the HSE EMT will, following receipt of the outcome of the HSE Drugs Group's deliberations, make a decision on whether Patisiran will be reimbursed.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-06-29a.1274.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021062900080#WRX02775"><p>The Delta (B1.617.2) variant of COVID-19 was designated a Variant of Concern (VOC) in Ireland on Monday 12th May 2021. As of 24 June 2021, 210 cases of the Delta variant have been confirmed in Ireland by Whole Genome Sequencing. As per the Health Protection Surveillance Centre&rsquo;s (HPSC) latest variant report with data to week 23 2021, in terms of most likely source of transmission of Delta cases, 56 were travel-related, 108 were close contacts of cases, 2 were healthcare-setting acquired, 33 were community transmission, and 11 were under investigation. The majority of these cases (162/210, 77%) were located in Dublin. The mean age of cases identified as infected with this variant was 31 years and the median age was 30 years (range: 0-78 years). </p>  <p>  The evidence available to date indicates that the Delta variant, which is now the dominant variant across the United Kingdom (UK), is likely to be more transmissible and less susceptible to current vaccines. All analyses have found that it has a very substantial growth advantage. Monitoring in England and Scotland indicates a reduction in vaccine effectiveness with this being more pronounced after one dose (absolute reduction of 15-20%). In the UK, increasing COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths are also being observed in the context of rising prevalence of the Delta variant. This is of immediate concern here given the high numbers of people not yet vaccinated and, particularly, the high numbers of people of older age groups awaiting their second dose. This poses a significant risk to the pandemic response in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Enhanced control measures have been implemented for all identified cases of the Delta variant in Ireland in order to mitigate the risk of further spread. All suspected cases of this variant are managed as per enhanced public health investigation and control for Variants of Concern by public health teams in the HSE. </p>  <p>  All passengers arriving in Ireland must complete a COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form and provide evidence of a negative or &lsquo;not detected&rsquo; result from a COVID-19 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test carried out no more than 72 hours before arrival into Ireland. Those travelling from or via a designated State must pre-book and pre-pay for a place in a designated facility for mandatory hotel quarantine. For all others who are not otherwise exempt, mandatory home quarantine requirements apply. Full details are set out on www.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  The increasing prevalence of the Delta variant in certain areas of England and detection in all geographical regions of the UK, poses an additional risk of importation due to close travel connections between the UK and Ireland. Those who arrive into Ireland from non-designated countries, including Great Britain, must observe 14 days of home quarantine.  This 14-day period of home quarantine can be shortened for those who receive a not-detected RT-PCR test result 5 days after arrival. Furthermore, those who travel from Great Britain, who are not fully vaccinated are now requested to remain in quarantine and seek a further test at least 10 days after arrival in Ireland, in addition to the day 5 test. Further messaging to all incoming travellers, particularly from Great Britain, has been put in place to emphasise the home quarantine requirement and to encourage uptake of the 5-day post arrival test.  The Government continues to advise against all non-essential international travel, including from Great Britain.</p>  <p>  Evidence in relation to the Delta variant and its potential implications for the pandemic response in Ireland continue to be kept under close review.</p></reply>

We do however know that the clinical course of viral illnesses varies between people, and that the virus that causes Covid-19 can be detected in some people for many weeks. However, this does not mean that people are infectious for a prolonged period of time.</p>  <p>  Fatigue is a common symptom after many viral infections and while most people recover in a short few days or weeks it can be prolonged and more severe for others. The reason for this is unclear. We would usually expect people to make a full recovery over time. Covid-19 is a multisystem infection and may impact people in differing ways.</p>  <p>  Specific guidance on what has been referred to as the &ldquo;long-tail&rdquo; is presently under development both here and internationally.  Longer-term observational studies will be required to understand the health consequences presently being attributed to post Covid-19 infection.</p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that the HSE as part of its work on post-Covid, is now looking at how it can model the possible numbers that will be affected, noting that this will take time as more evidence emerges. There is a lot of uncertainty in the international literature about how many people experience prolonged symptoms so it is extremely difficult to determine the scale as yet in Ireland, however the HSE are monitoring the situation very closely and looking at how we can best estimate the scale, this will take some time and will need continual review.</p>  <p>  I understand that the HSE has been in touch with and will be engaging with a group of people who are suffering post-Covid symptoms. Guidance is being developed to align needs with care provision and to develop criteria and strategies for the ongoing evaluation of patients.</p>  <p>  People who have had Covid-19 are being followed up by their GP or in hospital settings. People in the community who are concerned about persistent Covid-19 symptoms should contact their GP. People who were admitted to hospital with Covid -19 are usually seen by the clinical team who admitted them so care is provided across a variety of clinics and settings. Treatment is currently focused on management of specific symptoms.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made on the capital project, with planning permission for the hospital secured in 2017 and, in 2018, the awarding of contract for substantial enabling works. </p>  <p>  The ownership and governance arrangements are more complex. The proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new NMH at Elm Park were set out in the Mulvey Agreement, which was finalised in 2016 following an extensive mediation process between the NMH and the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, published thereafter and noted by Government in 2017. The Mulvey Agreement provides for the establishment of a new company - National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC - which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary, independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.</p>  <p>  The draft legal framework subsequently developed is designed to copperfasten these arrangements. It provides that the new hospital remains in State ownership and that thus, the State&rsquo;s significant investment will be protected.  The clear legal advice provided to the State is that the draft legal framework ensures that all legally permissible medical services will be provided in the new hospital. </p>  <p>  I have been very clear that I will not bring anything to Government unless it provides assurances around all legally permissible services being provided in the new NMH. In addition, the safeguarding of the State&rsquo;s investment must also be put beyond doubt.</p>  <p>  In that context, as I have recently stated, I intend to engage further with both St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and the Religious Sisters of Charity, as we move toward the finalisation of the arrangements.</p></reply>

The reorganisation of care was reflected in the national cardiovascular strategy in 2010 which proposed the centralisation of cardiovascular services in order to maximise access, expertise and population coverage which formed part of the consideration of the current National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services. </p>  <p>  The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018 with Professor Phillip Nolan as Chair of the Steering Group. This Review aims to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. This aligns with the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.</p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made on the Review, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted on the progress of the review, as the Chair has played a key role in the national COVID-19 response, both as a member of the NPHET and Chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group.

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020. </p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. </p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.). The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness.</p><p>Further details are available here:<i>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/93f8f-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-irelands-vaccination-prioritisation-list/</i>.</p></reply>

In order to protect women, babies, staff and our maternity service as a whole, it has been necessary to introduce restrictions on attendance at maternity services. This has unfortunately included limitations on access of partners to maternity wards, theatres and appointments.  My Department and the HSE have been engaging closely in relation to this matter.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that in mid-May a review of compliance was conducted in all maternity hospitals/units, based on the HSE-AMRIC national guidance in place. At that time, the HSE confirmed that 14 of the 19 maternity hospitals/units were fully compliant with the guidance.  As of last week, the HSE has advised that all 19 maternity hospitals are now fully compliant with that national guidance.</p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that this guidance was limited to planned attendances. Accordingly, the HSE's National Women and Infants Health Programme has advised that additional guidance was issued on 23 June to maternity hospitals. This guidance now addresses unplanned attendance, including at the Early Pregnancy Assessment Units, or emergency presentations in late pregnancy. The guidance also addresses attendance for women with at-risk pregnancies. I am advised that the HSE anticipates that a two-week period may be required to ensure all hospitals are able to address local logistical issues that might arise in implementing this additional guidance.  </p></reply>

However, members of the Oireachtas are advised that the HSE is currently unable to access the information to answer Parliamentary Questions due to the recent cyber-attack, which has required a temporary shut-down of HSE IT systems. The disruption to service is on-going, and the HSE is working hard to restore its IT capacity and resume normal services. Members of the Oireachtas will be advised as soon as the HSE is again in a position to provide responses to PQs and are encouraged to resubmit their Parliamentary Questions at that point.  </p>  <p>  Within the health and social care sector, service providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. For example, in relation to designated centres for older people, under Regulation 8 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to take all reasonable measures to protect residents from abuse.  The National Standards on Adult Safeguarding applicable to health and social care settings, published in 2019 by the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Mental Health Commission, note that health and social care services have a responsibility to do everything possible to prevent harm as a result of abuse, neglect or exploitation, that services have a responsibility to ensure that if harm occurs or is likely to occur that it is stopped and reported as quickly as possible and that services must respond effectively when harm does occur in order to minimise the impact of harm.</p>  <p>  In cases where there is an immediate or serious risk to a person's life or safety the emergency services should be contacted in the first instance. If a case of abuse is suspected to be a criminal matter, it should also be reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation and appropriate action.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that my Department is currently finalising the development of an over-arching national policy on adult safeguarding in the health sector, which will be issued for public consultation.</p></reply>

Under the guidance of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), the HSE has worked intensively to put in place a comprehensive, reliable and responsive testing and tracing operation and the contact tracing programme undergoes ongoing evaluation and development in response to changing demands and the evolving evidence relating to the pandemic. </p>  <p>  The Contact Tracing Centres are operating 12 hours a day, 7 days a week and are fully rostered every day. Recruitment of a dedicated workforce is a key part of the ongoing process improvement. The HSE has put in place a workforce dedicated to testing and tracing ensuring a high-level of support to our public health system who manage our more complex tracing operations. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the implementation of the National Operating Model for COVID-19 Test and Trace, with funding of &euro;445million allocated to the HSE for delivery of the service in 2021. A further strengthening of prevention and intervention measures will be undertaken in respect of track and trace, use of new testing technologies, and research and innovation throughout 2021. </p>  <p>  A number of new initiatives have been implemented including the collection of a more detailed history of source investigation for cases identified as &lsquo;community transmission&rsquo; along with the provision of walk-in testing facilities at static and pop-up test centres nationally and the subsequent establishment of alternative pathways for testing with the introduction of an online portal which allows pre-booking of a test appointment on the day of booking or for the following day. Process improvement includes a number of automation processes being put in place including the issuing of text messages to relay test results in order to decrease turnaround times. </p>  <p>  The Contact Management Programme (CMP) has introduced a follow-up call for cases on Day 4 which provides an opportunity for the contact tracers to reach out and reiterate some of the public health guidelines, to ask people if they are managing to follow the guidelines, managing to self-isolate/restrict their movements and to direct them to additional support resources at HSE.ie.</p>  <p>  Due to the risk posed by the transmission of the Delta variant, enhanced contact-tracing protocols are in place for all detected positive cases with a travel history from Great Britain, and the HSE has opened an online booking portal whereby travellers arriving in Ireland can pre-book a free 5-7 day PCR test up to 48 hrs prior to travelling.</p>  <p>  Work has commenced on updating the national testing strategy which will set out the testing and tracing considerations and priorities in the future and establish plans in relation to testing capacity and testing modalities and how these may be best deployed, and integrated, within the wider public health response, based on the potential demands that may arise over the coming months.</p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, NPHET considers and reviews, based on public health risk assessments, how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing and tracing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

In the health sector, the HSE has deployed rapid antigen tests for use for specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from rapid antigen tests undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, supported by the HSE, has implemented an antigen testing programme in food processing facilities, supplementing the PCR serial testing programme there. These tests are being carried out under clinical governance arrangements put in place by the Department of Agriculture. A further rapid testing pilot scheme began on June 14th in four universities including NUI Galway, Trinity College Dublin, UCD, and UCC. Operational planning is also underway in the HSE in relation to the piloting of testing using RADTs in other education and childcare settings. This includes development of guidance documentation, a training programme and other related templates and resources to support the testing pathway for educational facilities. </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Report of the COVID-19 Rapid Testing Group&rdquo; which was chaired at my request by the Government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Mark Ferguson, and published on 1 April 2021, made a number of recommendations for sectors outside the health sector and these are a matter for the Ministers and Departments with responsibility for the sectors concerned.</p>  <p>  The HSE has recently published the report of the Antigen Test Validation Project which validated a number of rapid antigen detection tests (ADTS) intended for testing samples for SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The products evaluated were chosen as those expected to represent the best available products based on the manufacturers claims and other available evidence. The recommendations in this report will assist in the consideration of any other potential applications of rapid antigen detection tests to support the overall national testing strategy. </p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, the National Public Health Emergency Team considers and reviews how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population. This includes keeping Ireland&rsquo;s national testing and tracing policy under continuing review.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020. </p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. </p><p>The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department , following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.). The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most; facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country; improving transparency and fairness.  </p><p>Further details are available here: <i>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/93f8f-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-irelands-vaccination-prioritisation-list/.</i></p></reply>

While there is still a high level of infection nationally, the situation is considered reasonably stable and significant progress is being made in relation to the roll-out of our vaccination programme.   </p>  <p>  On 28 May, Government decided to move ahead with the process of lifting restrictions further and a range of measures were eased in June. </p>  <p>  The Government has indicated that a further easing of measures will be considered from 5 July subject to the epidemiological situation at the time and this would include permitting communions and confirmations to take place. Government will give consideration to whether this further easing can proceed as planned next week. </p>  <p>  As outlined on Gov.ie, when communions and confirmations are permitted, any related family gatherings should strictly adhere to the prevailing public health advice on household mixing, including visitors to your home and indoor and outdoor dining and any decision to schedule such ceremonies should take account of the disease situation in the local community (www.gov.ie/en/press-release/7894b-post-cabinet-statement-resilience-and-recovery-the-path-ahead/#what-you-can-do-in-july-subject-to-the-public-health-situation-at-the-time). </p>  <p>  While there has been scope to continue with the easing of public health measures, our approach must continue to be cautious, gradual and on a phased basis, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact. This will be critical to ensure that our progress in controlling the virus is maintained. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus over recent months due to the huge effort of people across the country. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. To protect the gains of recent months we must continue to practice basic preventative behaviours and to follow public health guidelines.  </p></reply>

In order to protect women, babies, staff and our maternity service as a whole, it has been necessary to introduce restrictions on attendance at maternity services. This has unfortunately included limitations on access of partners to maternity wards, theatres and appointments.  My Department and the HSE have been engaging closely in relation to this matter.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that in mid-May a review of compliance was conducted in all maternity hospitals/units, based on the HSE-AMRIC national guidance in place. At that time, the HSE confirmed that 14 of the 19 maternity hospitals/units were fully compliant with the guidance.  As of last week, the HSE has advised that all 19 maternity hospitals are now fully compliant with that national guidance.</p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that this guidance was limited to planned attendances. Accordingly, the HSE's National Women and Infants Health Programme has advised that additional guidance was issued on 23 June to maternity hospitals. This guidance now addresses unplanned attendance, including at the Early Pregnancy Assessment Units, or emergency presentations in late pregnancy. The guidance also addresses attendance for women with at-risk pregnancies. I am advised that the HSE anticipates that a two-week period may be required to ensure all hospitals are able to address local logistical issues that might arise in implementing this additional guidance.</p></reply>

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.</p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department of Health, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness.</p><p>Further details on the updated allocation strategy are available here:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/93f8f-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-irelands-vaccination-prioritisation-list/</p><p>Vaccine registration for those aged 35 to 39 has opened.</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. You can find more information on the rollout of the vaccine and the progress of vaccinations here:</p><p>www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/rollout/</p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. People who are vaccinated need to continue with all the public health measures that have been proven to reduce the risk of infection, i.e., limiting our social contacts, physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoiding non-essential travel until a sufficiently large proportion of the population are immune.</p></reply>

The professions of counsellor and psychotherapist were designated for regulation by the Minister under the Act and will be regulated by CORU.  </p><p>Regulations to designate the two professions under the Act and to establish the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board were made in 2018. The Board was appointed in February 2019 and held its inaugural meeting in May 2019. The work of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board is significantly more challenging than for registration boards for some of the more established professions, owing to the different and complex entry paths into these professions, the variety of titles used, and the variety and number of courses and course providers.</p><p>The Board is now undertaking the substantial work required to open the registers for counsellors and psychotherapists. This work includes the scoping of professions and titles and the consideration of the minimum qualifications to be required of existing practitioners and for future graduates.</p><p>When the Board has opened the register and the transitional period to allow existing practitioners to register is completed, it will be an offence for anyone not registered to use any protected titles. All registrants will also be subject to the fitness to practise process in CORU which provides for sanctions against registrants when complaints are proven. </p><p>In relation to workforce planning, the Programme for Government commits the Department of Health to working with the education sectors, regulators, and professional bodies to improve the availability of health professionals and reform their training to support integrated care across the entire health service.</p><p><i>Sharing the Vision - A Mental Health Policy for Everyone </i>(2020), aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020-2030. The policy envisages an expansion of mental health service provision across the whole system, necessitating a significant skill mix analysis and human resource development. Consequently, to realise the policy recommendations, a comprehensive workforce planning initiative is required. The National Implementation and Monitoring Committee (NIMC), charged with implementation monitoring of national mental health policy Sharing the Vision (2020) has identified workforce planning in the mental health sector as a key enabler to the implementation of this policy and consistent service improvement over the next ten years.</p><p>The HSE Report on Workforce Planning Mental Health: Assessing Supply and Demand (October 2018) www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/our-workforce/resources/workforce-planning-report-mhs.pdf.</p><p>and the HSE Report of the National Psychology Project Team (January 2021) www.hse.ie/eng/staff/jobs/eligibility-criteria/psychology-report-jan-2021.pdf  are relevant HSE initiatives in relation to workforce planning in mental health services. </p></reply>

Pay restoration commenced in April 2019. Any outstanding balance would be paid in two equal amounts in 2020 and 2021, if due.</p><p>The agreement reached at the WRC noted that some of the organisations (approximately 250) which did not form part of the pilot phase are also likely to have pay restoration issues.

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020.</p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed.</p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department of Health, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.).</p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness.</p><p>Further details on the updated allocation strategy are available here:</p><p>www.gov.ie/en/press-release/93f8f-minister-donnelly-announces-update-to-irelands-vaccination-prioritisation-list/</p><p>Vaccine registration for those aged 35 to 39 has opened.</p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. You can find more information on the rollout of the vaccine and the progress of vaccinations here:</p><p>www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/rollout/</p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. People who are vaccinated need to continue with all the public health measures that have been proven to reduce the risk of infection, i.e., limiting our social contacts, physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoiding non-essential travel until a sufficiently large proportion of the population are immune.</p></reply>

This ban was lifted in November 2020, but a limit was placed on the number allowed to leave the Philippines to ensure that enough healthcare workers would remain at home to help in the fight against the pandemic. This amount was initially set at 5,000 in respect of healthcare workers. We understand from the Department of Foreign Affairs that this has been increased to 6,500 in recent days. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the process for applying for an exemption is challenging and requires complex negotiation. Ireland does not have an embassy in the Philippines at present but is in the process of opening one in Manila, it is hoped that this will be in place in later in the year.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department are currently liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs who are monitoring the situation. Officials are also seeking clarity from the HSE regarding the extent of the impact of this cap on workforce planning in our health service. When we have further information on the matter a decision will be taken regarding what next steps are required.</p></reply>

The report set out how personalised budgets could work as a funding mechanism for people with a disability. </p>  <p>  Personalised budgets can help to provide people with disabilities with greater choice and control over the services and supports they receive. </p>  <p>  The Task Force reviewed national and international research and consulted with service users and their families. They recommended that the Department of Health, with the HSE, should establish a pilot project to test the delivery of personalised budgets -  the aim being to identify the best approach to roll-out personalised budgets following this pilot phase.</p>  <p>  Funding can be spent on specific personal supports funded by the HSE such as employing your own support worker or having support staff at a time you choose. These supports will be agreed and identified in a personal support plan for each participant. The funding is allocated by the HSE.</p>  <p>  Funding cannot be spent on informal care from a partner or close relative or to pay for supports that would normally be provided by another Government Department or Statutory Agency, e.g. housing.</p>  <p>  The Personalsied Budget pilot is open to adults with a disability that are currently in receipt of HSE funded services. This included appropriate school leavers in 2019 and 2020. </p>  <p>  It is hoped that the pilot will have up to 180 participants over two phases who access day services, residential services, respite services, rehabilitative training and personal assistance.</p>  <p>  Some other variables that the HSE are also considering in relation to the sample of participants include types of disability, complexity of need, CHO and type of funding models.</p>  <p>  In order to take part in the pilot, participants submitted an expression of interest. Expressions of interest for phase 2 closed in September 2020 and the HSE received 136 applications. Due to COVID-19 there was a pause in processing applications, so applications are still being processed.</p>  <p>  There are currently 55 participants in the various stages of the pilot. This means that the pilot is running behind schedule. This is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the closure of services, and then the knock-on effect that this has had in making it difficult to recruit staff for the HSE team.

The Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and my Department, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020. </p><p>On the 23rd of February, I announced an update to Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Strategy. In comprising the initial Vaccine Allocation Strategy, the NIAC listed several conditions associated with increased risk of severe disease and death. In the intervening period, national and international evidence has become available which has enabled a more detailed analysis of underlying conditions that may increase the risk of developing severe disease or death. The NIAC has now been able to more comprehensively identify those medical conditions and to distinguish between those which place a person at very high or high risk of severe disease if they contract the virus. Medical conditions and the magnitude of the risk they pose will continue to be monitored and periodically reviewed. </p><p>On the 30th of March, the Government approved a further update to the COVID-19 Vaccination Allocation Strategy. Based on clinical, scientific and ethical frameworks produced by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and my Department of Health, following the vaccination of those most at risk, future groups will be vaccinated by age, in cohorts of 10 years (i.e., 64-55; 54-45, etc.). </p><p>The move to an age-based model better supports the programme objectives by:</p><p>- protecting those at highest risk of severe disease first, which benefits everyone most;</p><p>- facilitating planning and execution of the programme across the entire country;</p><p>- improving transparency and fairness.</p><p>Further details on the updated allocation strategy are available here: </p><p> </p><p>You may wish to note that vaccine registration for those aged 35 to 39 has opened. </p><p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is the responsibility of the HSE. You can find more information on the rollout of the vaccine and the progress of vaccinations here: </p><p> </p><p>It is important to emphasise that vaccination is only one part of our response to the prevention of COVID-19 infection. People who are vaccinated need to continue with all the public health measures that have been proven to reduce the risk of infection, i.e., limiting our social contacts, physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoiding non-essential travel until a sufficiently large proportion of the population are immune.</p></reply>

In the Council General Approach, I negotiated for the subsidiarity for Member States to apply capping of payments. </p>  <p>  Some of the basic principles around these figures were agreed in the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2021-2027 earlier last year, and transferred across.  However, the proposals agreed at Council would see this capping extended further in a degressive manner. These flexibilities would allow Member States to implement capping on a degressive basis starting from &euro;60,000 and rising to 100% capping above &euro;100,000 of the new BISS payment. </p>  <p>  In all these negotiations, I have continuously fought for Ireland to have the maximum flexibility to implement the new CAP regulations, including flexibility on the issue of capping of BISS payments  to ensure the best outcome for Irish farmers.  The political agreement reached yesterday provides for voluntary capping at &euro;100,000, and further degressivity, or reduction of payments for payments over &euro;60,000 whichI have continually supported as a way of bringing fairness and equality to the CAP. These options will be considered along with the other elements of the agreement in the course of consultations that will take place with stakeholders over the coming weeks and months.</p></reply>

Any BEAM participant who is currently still in a TB restriction will see their 5% bovine nitrates reduction requirement reduce over the duration of that restriction. Letters explaining this process issued in recent weeks to some 2,000 BEAM participants who fell into this category and, as new restrictions are registered, further letters will issue to BEAM participants concerned.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to provide a monthly update to all BEAM participants with the bovine figures up to 30th April 2021 available on Agfood.ie.

Such measures could reward action to increase carbon sequestration on farms, for example, by encouraging sustainable management practices to reduce carbon loss from land.  </p><p>Most recently the European Commission has published a Technical Guidance Handbook on setting up and implementing result-based carbon farming mechanisms which my officials are currently reviewing.</p><p>Through AgClimatise, the National Climate and Air Roadmap for the Agriculture Sector, I have committed to develop a pilot scheme for on-farm carbon trading, recognising the importance that our farmers play in storing carbon at farm level.</p><p>To build the knowledge and evidence base to support such a scheme, there are a number of new research projects and pilot studies in recent months, such as the National Soil Sampling Programme, which seek to improve the measurement of the greenhouse gas emission profile of Irish farms, which will be essential in providing the necessary data to realise the potential of carbon farming in Ireland. In addition projects such as the EIP Rewetting of Farmed Peatland Pilot Projects, along with the establishment of a National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory will all aim to address the knowledge deficit surrounding on farm carbon balances. </p><p>The Farm to Fork Strategy also includes a commitment for a legislative proposal to reduce the EU&rsquo;s contribution to global deforestation and forest degradation.</p><p>The Department already supports afforestation, in a variety of configurations.

The then Minister amended the Mackerel policy in July 2017 after intensive review and public consultation. This amendment did not involve the hook and line fishery.  The mackerel Policy sets down that the hook and line fishery for vessels under 15m in overall length receive 400t.  </p>  <p>  In order to amend Mackerel Policy, I must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect policy, it would require due process involving an assessment of all issues arising, including full public consultation.  </p>  <p>  There has been, for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for access to and a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU/U.K. Trade and Co-operation Agreement provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota by 2026 to the U.K.  This will only increase demands for higher shares of Ireland&rsquo;s quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet.  The Deputy should be aware that the 400t for the hook and line fishery has not been reduced and has remained the same as in previous years. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the situation is that if there is an increase for any sector in the allocation made available, such as for the boats less than 15 meters in the hook and line fishery, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the EU/ U.K. TCA.</p></reply>

The situation that arose relates to a private commercial transaction between two contracting parties to purchase a vessel. The responsibility for ensuring the authenticity of the details, specifications and stability of the vessel being purchased rested with the purchaser. </p>  <p>  The core issue here relates to the safety and safety certification of the vessel purchased.  The safety of fishing vessels and safety certification, including matters relating to stability, is the responsibility of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has no function in relation to the safety certification of Fishing vessels or matters arising in relation to their stability. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme is the principal source of development funding for our seafood sector.  The Programme is implemented under the provisions of the EMFF Regulation (508/2014) which specifies to what purposes funds can be granted.  There is no particular provision of the EMFF Regulation that would facilitate an ex-gratia payment to assist in the case raised by the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it is not possible to provide a grant for the decommissioning of the vessel concerned, as under the terms of the EMFF Regulation, decommissioning is not permitted after 31 December 2018.  A new EU Regulation for the 2021-27 period is expected to be enacted in July 2021 and while the draft Regulation may permit decommissioning in the future, it may only be implemented for very specific purposes concerned with addressing an identified imbalance in a particular fleet segment and only for active fishing vessels.</p>  <p>  When these matters were raised with me at a recent virtual Townhall Meeting, I agreed to have a one-to-one telephone conversation in the context of my Ministerial legislative remit. I am making arrangements to have this telephone conversation shortly.</p></reply>

The payment is linked to an agreed work plan for the section of the trail maintained by the landholder.  </p>  <p>  The Walks Scheme is currently operating on 45 trails supported by 2,040 landholders and is being managed by 16 Local Development Companies (LDCs) around the country.</p>  <p>  In December 2019, it was announced that 10 new trails would be added to the Scheme under the first phase of an expansion of the scheme. While the process of inspecting these new trails was delayed in part due to the COVID-19 restrictions, an online system was developed in late 2020 to carry out the necessary checks and inspections. To date, 6 of these new trails have been approved and payments have issued to landholders.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to expand the Walks Scheme to achieve a target of 80 trails. A decision in respect of the further trails to be added to the Scheme will be taken following the publication of an external review of the Walks Scheme. I expect to be in a position to publish the review shortly. </p>  <p>  Trails that wish to be added to the scheme are invited to submit an Expression of Interest to my Department.  There is no closing date for Expressions of Interest at this time, and interested parties can continue to submit proposals for additional trails to be included in the scheme, through their Local Authority or Local Development Company. A trail must meet specific qualifying criteria in order to be considered eligible for the scheme, including being of a suitable standard to be included in Sport Ireland Outdoors' trail register.</p></reply>

This is a key focus of the Government's new rural development policy <i>Our Rural Future.</i></p><p>Remote working, supported by appropriate infrastructure and facilities, has the potential to encourage more people to live in rural areas while working in good quality jobs, no matter where their employer is based. It can also help revitalise our rural town if remote working hubs are developed in their centres.</p><p>The National Hub Network expanded from a &euro;1m scheme that was funded under the 2019 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plan. This project was originally scoped to develop a hub network, supported by a shared online platform for remote working facilities in the Atlantic Economic Corridor. However, in light of the clear demand for such a network across the county, this was expanded to a national project that would support both <i>Our Rural Future </i>and the National Remote Working strategy.</p><p>I launched the National Hub Network, connectedhubs.ie, on 31 May in the Swinford Digiwest Hub in Co. Mayo. Since the launch less than a month ago, a further 13 hubs have been added to the platform with an additional 34 in the process of being onboarded. Furthermore, the number of hubs identified through the Western Development Commission's hub discovery process has increased from 390 to 477 in that time. These are in the process of being verified before they are mapped on . This interacive map shows all the hubs that are verified as part of the discovery process, and also provides useful information in relation to each of the hubs and the services that are available at each site.</p><p>This represents significant progress and demonstrates the value of the network. I am confident that the ambitious targets that I set for the development of the network will be exceeded by year end.</p></reply>

The scheme is funded by my Department and is administered through the Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  There was no funding for the Local Improvement Scheme for a number of years until it was relaunched in 2017. Since then, over &euro;68 million  has been allocated to deliver the scheme on over 2,400 roads. The Scheme has benefited over 10,000 residents and landowners. </p>  <p>  I announced funding of &euro;10.5 million in May under the 2021 Scheme. This represented a 5% increase on the previous year and saw an increase in each local authority's allocation.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that I am actively exploring the potential to allocate further funding for the scheme in 2021 should the budgetary position allow. I would again urge each Local Authority to utilise the funding already announced for this year to complete the repair works on selected roads at an early date.
