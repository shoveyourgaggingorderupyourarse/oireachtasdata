Provided that they do not resign from their current employment, there should be no obstacle to retaining their statutory redundancy entitlements.</p>  <p>  Officials of the Department of Social Protection have already met with both the Receiver and employee representatives to provide information and assurances regarding measures taken to accept online applications for income support as quickly as possible.  My Government colleague, Heather Humphreys TD, Minister for Social Protection, has already gone on record to encourage individuals now seeking jobseekers payments to apply on line so that her Department can process their claims as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection will provide all relevant supports through the local Intreo Offices and will proactively help employees to access opportunities available for employment or appropriate training and development.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been in regular contact with the company and Officials have had discussions with the Acting CEO  to investigate whether any Roadbridge contracts can be fulfilled by other operators in the market.  This, however, will be challenging given the current inflationary pressures.  </p>  <p>  The Receiver has given an undertaking to continue discussions with Enterprise Ireland on the ground in the coming days to further discuss how Enterprise Ireland can further support employees, sub-contractors and sub-suppliers impacted by the receivership.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to liaise with all stakeholders in order to fully determine the scale of the potential adverse impacts on sub-suppliers and sub-contractors and the progress of the infrastructural projects concerned with a view to considering what options are available in terms of how these projects might be sustained.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally, and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant transport operators.  </p>  <p>  Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system particularly in areas which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services. In recognition of this, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic the Government have provided temporary financial supports for certain licensed commercial services with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.</p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months in June 2020, however owing to the continued impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue, these supports have been extended a number of times. I understand that a further extension of these supports for a period of 3 months, up to the 30 June 2022 has recently been approved by my colleague Minister Eamon Ryan TD.</p>  <p>  Additionally, to ensure the continued continuation of public transport services in rural parts of Ireland, the NTA have provided an additional level of subvention to support Local Link operators in the delivery of these services. These are provided to Local Link operators who are on fixed rate contracts and therefore are receiving no further increases to their base contracted rates. Currently, the funding has been provided to cover the costs for Quarter 1 2022. This is a once off payment initially, and the situation will be monitored on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-23a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032300071#WRA01700"><p>The current spike in energy prices arises from the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in conjunction with current international tensions and supply constraint issues. The causes of these price pressures are not within our control. This is being witnessed across the European Union as well as many other regions. The recent crisis in Ukraine has had a further dramatic impact on fuel prices.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with the sector, on 11 March 2022 my colleague, Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan T.D., and Minister of State with responsibility for International and Road Transport and Logistics, Hildegarde Naughton T.D., announced an emergency support measure for licensed hauliers to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices. This targeted, temporary grant scheme will provide a fixed payment of &euro;100 per week for each heavy goods vehicle (over 3.5 tonnes) as listed on a road haulage operator&rsquo;s licence. The scheme will operate for a period of 8 weeks and will be reviewed thereafter. The estimated cost to the State for the temporary measure is &euro;18 million. Details on how to avail of the scheme will be communicated to hauliers.</p>  <p>  In addition to the scheme, you will also be aware that the Government on 9 March 2022 reduced Excise duty by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil in order to reduce the cost of fuels.</p>  <p>  Further, the Diesel Rebate Scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators when the price of diesel is high. In Budget 2020, in light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry, the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.32 (VAT inclusive) was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre. In recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, this increase has been maintained since.</p>  <p>  In addition, businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs, such as road diesel and other motoring costs.</p>  <p>  There are also supports available for operators to switch to alternatively fuelled vehicles. These include a purchase grant and reduced tolls for vehicles powered by a number of alternative fuels including hydrogen, electric, and gas. In addition, Budget 2022 announced an expansion of the Accelerated Capital Allowance (&lsquo;ACA&rsquo;) scheme for Gas Vehicles and Refuelling Equipment. This ACA scheme provides an accelerated wear and tear allowance for capital expenditure incurred on qualifying vehicles and refuelling equipment. </p>  <p>  The past two years have presented many challenges for the sector &ndash; the measures outlined above reflect Government&rsquo;s understanding of that pressure and recognition of the important role that the haulage industry plays in keeping the country going.  The issue will continue to be monitored as it evolves. </p></reply>

The National Dialogue on Climate Action will be a key mechanism for facilitating this social dialogue and will include processes of awareness-raising, communications, and activation, and ensure community engagement and participation, using a model co-designed with stakeholder participation and informed by broad public participation and social and behavioural research. The Climate Action Plan also anticipates that individual sectors will play a key role in facilitating inclusive social dialogue to design and implement their respective climate policies in a way which promotes a just transition.  Young people are essential voices in these processes, particularly given the importance of the inter-generational impacts of climate change. </p>  <p>  In respect of ongoing work in the Midlands region,  a public consultation on a draft of Ireland&rsquo;s Territorial Just Transition Plan for the EU Just Transition Fund took place between 20 December 2021 and 14 February 2022.  Feedback was gathered through an online survey and three participative online public workshops. One of these workshops specifically sought the views of young people aged 16 to 24 living, working, or studying in the wider Midlands region. Representatives of the National Youth Council and the Irish Second-level Students' Union were invited and participated in this workshop. These views were captured and will be reflected in the consultation report, which summarises themes emerging in the responses received. This report will be published on gov.ie in the coming weeks and public consultation outputs will now be used to further develop and finalise the draft Territorial Just Transition Plan, before it is sent to Government for agreement.On approval by Government, the plan, together with the associated EU Just Transition Fund programme, will be submitted to the European Commission for approval during the course of 2022. </p></reply>

The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place to alleviate fuel and energy poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. Examples of key recent developments include:  </p>  <p>  - Budget 2022 incorporated a range of measures to support citizens with the rising cost of living.  These measures included increases to weekly social welfare payments, targeted measures with increases in the living alone allowance and the qualified child increase and a &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate of fuel allowance, with that increase implemented immediately in October.  The weekly income threshold for Fuel Allowance was also increased by &euro;20 which enables more people to qualify for this support.</p>  <p>  - Further measures were recently announced to help mitigate the effects of rising energy costs.  As part of these measures an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment.  This lump sum payment, in addition to the Budget increase, will mean low-income households will see an increase of 41% this fuel allowance season when compared to last season. </p>  <p>  - This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. These supports are available nationwide and are linked to a household&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  - A payment of &euro;200 (inclusive of VAT) will also be paid to all domestic electricity accounts as part of the Government&rsquo;s package of measures to provide further support to households in the context of increased living costs.</p>  <p>  In addition to the measures outlined above, the CRU has in place a suite of protections against disconnection that are set out in the Supplier Handbook. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time. Accordingly any customers who are experiencing difficulties with their Bills should engage with their supplier to discuss the various options and assistance available.</p></reply>

The first RESS auction for onshore wind and solar projects was held in 2020 and the second RESS auction process has begun with the qualification application window having closed in January and the auction is scheduled to take place in May. Design of the RESS 3 onshore auction is also currently under development and my Department is also finalising the terms and conditions on the first of three planned auctions this decade for the offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (ORESS). </p>  <p>  The Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS), approved by Government on 21 December 2021, will provide capital grants for new domestic and small non-domestic installations. Businesses, including farms, who install new larger installations can avail of a Clean Export Premium tariff which will provide a fixed tariff for 15 years for electricity exported to the grid. The scheme design will be published shortly however the phased introduction of supports commenced in February with the transition of the domestic solar PV grant scheme. In addition to this, a tax disregard of &euro;200 was introduced in Budget 2021 in respect of personal income received by households who sell residual renewable electricity they generate back to the grid.</p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a support scheme for small-scale generators, i.e. above 50kW but smaller than those supported by the RESS, which will be progressed in 2022 and is expected to become available in 2023. This scheme will enable larger businesses, farms and community projects to maximise their participation in the energy transition. </p>  <p>  Other financial supports available for renewable energy projects include tax-based incentives for the development of renewable technologies such as the Accelerated Capital Allowances Scheme and the Employment and Investment Incentive as well as improvements for farm enterprises supported by the Department for Agriculture, Food and Marine, under the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme as part of the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS). All of the above schemes help incentivise the delivery of renewable energy projects in order to meet our up to 80% renewable electricity by 2030 target.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.   </p>  <p>  I appreciate people&rsquo;s frustration when they are living close to a fibre network, owned by a commercial operator, but cannot obtain a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 11 March 2022, almost 311,000 premises have been surveyed or have survey underway, with over 157,000 premises constructed or under construction across all counties. NBI has also advised that premises are connected in 16 counties; Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Wexford and Wicklow and almost 60,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 22 counties.  In County Westmeath pre-works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Athlone and Delvin and main works are underway in the Deployment Area of Mullingar, with almost 6,000 premises under construction and over 1,000 premises now available to pre-order.  I am advised by NBI that it expects the premises referred to in the Question to be passed and available for connection in H1, 2022.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Westmeath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users.  </p>  <p>  Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, www.nbi.ie, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.  </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 11 March 2022, 523 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Westmeath 6 BCPs have been installed to date including Clonkill Hurling Club, which is approximately 5.5km from the premises referred to. Further details can be found at nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.  </p>  <p>  In County Westmeath 4 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.   </p></reply>

This communication sets out new actions to ramp up the production of green energy, diversify supplies and reduce demand, focusing primarily on gas, which significantly influences the electricity market and where the global market is less liquid. Ireland will work closely with the European Commission and Member States to deliver upon this ambition.  </p>  <p>  In the immediate tern, Ireland is  continuing to monitor international energy (gas and oil) markets and to consult with its EU and international partners on appropriate measures, if necessary, to ensure energy security in light of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. The European Commission is engaging with other countries to ensure sufficient and timely supply of natural gas to the EU from diverse sources across the globe to avoid supply shocks, including those that could result from disruptions. </p>  <p>  This crisis in Ukraine has brought into sharp focus the EU and Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on fossil fuel imports. We must continue to accelerate the clean energy transition, focussing on energy efficiency and renewable energies. The best way to secure our energy needs is to continue to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy. Climate Action Plan 2021 sets us on a pathway to reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels dramatically by 2030. </p>  <p>My Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems. This review is being carried out for the period to 2030, in the context of net zero emissions by no later than 2050. This includes examining potential risks and potential mitigating options for such risks.   </p></reply>

Over the coming months, my Department will take measures to increase the supply of renewable energy sources in line with these targets and the overriding public need to accelerate the delivery of renewable energy projects in the context of energy price increases and energy market volatility resulting from Russia's war on Ukraine. </p>  <p>  The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is Ireland&rsquo;s flagship policy to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s target of up to 80% renewable electricity by the end of the decade. The first RESS auction for onshore wind and solar projects was held in 2020 and the first RESS 1 projects have now reached commercial operation with further projects to reach commercial operation throughout 2022. </p>  <p>  The second RESS auction process has begun with the qualification application window having closed in January and the auction is scheduled to take place in May. Design of the RESS 3 onshore auction is also currently under development and my Department is also finalising the terms and conditions on the first of three planned auctions this decade for the offshore Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (ORESS).</p>  <p>  The Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021 was developed last year to provide the legal underpinning to an entirely new marine planning system, which will balance harnessing our huge offshore wind potential with protecting our rich and unique marine environment. In Q1 2022, my Department opened a consultation on the proposed assessment criteria for the first batch of Maritime Area Consent (MAC) applications from a set of seven qualified ORE projects. Consultation is also currently open on how the second batch of projects (Phase 2) will be selected to enter the new consenting system. </p>  <p>  I have recently signed Regulations, which provide for the Clean Export Guarantee tariff, into Irish law allowing  for micro-and small-scale generators to receive remuneration from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity exported to the grid. In addition, my Department is working with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on a policy design for a small-scale generation support scheme. This will be progressed in 2022 and will become available in 2023. </p>  <p>  As regards renewable heat and cooling, the SEAI published the National Heat Study on 22 February 2022. The Study, which was prepared at my Department&rsquo;s request, contains detailed analysis which will now facilitate the development of options, policies and measures to decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors to 2050 and will be a key input into the delivery of a number of actions contained in the Climate Action Plan 2022.</p></reply>

The Deputy may be aware that work on the latest NTA Review of the national maximum fare is well underway, and fuel costs are a major contributor in considering fare increases.  The objective of the Review is to determine whether changes need to be made to the current level of maximum fares in response to market changes facing the taxi industry as well as changes in annual taxi operating costs.  The NTA has confirmed that it is endeavouring to conclude the review process as quickly as possible in 2022 whilst still ensuring that all steps, including a consultation process, are appropriately completed. </p>  <p>  In relation to the rising cost of fuel, the Government announced on March 9th last, a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil. Excise duty is being reduced by 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent per litre of diesel. These reductions are in place until 31 August 2022 and should help to reduce the operating costs of non-electric SPSVs.</p>  <p>  Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of my commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero/low-emission vehicles, I announced on February 4th last, the re-opening of the eSPSV Grant Scheme, with a further &euro;15 million allocated to it for 2022.  The grants will enable owners of taxis and hackneys, to buy electric vehicles (EVs).</p>  <p>  Administered by the NTA, SPSV drivers can apply for grants of up to &euro;10,000 towards the purchase of a new, full-battery eSPSV, with a further &euro;2,500 available to convert it to a wheelchair-accessible model.  Taxi drivers are eligible for double the normal grant when they scrap an older, more polluting or high mileage vehicle and make the switch to electric. By scrapping and switching, up to &euro;20,000 can be available for a new, fully electric SPSV and if the taxi is a wheelchair-accessible electric vehicle, the supports rise to &euro;25,000.  A driver can apply to combine both the eSPSV grant scheme and the WAV grant scheme up to a maximum of &euro;32,500.</p>  <p>  The take-up rate for this Scheme was exceptionally high in 2021: almost 600 drivers successfully applied for grants, with over &euro;11 million paid out as well as &euro;4 million in provisional grant offers.  The operation of the Scheme is a matter for the NTA and details of the Scheme are available on the NTA&rsquo;s website. </p></reply>

The estimated cost of the backlog is in excess of &euro;5 billion. </p><p>Because of the pressures on the regional and local road network, approximately 90% of available Exchequer grant assistance to local authorities for regional and local roads is being directed to maintenance and renewal works rather than for new roads or for road realignments. </p><p>In this context there has been significant increases in Exchequer grants for regional and local roads particularly in the recent years. The 2022 regional and local road grants were notified to local authorities on the 15<sup>th</sup>February and Monaghan County Council has been allocated a total of &euro;15,868,600 million which compares to an allocation of &euro;7,684,950 million in 2017.</p><p>The Department's grant funding for the maintenance of regional and local roads is allocated to local authorities on a pro-rata basis, determined mainly by the length of the regional and local road network in the county. The Department appreciates that, within the overall parameters set for the grant programme, local authorities might need to target funding at particular problem areas and there is sufficient flexibility in the structure of the grant programme to allow for this. It is also open to each local authority to allocate its own resources to priority areas.</p><p>A response to the correspondence referred to will issue to Monaghan County Council shortly.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-23a.124.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032300073#WRC01300"><p>Since the COVID-19 situation first arose, I have maintained contact with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) and banks on the measures the sector has put in place to assist their customers who are economically impacted by the pandemic.  In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on employment supports on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times.  If a mortgage applicant has any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application they should in the first instance contact their lender directly.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there are also general consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a Central Bank regulated mortgage lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  </p>  <p>  The CMCAR further provides that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on regulated lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code states that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved and provide these reasons on paper if requested.  </p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender and it is not possible for me to give instructions to lenders on such matters.  However, if a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with the way a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for a mortgage or the drawn down of a mortgage, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm. If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, they can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. </p></reply>

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exemption from VAT.  In addition, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of VAT exemption to the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage. This means that the supplier does not register for VAT, does not charge VAT on the supply of their services and has no VAT recovery entitlement on costs where such costs are used for the exempt supply of passenger transport.</p>  <p>  Ireland may continue to apply the VAT exemption on the supply of domestic passenger transport as governed by Article 371 of the VAT Directive; however, it cannot change the conditions under which the exemption was granted. In accordance with the Directive, a reduced rate of VAT (Ireland currently has two reduced VAT rates, 9% and 13.5%) could be introduced to the supply of passenger transport in place of the exemption that currently applies; this would give the transport operator deductibility in relation to VAT on their business inputs but would involve charging passengers VAT on their fares. Under the Directive it is not possible to apply the zero rate in Ireland to these services, as their supply was never zero rated in the past.</p></reply>

While the initial policy focused primarily on board fees, it has been expanded over time to cover any type of potential second income from a public service source that might accrue to a civil or public sector employee. </p><p>Additional payment may be made for undertaking other work in the public sector if certain conditions apply. Sanction for such payments are considered where Departments put forward a supporting business case and where it is established, that each of the following conditions is met:</p><p>1.  that the duties involved  are neither a part nor an extension of the officer&rsquo;s normal duties, and</p><p>2.  that a rigid insistence  on the principle of one person-one salary would deny scarce skills to the State, and that payment is permitted  for one additional appointment only, and</p><p>3.  that the approval of  the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for additional payments  is required in each case, and</p><p>4.  that in no case should payment exceed the normal fee for the activity concerned, and</p><p>5.  that the duration of such payment should be limited to one term or 5 years whichever is greater.</p><p>Where a Department is satisfied that each of the conditions is met, application for sanction should be made to my Department. Such applications are considered and a decision is given by reference to the conditions quoted above.</p><p>It is normal practice that such cases are made by a Department based on an identified business need and not by an individual who is seeking an additional payment.  Consequently, there is no appeals mechanism available to an individual. </p></reply>

Where previously, bodies had to be explicitly listed in the legislation for FOI to apply to them, in the updated legislation, any entity that meets a broad set of criteria is subject to FOI by default.  At present, approximately 600 diverse organisations are subject to FOI, across the civil and public sector. The criteria are generally concerned with governance and control of the entity.  </p>  <p>  However, it is important to be clear of the full extent of the reach of FOI.  Often what is referred to as "state funding" of an organisation in fact comprises of remuneration for services provided to a state body.  Where this is the case, the FOI legislation provides for access to records, even where they may be physically held by a private company or body, where they relate to a service to provided to a public sector body that is subject to FOI.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, the reach of the FOI legislation as it is presently structured is comprehensive in terms of state entities, and the legislation can in appropriate cases go beyond this in order to ensure that functions performed by state entities cannot be "contracted out" so as to avoid FOI.  In this context, there are at present no specific plans to expand the already broad scope of the FOI legislation.</p>  <p>  However, I have initiated a review of the FOI legislation and related issues which is ongoing in my Department.  An initial public consultation took place in late 2021, with almost 1,200 submissions from all sectors.  A document setting out the key themes identified by this process will be published in the coming weeks, which will be followed by a further chance for all interested stakeholders to have their say.</p>  <p>  The review will provide an opportunity to plot a course for FOI policy as well as in general "doing transparency" more effectively and in a manner that is fit for today's world and workplace.  I would like again to take this opportunity to encourage all members of this House, and any other interested parties, to engage with the review process in order to provide the benefit of their experience and insights, and any comments, queries or suggestions they may have.</p></reply>

The rate of the levy increased to 7% for sites listed on local authority vacant sites registers from 2019 onwards which site owners became liable to pay in January of the following year.</p>  <p>  The most recent data available in relation to the collection of the levy is based on returns submitted to my Department further to the issuing of Circular Letter PL 03/2021 on 8 March 2021 requesting the submission of a progress report on the implementation and collection of the levy by each local authority in respect of the previous year, 2020. </p>  <p>  The returns received further to that request indicated that local authorities issued levy demands totalling &euro;11,883,200 in respect of 2020. The final amount collected in respect of 2020 will not be available until local authorities submit final returns for that year, which will be requested shortly in association with an initial data request in respect of 2021. </p>  <p>  For information, the returns submitted by local authorities in 2020 indicated that levy demands totalling &euro;13,296,481 were issued in respect of the previous year (2019) and that the amount of levy collected in that year was &euro;1,183,700. It should be noted that under section 19 of the Act, unpaid levies due remain a charge on the land in question until they are paid. My Department will continue to engage proactively with local authorities to ensure that all vacant site levies due are paid and that the measure can achieve its full potential.</p></reply>

Ukraine, in particular, has made impressive progress in aligning with EU standards and deserves recognition for their efforts to defend European values.</p>  <p>  However, we are mindful that there is a clear distinction between the response to the situation in Ukraine and applications from Moldova and Georgia. There remains much to be done on crucial reforms in Georgia. I also note that Ukraine FM Kuleba specifically asked at the 4 March FAC that the three countries not be treated as a package.</p>  <p>  On 10 March the European Council invited the Commission to submit its opinions on each of the three applications and to assess the applicant states' preparedness for accession.</p>  <p>  The assessment of Georgia's application will be based on a number of criteria, primarily Georgia's capacity to align with the EU acquis.  In the past, it has taken up to three years for the Commission to revert to the Council with their opinion. Typically, the opinion will set out a number of deliverables to be fulfilled by the country before it can be considered an official candidate country. Once the opinion is accepted by the Council, the country becomes a potential candidate country (similar to both Bosnia and Kosovo), entitled to extra technical support and guidance under a stabilisation agreement, with a view to boosting the country&rsquo;s preparedness for accession.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the EU aspirations of Georgia, while urging its authorities for continued improvements, particularly in areas relating to EU values - such as the promotion and protection of human rights, the rule of law, an independent judiciary and good governance.</p></reply>

The report was published on the 9th February 2022.  </p>  <p>   The Commission undertook a significant body of work encompassing their wide-ranging terms of reference.  The report contains 69 main recommendations and together with sub recommendations, there are 130 recommendations.  The Commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  </p>  <p>  The Commission's report proposes significant changes for the Defence Forces, including to Defence Forces culture, high-level command and control structures, and for the level of Defence provision in Ireland.  Clearly, there are matters that will require careful consideration and in some critical aspects inter-departmental discussion. This includes the level of resourcing that may be allocated to Defence, legislative implications and the governance framework that will be required to underpin any changes the Government approve on foot of the Commission's report. </p>  <p>   I will also be seeking the views of my Department and the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces Representative Associations will be consulted on all matters that fall within the scope of representation, relating to the implementation of any approved plan.   I will also engage with key stakeholders and the Oireachtas, and I welcome the D&aacute;il statements on the report which took place on the 16th February.  I firmly believe that this is an opportunity to have a mature debate around the type of defence capabilities that we require and I am very much open to such a discussion.  Current events are highlighting the importance of such a debate.</p>  <p>   The intent is that following relevant consideration, and before the summer recess, I will revert to Government with a proposed response to the Commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan. This high level plan will set out proposed timelines for its implementation.  </p>  <p>  One of the Report's recommendations is that the structure of the Army be reviewed and, in that context, the disposition of Units across the Defence Forces may be considered. As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculative discussion on this matter prior to completion of the ongoing process, Government approval of any proposed plan of action, and completion of any subsequent reviews that may ensue.</p></reply>

In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.</p>  <p>  The Department additionally consults with school patron bodies in order to identify areas with pressures on enrolments.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the  capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  In addition to ongoing demographic analyses, the Department continues to liaise with Local Authorities in respect of potential longer-term requirements for educational provision across the country, through the review of the County Development Plans, preparation of Local Area Plans and other relevant statutory planning processes.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required. The patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage as well as language of instruction, i.e. Irish or English, of new schools. Parental preferences, as well as other considerations such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area (including Irish-medium provision), are key to the decision-making process and to whether at post-primary level a school would take the form of an Irish-medium Gaelchol&aacute;iste or whether, if English-medium, the school would include an Irish-medium unit or &ldquo;Aonad&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Most new post-primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of 600 &ndash; 1,000 students.  A lower threshold of 400 students may apply to Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, having regard to the alternative of establishing an Aonad within a school.</p>  <p>  While it is expected that the existing Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; in the South Dublin area between them have sufficient school places to accommodate the level of demand identified as part of the recent patronage processes in the short term, given the number of new gaelscoileanna which have opened in recent years or are planned to open in this area, my Department is keeping the position under active review as these schools grow and the number of sixth class pupils in gaelscoileanna increases.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</p><p>- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</p><p>- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</p><p>- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools.  </p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020 has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020 are available on the Gov.ie website. www.gov.ie/en/circulars/?organisation=department-of-education.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.

The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day to day running costs including heating, lighting etc. and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. These grants may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.</p>  <p>My Department has also ensured that centrally negotiated rates are available to schools for electricity and bulk heating fuels. These rates are available through existing frameworks sourced by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP). OGP has run competitions specifically for Schools at a national level and the Schools Procurement Unit and the Department has communicated with schools and school management bodies informing them of the options available to them through these national arrangements. Information on how to avail of these arrangements is available via the Schools Procurement Unit website, www.spu.ie.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.</p>  <p>  All new technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements. Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie, which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p>  <p>  In the interest of sustainability, it is critical that renewable applications are properly suited to the schools needs so as to reduce energy costs and carbon and not just applied for the sake of having renewables. It is also critical that we minimise the demand for energy before we invest in renewable energy applications. This has been assisted in previous years with the wall and attic insulation programme and the water conservation programme.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.</p>  <p>  This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.  </p>  <p>  The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.</p>  <p>The Energy in Education website portal and advice programme (Joint programme between SEAI and Dept. of  Education) also assists schools reduce their energy consumption and empowers participating schools and pupils to learn the benefits of sustainability. www.energyineducation.ie. Typically savings of between 5 to 10% are identified through low and no cost measures, while some schools participating have identified potential savings of up to 15 % or more.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the School Transport Schemes children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  As part of measures recently announced by Government to reduce the cost of living, for the 2022/2023 school year the annual school transport that the maximum amount payable per family will be reduced from the current amount of &euro;220 to &euro;150 per family at primary level and from &euro;650 to &euro;500 per family at post-primary level. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  </p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures in the current school year for transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and have applied and paid on time.   </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is currently underway.  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.  </p></reply>

Department officials also held discussions with unions representing CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors to implement this 2008 Labour Court recommendation. </p>  <p>  These discussions were held on the clear agreement of all involved that they related solely to those parties who were the subject of the 2008 Labour Court recommendation, namely CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors, and that any agreement reached on the proposal arising from these discussions would apply only to those parties.  </p>  <p>  Agreement was reached in December 2021 between the Department of Social Protection and unions representing CE supervisors and assistant supervisors that resolves this long-standing issue through the payment of a once off ex-gratia payment rather than a pension to eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  On the 23rd December, both unions involved confirmed acceptance of this settlement which will benefit over 2,200 people employed by CE schemes going back to 2008. It is estimated to have a total cost of over &euro;24 million.</p>  <p>  Generally, under the terms of this settlement, on reaching retirement age, eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex-gratia payment in respect of time employed by CE schemes since 2008.  People who retired since 2008 and who have reached retirement age will be able to apply for payments immediately when the scheme is in place. </p>  <p>  The qualifying period for the scheme is from 1st July 2008 to the 31st December 2023 and will apply to all periods of employment as a CE supervisor or CE assistant supervisor during that period subject to certain conditions.

However, following the onset of the pandemic, the CSO&rsquo;s &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; monthly youth unemployment rate &ndash; which included all those in receipt of the PUP &ndash; increased dramatically, peaking at almost 70 percent in May 2020.</p>  <p>  Following the phased reopening of the economy over the latter half of 2021, most young people closed their PUP claims and returned to work, with the CSO estimating that there were approximately 307,000 young people in employment by Q4 2021 &ndash; significantly more than before the pandemic. This recovery resulted in a sharp downward trend in youth unemployment rates.</p>  <p>  While a slight increase was observed in the &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; measure of youth unemployment in December and January following the temporary reintroduction of public health restrictions, it has since begun to fall again. February figures indicate the standard youth unemployment rate is 11.1 percent and the &lsquo;COVID-19 adjusted&rsquo; measure is 12.7 percent.  This will continue to be monitored closely.</p>  <p>  While it is welcome that the youth unemployment rate has reduced and returned to pre-pandemic levels, it is critical to continue to minimise potential scarring effects amongst young people who permanently lost their jobs during the pandemic, and to support young people who face difficulties or higher barriers to entry to the labour market.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, my Department has a series of targeted employment supports under Pathways to Work 2021-2025, the Government&rsquo;s employment services strategy. These include expanding the JobsPlus scheme and enhancing the incentive to recruit young jobseekers by increasing the youth age limit from 25 to 30 years, and ring-fencing places on the Work Placement Experience Programme, Community Employment and T&uacute;s schemes for eligible young people.</p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with the Further Education and Training sector to provide access to training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities. These are likely to be of particular relevance to young people seeking to enter the labour market for the first time. </p></reply>

A person is required to have a minimum of 520 paid reckonable PRSI contributions in order to qualify for the State Pension (Contributory).  As the actuarial value of the State Pension is currently estimated at approximately &euro;380,000, it is reasonable to require people claiming a contributory pension to have made at least 10 years of paid contributions over the term of their working life. </p>  <p>  Where a person enters the social insurance system over the age of 56 they will not be able to make sufficient social insurance contributions to be awarded a State Pension (Contributory) on reaching 66 years of age because it has a minimum contribution requirement of 520 contributions (i.e. 10 years).  In such cases a level of social insurance refund may be applicable.</p>  <p>  Subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory) also being satisfied, the State pension system already provides significant recognition to those whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, often to raise families or in a full-time caring role.</p>  <p>  This is provided through the award of credits and/or the application of the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme (under the Yearly Average method for payment calculation) and/or the application of HomeCaring Periods (under the Aggregated Contribution Method, also known as the interim Total Contributions Approach). </p>  <p>  Details of these are &ndash; </p>  <p>  - Credits &ndash; PRSI Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit) where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.</p>  <p>  - The Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme - The scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State Pension (Contributory).  The Scheme, which allows periods caring for children or people with a caring need to be disregarded (from 1994), can have the effect of increasing a person's Yearly Average.</p>  <p>  - HomeCaring Periods &ndash; HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a paid or credited social insurance contribution (regardless of when they occurred) to a maximum of 20 years.  HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Aggregated Contribution Method (also known as the Interim Total Contributions Approach) of pension calculation. </p>  <p>  Since April 2019, all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and the interim Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.  The elements which make up each method are set out in legislation. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy the conditionality to qualify for State Pension (Contributory), s/he may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) is paid, generally, where a pensioner has an adult dependent (e.g. a spouse, civil partner or cohabitant who is financially dependent upon him/her), who does not have enough contributions to claim a maximum rate State Pension (Contributory) in his/her own right. The payment rate for the IQA is up to 90% of a full contributory pension.  The most advantageous payment for a pensioner will depend upon their individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, in fulfilment of a Programme for Government commitment.  The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  Once it completed its work and fulfilled its obligations, the Commission was dissolved.  The Commission's Report was published on 7th October 2021.  The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.   </p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard - including the full transition to a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) model, phasing out of the Yearly Average approach, allowing a person to continue paying PRSI contributions past State Pension Age to improve their social insurance record for State Pension (Contributory) purposes and measures to enhance pension provision for long-term carers (in excess of 20 years). </p>  <p>  The Government agreed in October 2021 that the Commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations would be referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and also to the Commission on Taxation and Welfare for its views.  The Committee published its views on the 2nd February 2022 and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare submitted its comments on the PRSI related recommendations at the end of February.  The various views will be considered carefully as part of the Government&rsquo;s deliberations over the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are currently examining each of the recommendations and are consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions on any specific recommendation.  In this regard, I intend to bring a holistic recommended response and implementation plan to Government in April.  </p>  <p>  As the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland, the State Pension is very effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This report stated that there were 449,442 recipients of the State Pension (Contributory) at the end of 2020, a rise of 18,218 (or 4.2%) compared to the previous year.  It also showed an increase of 152,447 (51.3%) in State Pension (Contributory) recipients in the 9 years since 2011.  Please see the table below for more information on the number of State Pension (Contributory) recipients and beneficiaries for 2011 to 2020.</p><p>The number of State Pension (Contributory) recipients continued to increase during 2021.  My Department&rsquo;s administrative records indicate that there were 468,734 recipients at the end of 2021.  It is clear from my Department&rsquo;s statistics and records that the number of State Pension (Contributory) recipients has increased significantly over the past decade.  </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s report was published on the 7th October 2021.The Commission&rsquo;s Report established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed. It set out a wide range of recommendations including enhanced pension provision for long-term carers, gradual increases to the State Pension Age, aligning retirement ages in employment contracts with the State Pension Age, PRSI base broadening measures, and allowing a person to continue paying PRSI contributions past State Pension Age to improve their social insurance record for State Pension (Contributory) purposes.</p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, infographics and submissions made to the Pensions Commission are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.</p><p>The Commission carefully considered the scale of the fiscal sustainability challenge facing the State Pension system and the Social Insurance Fund, based on analysis from a range of sources, including the Department of Finance and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, demographic projections from the Central Statistics Office, and material from the Commission&rsquo;s public consultation process.  KPMG updated the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund (published in 2017) in order to have up-to-date projections of shortfalls in the Social Insurance Fund. </p><p>The Commission and its Technical Sub-Committee analyses indicate that:</p><p>- The number of working age people is projected to increase by 9% from 2021 to 2051 &ndash; increasing from 3,243,500 to 3,549,700. The number of people aged 65+ is projected to double from 2021 to 2051 &ndash; from 743,100 to 1,562,500 (CSO).  Demographic projections show that the coming decades will be marked by a transition towards a much older population structure.  Accordingly, Ireland&rsquo;s population is ageing.  </p><p>- Thankfully, people are living for longer and are healthier than previous generations.  A man aged 65 has a life expectancy of 18.3 years, while a woman aged 65 has a life expectancy of 21 years (CSO figures for 2016).  Life expectancy has increased by approximately 5 years in the last two decades and is expected to increase by a further 3 years in the next two decades to 21.9 years for a man aged 65 and 24 years for a woman aged 65 by 2041.  This shows that the duration of State Pension payments has been increasing steadily over time and is projected to increase further.</p><p>- The ratio of the working age population to the older population is also projected to change.  In 1991, there were 5 working age people for every pensioner.  At the moment, this ratio is about 4.5 working age people to every pensioner.  By 2031, this is projected to fall to 3.5 working age people to every pensioner and by 2051, to 2.3 working age people to every pensioner.  The projections show that there will be a relatively smaller proportion of working age people in the coming decades financing State Pension payments for an increasing number of pensioners.</p><p>These projected demographic changes indicate significant increases in the number of future State Pension (Contributory) recipients which will impact on State Pension related expenditure.  Analysis carried out by KPMG for the Pensions Commission projected that, on a no policy change basis, the Social Insurance Fund will have an annual deficit of &euro;2.3 billion by 2030.  This will increase to reach &euro;13.4 billion annually by 2050 and &euro;21.1 billion by 2071.  KPMG also found that by 2045, expenditure on the State Pension (Contributory) alone will exceed projected Social Insurance Fund income. </p><p>In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, this Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  The views of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will be considered as part of the Government&rsquo;s deliberations over the coming weeks.  My officials are also examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions on any recommendations.  I will be bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government in April. </p><p>It would be a strategic risk not to plan and provide for projected demographic changes, not least in terms of income adequacy for older people.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is very effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government announced a package of measures in February, which will have a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.  This package will cost in excess of half a billion euro.</p>  <p>  As part of that package, measures introduced include an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment which was paid last week at a cost of approximately &euro;49 million.  This, in addition to the &euro;5 weekly Fuel Allowance increase introduced as part of Budget 2022, means that low-income households will see an increase of 41% in Fuel Allowance support provided to qualifying households during this Fuel Allowance season compared to last season.  </p>  <p>  When added to the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment of &euro;200, which will be paid to each household in April, the combined value is &euro;325, which is the equivalent of just under ten weeks of Fuel Allowance payment.</p>  <p>  The increase of &euro;10 to the weekly income threshold of the Working Family Payment is also being brought forward.  This measure will now take effect from early April 2022 rather than from June. </p>  <p>  These measures are in addition to those introduced as part of Budget 2022, which included the largest social welfare Budget package in 14 years.  In January, around 1.4 million people received a &euro;5 increase in weekly payments, and more if they have dependents.</p>  <p>  In addition to improvements in core social welfare rates, there were a number of targeted measures designed to protect the most vulnerable from poverty.

The process to attribute contributions to employed contributors who were entitled to and in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment in 2021 is scheduled to be undertaken in the coming months. The matter of the attribution of contributions in respect of self-employed contributors for the 2021 contribution year will be considered, taking account of the matters set out in the underpinning legislation, towards the end of this year.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This benefit covers five weeks' paid leave from employment/self-employment for each parent within the first two years of the child&rsquo;s life or adoption, which can be taken as either consecutive weeks or in one-week blocks in order to provide the family with full flexibility.  This benefit is in addition to existing maternity, adoptive and paternity benefit entitlements. </p>  <p>  Provision was made in Budget 2022 to increase the number of weeks of Parents Leave and Benefit available to eligible parents from five weeks to seven weeks with effect from July 2022. The additional two weeks leave and benefit will apply to parents of children who are under age two years in July 2022 (or adoptive children who have been with their parents for less than two years at that point).  </p>  <p>  An application for Parents Benefit can be submitted either in paper format or via MyWefare depending on the individual&rsquo;s preference.</p>  <p>  Parents Benefit is one of the many schemes the Department has made available via our online platform and our rationale for doing so was to meet growing customer demand and expectations.  The Department is committed to inclusive design, enabling online portals which can be used by all users including those who may have cognitive or physical impairments, such as blindness.  This means that our sites, including MyWelfare.ie, can be used with assistive technologies such as screen readers or by using a keyboard for navigation, but also that the design of our sites supports cognitive and visual impairments such as dyslexia, colour blindness or those short of sight, to ensure that for all users there is a smooth journey and experience through our online portals.   </p>  <p>  In order to access the Department&rsquo;s services via MyWelfare a customer must complete the SAFE registration process, this is the process through which a person satisfies the Minister as to their identity.  Once their identity is verified in this way, they are issued with a Public Services Card which can be used as proof of their identity when dealing with many public service bodies.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to promote and increase awareness on the availability of the online claim method through MyWelfare, highlighting the availability of services and the potential for a decision within minutes where all conditions are fulfilled. Approximately 75% of all Parents Benefit claims are made online and over 80% of those which fulfil all eligibility conditions are auto awarded within minutes. </p>  <p>  As with any of the Department&rsquo;s schemes, if a customer does not wish to avail of the online service available a paper application form is available on request by contacting the Parents Benefit section directly. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

My Department has undertaken detailed analysis of providers' operating costs and has in-depth understanding of the cost breakdown and cost drivers of ELC and SAC delivery.  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I was pleased to announce that Government's allocation for investment in ELC and SAC this year is &euro;716 million.</p>  <p>  From September 2022, a major new funding stream - Core Funding - will be introduced. Under the new funding stream, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase, providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures. </p>  <p>  In a full year, &euro;221 million will be available for providers under this new funding stream, allocated to services based on the capacity they indicate they will offer and the qualifications of those working in a service. </p>  <p>  &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million will be distributed based on the capacity that the service is offering to provide (child places, age groups, hours and weeks). This includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff/time (&euro;25 million), and for a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million).The remaining &euro;38 million will be distributed in line with ELC graduate qualifications of ELC Lead Educators and Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 also announced that the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) would continue to be available to the ELC and SAC sector. Employers in the sector have been entitled to access the EWSS, with an exemption from the requirement to demonstrate the 30% drop in turnover that applies to other sectors since August 2020. Between October 2020 and January 2022, the enhanced rate of EWSS equalled &euro;34 million per month for ELC and SAC employers, covering, on average, 80% staff costs or 50% total operating costs. From 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week applied; amounting to &euro;22 million per month for ELC and SAC employers, covering, on average, 50% staff costs or 38% total operating costs. For March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022; this amounts of &euro;11 million per month in the sector, and will cover, on average, 25% staff costs or 11% total operating costs.</p>  <p>  Between the end of the EWSS and the introduction of Core Funding, a Transition Fund will be in place to support providers. The main conditionality of access to the Transition Fund will be that services do not increase the fees charged to parents above September 2021 levels. The sum paid to each service under the Transition Fund will depend on the service&rsquo;s capacity, location, and service type.</p>  <p>  Where providers require further financial assistance in addition to current supports available, the Department operates a ‎‎Sustainability Fund for providers experiencing sustainability challenges Providers facing these challenges should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee.</p></reply>

This process will encompass a robust review of present redress mechanisms for breaches of rights under the UNCRPD.

This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:</p>  <p>  (1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.</p>  <p>  (2) New Capacity: Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.</p>  <p>  In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.</p>  <p>  (3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Further information on the Department&rsquo;s NDP allocation and the application process will be communicated to the sector in the near future. The Department advises the services to contact their local County Childcare Committees, who will provide information on future capital supports when it becomes available. </p></reply>

On 14th March 2022 I published the report which sets out 17 numbered recommendations.   </p>  <p>  Recommendations 8- 12 relate to creating a Specialist Tracing Service that would take a two-pronged approach to identifying further cases of illegal birth registration. Firstly, it recommends a review and trace of the files flagged by Tusla as raising suspicions of illegal birth registration, but which fell short of the amount of evidence in the St. Patrick Guild files during the Independent Review. Secondly, it recommends creating a right of expedited review for persons who hold reasonable suspicions that they may have been the subject of an illegal birth registration. </p>  <p>  On the first point relating to files which were flagged as suspicious, and where the person concerned has not sought information or a review of their case, I will request that Tusla undertake a review of these files to identify which ones have markers which are indicative of potential illegal birth registration and to establish if any of these cases can be confirmed.  Where confirmed, affected individuals will be informed of this in an ethical, sensitive and fully supported manner.  I will provide the relevant legal underpinning for this review through the Birth Information and Tracing Bill and prior to issuing a formal request to Tusla.  </p>  <p>  On the second point, I will ensure that the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 will provide that a person who suspects that their birth was illegally registered will have the right to request an expedited review of their case. </p></reply>

We asked the Government to note Tusla&rsquo;s Review, which presents recommendations on the future configuration of accommodation and services that are required to meet the needs of victims of DSGBV.</p>  <p>  In September 2021, Tusla gave a presentation to all stakeholders attending the Monitoring Committee for the Second National Strategy on DSGBV, with a view to achieving a national consensus within the sector on the proposed response to these needs. </p>  <p>  Towards the end of 2021, i had a number of discussions with Minister McEntee with regard to issues relating to the publication of the Review and associated matters linked to the forthcoming 3rd national strategy on DSGBV. I also wrote to the Minister for Housing, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Social Protection to make them aware of the Review. I asked them to consider its findings when taking broader Government decisions towards the development of the 3rd national strategy. </p>  <p>  In February 2022, the Minister for Justice and I jointly submitted a memorandum to the Government on the publication of Tusla's Review. We requested the Government to note that the Programme for Government commits to implement a plan for future refuge space and recommends an approach to address this with immediate, medium and long term actions. We jointly issued a statement on the publication of the review.</p>  <p>  A High Level Interdepartmental Group (IDG), as recommended by the Review, has been established to explore issues around refuge provision and service expansion.</p>  <p>  The IDG is chaired by the Department of Justice, with members from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Tusla. This Group is reviewing the current system for provision of refuge spaces, engaging with the sector and looking at ways to expedite delivery of refuge spaces.</p></reply>

The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target a person's assets, wherever situated, which derive, or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. Since its inception, the Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction and disrupting the activities of criminal gangs by depriving them of ill-gotten assets.</p>  <p>  The Bureau is widely regarded as a best practice model in the context of combating organised crime.  It works closely with law enforcement bodies at national and international levels and continues to relentlessly pursue the illicit proceeds of organised crime activity. The actions of the Bureau send a strong message to criminals and to local communities that profiting from crime will not be tolerated.   </p>  <p>  The Criminal Assets Bureau Strategic Plan for 2020 &ndash; 2023 describes the structure of CAB and its key programmes of activity to deliver its remit. CAB has trained a nationwide network of Asset Profilers to identify assets acquired from the proceeds of criminal conduct. The Bureau continues to develop specialist expertise and technology to trace and investigate these assets. It also continues to work closely with international crime investigation agencies, and has successfully targeted proceeds of foreign criminality from countries such as the US and the UK.</p>  <p>  There are 552 trained Divisional Asset Profilers which comprise of 527 Garda&iacute;, 17 Revenue &amp;amp; Customs and 8 Social Protection Divisional Asset Profilers operating nationwide.</p>  <p>  I am advised that during 2021, the Criminal Assets Bureau delivered online training to an additional 100 Garda&iacute;.  A further training course to an additional 30 Garda&iacute; is scheduled to take place on 24 March 2022.  </p></reply>

Ireland participates in this measure, which is given legal effect under Section 60 of the International Protection Act 2015.</p><p>Those eligible for Temporary Protection (granted initially for one year, but renewable) will have immediate access to the labour market, social welfare, accommodation and other State supports as necessary. A whole-of-Government response is being mobilised to implement the practical arrangements to give effect to these commitments. </p><p>My Department is responsible for immigration controls and permissions at Dublin Airport. Immigration duties at all other airports and ports of entry to the State are the responsibility of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB). </p><p>So far, approximately 85 per cent of people who have entered the State having fled Ukraine have been welcomed at Dublin Airport. Shannon Airport currently accounts for approximately 4 per cent of all arrivals.</p><p>As a result of the large numbers of Ukrainians arriving via Dublin Airport beneficiaries of temporary protection are being provided with their permission letter on arrival in the 'one-stop-shop' established by my Department for that purpose, to ensure early access to all necessary supports. </p><p>Arrangements have also now been put in place to provide permission letters to those who arrived at Dublin Airport prior to 9 March (when permission letters started to issue) and to those who have arrived at other ports of entry to the State, including Shannon Airport. </p><p>For people who are staying in State provided accommodation, staff from my Department are visiting these accommodation locations and will provide permission letters there. </p><p>Alternatively, permission letters can be obtained by visiting the Ukraine Support Centre in Cork Street, Dublin 8. There, people can also receive assistance from the Department of Social Protection to obtain PPSN numbers, social welfare income supports, and to receive referrals to other State services. </p><p>Arrangements are also being put in place that will allow people to obtain their permission letters from the Ukraine Support Centre in Hanover Street in Cork City and from the third Support Centre that will open shortly in Limerick and is intended to serve the midwest area, including Shannon. </p><p>Further details on this will be announced shortly.</p><p>Over 5,800 temporary protection permission letters have been issued by my Department since the EU Directive was activated on 4 March. </p><p>Representatives from the Citizens Information Service are also available in the Ukraine Support Centres to help people from Ukraine with enquiries of a more general nature.  Community Welfare Officers are also present to assist with applications for financial support.  Interpretation services are available at the Centres. </p><p>Any person arriving from Ukraine can also attend any of the Department&rsquo; of Social Protection's Intreo Centres, located around the country, to register for a PPS Number and apply for income supports.  </p><p>A centralised Government information portal is available at: www.gov.ie/ukraine, which is regularly updated. My Department&rsquo;s Irish Immigration website also contains a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page, which can be viewed at: www.irishimmigration.ie/faqs-for-ukraine-nationals-and-residents-of-ukraine/.</p></reply>

The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  This payment will be made to those eligible public sector frontline healthcare staff (inclusive of agency staff working for the HSE) who worked in clinical settings (eg &ndash; and noting this list is not exhaustive: those Doctors / Nurses / Health Care Assistants / Porters / Cleaners etc. that work in clinical settings). The measure encompasses Health Care Support Assistants (also known as Home Carers / Home Help) employed by or carrying out duties contracted to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices that were affected by Covid-19. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health appreciates the levels of interest this announcement has generated. We are working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, particulars and terms and conditions that apply. Additionally, the Department and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions on this matter. This consultation is part of the Department and HSE&rsquo;s objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly.</p>  <p>  Upon conclusion of consultations with the trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars shall be published by the HSE. While the details will be finalised once this consultation has concluded, and the Department is not in a position to comment on individual cases, I trust that further clarity on the implementation of this measure will be publicly available in the very near future. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-23a.526.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032300081#WRL02700"><p>The Nursing Home Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as 'Fair Deal', is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. The primary legislation underpinning the NHSS is the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009. Participants in the NHSS contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  Funding to support people to access services in the sector continues to be provided in line with the long-established statutory mechanisms under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This is the mechanism established by the Oireachtas to provide for the processes relating to funding under the NHSS and the negotiation of prices for services for private and voluntary providers with the designated State agency, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). Accordingly, the NTPF does not discuss publicly the details of negotiations with individual nursing homes. Neither Ministers nor the Department have a role in individual price negotiations.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also provided significant specific supports to the private and voluntary nursing home sector over the course of the pandemic. As you are aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. &euro;134.5 million was made available under the scheme from March 2020 to June 2021. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing. </p>  <p>  The Department published a review of the NTPF pricing system in June 2021. This review was conducted by the NTPF with input from stakeholders and external experts. It recommended several actions to improve the pricing system. These are now being taken forward by the Department and NTPF. Given the size and scope of the NHSS, which is expected to cost the State more than &euro;1.04 billion this year, any changes must be delivered carefully and with due consideration to their impact and any unexpected consequences.</p>  <p>  The department is also taking forward the 9 recommendations of the Value for Money Review on Nursing Home Costs, which was published in December 2021. The purpose of the VFM Review was to identify, quantify and analyse the reasons for any cost differential between private/voluntary and public nursing homes and, following analysis, to make recommendations for improving the value for money obtained by the Health sector.</p></reply>

We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  Recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas.</p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years. The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with further increases planned. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the 2019 GP Agreement includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.  Work on the review is to commence this year.  The review will examine the broad range of issues affecting general practice and will set out measures necessary to deliver a sustainable service into the future.</p>  <p>  Currently, 2,542 GPs are contracted by the HSE to provide services to GMS patients. As of 1st March, 32 GMS panels (or just over 1%) are vacant, including one panel in Monaghan. This vacancy was advertised in last round, but regrettably no suitable applicant was found. The position will be advertised again shortly.  In the meantime, the HSE will continue to provide locum cover thereby ensuring a GP service will continue to be provided to the affected patients. </p></reply>

The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices (eg: nursing homes and hospices that are private, public, section 39, voluntary etc.) that were affected by Covid-19. The measure also encompasses those eligible working on site in long term residential care facilities for people with disabilities (inclusive of those facilities whether HSE or section 39). Arrangements for this sector encompassed by this measure are currently being progressed by the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  As the HSE is not the employer in these instances, the arrangements will require further analysis before finalising. It is important for the Deputy to note that eligibility will be subject to a number of factors and not solely based on individual healthcare employers / organisations. </p></reply>

Funding for specific conditions is not ring fenced. Therefore, applications in any topic area, including rare diseases, are welcome through any and all HRB grant schemes. I understand from the HRB that since 2011 the HRB has not received any applications for funding relevant to either MSD or mucopolysaccharidosis IVA mutations, with which it is associated, or indeed other lysosomal disorders via any HRB scheme. </p>  <p>  The HRB has a long track record of pro-actively supporting rare disease research collaborations. In the last 10 years alone, the HRB has invested &euro;14M in rare disease research. The HRB also funds research outside of Ireland for a number of Health Research Charities in Ireland (HRCI) projects that look at aspects of particularly rare diseases in which there is no Irish research expertise. </p>  <p>  The HRB has also recently announced funding for a Clinical Trials Network in Rare Diseases to develop and deliver a high-quality portfolio of investigator-led trials with relevance to health and social care needs in Ireland. This call was open to applications in any thematic area. The HRB approved funding of &euro;7M for seven CTNs, to enable and facilitate clinical trials. The objectives of the Clinical Trials Network-Rare Diseases are to: act as a collaborative hub for trials in rare diseases, facilitate and support the conduct of trials in rare disease and increase the opportunities for patients to access high-quality clinical trials.</p></reply>

Persons who hold a medical card or a GP visit card are not subject to any co-payments or other charges in respect of such services including GP consultations.</p>  <p>  There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services (blood tests) provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition. This has been advised to GPs by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The issue of GPs charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services is complex given the numerous reasons and circumstances under which blood tests are taken. My Department and the HSE discussed this issue previously with the relevant GP representative body.  However, it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances. It is intended to raise this issue again at an appropriate time.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the GP chronic disease management programme involves the ongoing monitoring of a patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  Where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP.</p>  <p>  However, the GMS contract stipulates that fees in respect of certain medical certificates which may be required, for example, "under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences" are not covered by the contract. Any fees charged by GPs for services provided outside the terms of the GMS contract are a matter of private contract between the GP and their patient.</p></reply>

We are working together with the HSE to provide additional details on this measure including full eligibility criteria, communications, and terms and conditions that apply. </p><p>Upon conclusion of ongoing consultations with the relevant trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars shall be published by the HSE. While the details will be finalised once this consultation has concluded, and the Department is not in a position to comment on individual cases, I trust that further clarity on the implementation of this measure will be publicly available in the very near future.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.</p>  <p>  My Department has asked the National Immunisation Advisory Committee to consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to: </p>  <p>  - girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and </p>  <p>  - women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.</p>  <p>  If NIAC conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.</p></reply>

As you may be aware Project Woodland was launched in February, 2021 and aims to improve the forestry licensing system as well as developing a shared vision for woodland creation in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The regulatory review is assessing the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework. The  review is also considering the issue of a single consent system and statutory timelines. That report is currently being finalised and will be published in a number of weeks.</p>  <p>As regards the licensing system we have set out our priorities for 2022 in our Licensing Plan which may be found at www.gov.ie/en/publication/forestry-policy-and-strategy/#forestry-licensing-plan-2022.  The Plan contains a target of 5,250 licences issues, which is a year-on-year increase of 30% on 2021 and our output to date, as shown on the weekly forestry dashboard, is in line with that target. </p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, my priority this year is to deliver on the ambition outlined in the Licensing Plan and  I would ask that all who are interested in forestry play their part in communicating the multi-functional benefits of forestry and especially to focus on encouraging  planting as a complementary activity to farming.</p></reply>

The scheme was subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1132. BEAM was funded by a combination of &euro;50 million EU exceptional aid and &euro;27.8 million Exchequer support and was provided in light of the difficult circumstances that Irish beef farmers had been facing as a result of market volatility and uncertainty in 2019.</p>  <p>  Under the scheme, aid was paid on adult cattle slaughtered between 24 September 2018 and 12 May 2019, at a rate of &euro;100 per animal subject to a maximum of 100 finished animals per herd.  Aid was also paid on suckler cows that calved in 2018, at a rate of &euro;40 per animal subject to a maximum of 40 sucklers per herd. </p>  <p>Applications for BEAM were accepted from the 19 August 2019 with the deadline for applications extended to midnight on 20   September 2019.</p>  <p>  Payments under BEAM commenced in December 2019. Payments totalling &euro;77.86m issued to 33,478 participants under the scheme. </p>  <p>  One of the conditions under which funding was granted by the EU was that there had to be an element of re-structuring built into the scheme as set out in Article 1 (3) of EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1132. Accordingly, in applying for BEAM, participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2021 as compared with the period 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019. There was also a significant cohort of eligible farmers that chose not to apply to the scheme, on the basis they did not want to comply with the conditions. </p>  <p>  Following engagement with the EU Commission regarding flexibility around the deadline for meeting the 5% reduction, I introduced an option for farmers to choose an alternative reduction period of 1 January 2021 - 31 December 2021. This was to give farmers every chance of meeting the requirements of the scheme. Some 16,000 farmers opted for this deferred reduction period before applications for deferment closed on 21 June 2021.</p>  <p>  In September 2021, following the ending of the original reduction period on 30 June 2021, it was identified that some 19,000 participants had met the scheme commitments set out in section 7.0 of the BEAM Terms and Conditions and thus exited the scheme successfully without recoupment.</p>  <p>  Approximately 5,300 of the 16,000 who opted to defer subsequently met all their BEAM commitments within the allotted timeframe, including the 5% bovine nitrates reduction in the original reduction period.  My Department therefore, removed them from the later reduction period.</p>  <p>  A further 3,627 participants who had not opted to defer did not meet some or all of the scheme commitments set out in section 7.0 of the BEAM Terms and Conditions. The total value of these overpayments was &euro;5,277,820 with &euro;3,377,804.80 returning to the EU and &euro;1,900,015.20 returning to the Exchequer in line with the ratio under which they were initially paid. </p>  <p>  A total of 234 of the 3,627 participants recorded a Nitrates reduction of between 4% and 5% which resulted in between a 20% and 80% recoupment as provided for the in the scheme Terms and Conditions. The total value of these partial recoupments was &euro;168,560.</p>  <p>  This left approximately 10,300 BEAM participants in the deferred reduction period.</p>  <p>  In March 2022, following the ending of the deferred reduction period on 31 December 2021, it was identified just over 2,800 had met their scheme commitments set out in section 7.0 of the BEAM Terms and Conditions and they exited the scheme successfully. </p>  <p>  This left 7,470 participants who did not meet some or all of the scheme commitments necessary to avoid a recoupment of some or all of their payments under the scheme. The total value of these recoupments was &euro;12,596,536 with &euro;8,061,783.04 returning to the EU and &euro;4,534,752.96 returning to the Exchequer in line with the ratio under which they were initially paid. </p>  <p>  282 of the 7,470  participants recorded a Nitrates reduction of between 4% and 5% which resulted in between an 20% and 80% recoupment as provided for the in the scheme Terms and Conditions. The total value of these partial recoupments was &euro;287,976.</p>  <p>  Overall, almost 22,000 of the 33,000 in the BEAM scheme have met the scheme commitments and they exited the scheme successfully. </p></reply>

The <b>CEP</b>ran again in 2020 and 2021 providing small capital grants to community groups to enhance their facilities and towards the reopening of facilities.  </p><p>In November 2021 the &euro;9m <b>Community Activities Fund</b>was launched and it continues into 2022 to support community groups impacted by COVID-19.  This fund will support groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with their running/operating costs such as utility or insurance bills, as well as with improvements to their facilities.  Men's and Women's Sheds are free to apply for this funding via their LCDCs, and should contact them directly to submit an application. </p><p>Funding for projects may also be available through the <b>LEADER Transitional programme</b>.  This will cover the period 2021-2022, and came into effect on the 1 April 2021 for new project applications.</p><p>Since 2018 the <b>Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP)</b>has provided supports to over 200 Men&rsquo;s Sheds, with small grants totalling over &euro;98,000 awarded to 116 Men&rsquo;s Sheds.  This support is still is available from SICAP.</p><p>The <b>Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO)</b>provides multi-annual funding towards core costs of national, communityand voluntary organisations.  The current scheme runs from 1st July 2019 to 30th June 2022.  The <b>Irish Men&rsquo;s Sheds Association</b>was allocated <b>&euro;270,000</b>over the three year period of the scheme.  My Department also funded the <b>Irish Men&rsquo;s Sheds Association</b>under the <b>Stability Fund</b>in 2020, with <b>&euro;70,424</b>in current funding to support the organisation to continue to deliver services despite the challenges brought by COVID-19. </p><p>I encourage all organisations to check on www.gov.ie and to keep in touch with their local LCDC for information around funding opportunities.</p></reply>
