Currently 26% of the members of the NESC are women.  Most of the members of the NESC are appointed on the basis of nominations received from business and employer organisations, ICTU, farming and agricultural interests, the environmental sector and the community and voluntary sector.  These sectors are encouraged to reflect gender balance when making their nominations.</p><p>  Under this legislation, the Taoiseach may also appoint eight independent members.  Since March 2011, I have appointed 8 such members, comprising four women and four men, following careful consideration of the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise relevant to the functions of the Council as required by the legislation.</p><p>  The Taoiseach may also appoint 6 public servants, typically at Secretary General level, from my own Department and from the Departments of Finance, Education and Skills, Environment, Community and Local Government and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to ensure NESC's work is integrated with Government policy-making.  </p><p>  In relation to the National Statistics Board (NSB), four positions on the Board are currently filled.  Of these, one, the Chairperson, is a woman.  The three remaining members are, in accordance with legislation, an Assistant Secretary from the Department of the Taoiseach and an Assistant Secretary from the Department of Finance, and the Director General of the CSO on an <i>ex officio</i> basis. </p><p>  There are currently four unfilled positions on the Board, which will be filled shortly.  Expressions of interest were invited for positions on the NSB, these were advertised on the websites of the Department of the Taoiseach and the NSB.</p></reply>

CIVCOM plans and monitors the progress of EU civilian crisis management missions established in the framework of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).  The Committee meets twice a week.  Ireland is represented at CIVCOM by the Deputy Representative to the Political and Security Committee.</p><p>  Civilian crisis management missions (CSDP Missions) are established by the European Union, in order to prevent the initiation or renewal of conflict and to help societies or fragile states to recover from violent conflict.  Civilian operations can pursue both short-term measures to bolster peace and security as well as complementary longer-term activities to strengthen the rule of law, democracy and human rights; to build capacity within civil societies and state institutions; and generally to engender the stable conditions necessary for sustainable development to take place.  Reflecting the range of tasks undertaken by civilian peace operations, a variety of expertise is called for, in the form of: police officers; rule of law experts such as judges and prosecutors; prison officers and customs officers; diplomats; human rights experts and gender experts; and also technical experts from the military in relation to security sector reform, disarmament or as agreement observers. </p><p>  Ireland makes an active contribution to the development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy by contributing civilian personnel to EU CSDP Missions.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade currently deploys ten civilians to EU CSDP Missions in Georgia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Palestine, Djibouti and Somalia.  Two more civilians will be deployed to Missions in Afghanistan and Niger in the coming weeks.  Six members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also deployed to the CSDP Mission in Kosovo. </p></reply>

The missions were to Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  As set out in a previous reply, English is the primary language used on OSCE Missions, and knowledge of a second relevant language is usually indicated as desirable.  For all eight missions since the start of 2013, the OSCE stated that &lsquo;command of the English Language is essential and knowledge of local languages is desirable, but not essential&rsquo;.    </p><p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Election Observation Roster services both EU and OSCE-led election observation missions.  Since the start of 2013, we have provided observers for eleven EU monitoring missions.  For six of these, the observers were required to have fluency in a language other than English.   </p><p>  I regard it as important that language proficiency was one of the four criteria for the selection of roster members.  All applicants for the new roster were required to set out their language proficiency in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Arabic.  Applicants could also indicate their proficiency in other languages.  Candidates were asked to indicate their levels of proficiency, what formal study had been undertaken, and their usage of the languages.  Although language skills were not tested orally, it is important to note that the EU carries out spot checks on language proficiency among candidates nominated to take part in election observer missions.</p></reply>

The review also allows for further scope for cultivating and developing trade and investment relationships with high growth markets in Asia, South America and Africa, with the introduction of  seven &lsquo;Exploratory and High Potential Markets&rsquo; including, Turkey, Nigeria, Mexico, Vietnam, Chile, Indonesia and Thailand.  In addition, the recent announcement of the expansion of the Embassy network* is specifically designed to support greater levels of trade and inward investment.   </p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills have advised that there are a range of languages available for the Leaving Certificate in our schools.  In addition to English and Irish, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Japanese and Arabic are available.  There are also a suite of non-curricular EU languages such as Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian which students from those countries can present for in the Leaving Certificate.  There is a Chinese module available as an option for the transition year programme and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently finalising a short course in Chinese language and culture for the new Junior Cycle, following its evaluation of submissions received as an outcome of a consultation process which finished last month. </p><p>  The Government recently launched the Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) 2014, the third instalment of this plan.  Under the APJ, the Government has committed to develop and publish a languages education strategy, including foreign language education, which will support Ireland&rsquo;s ability to win business abroad and create jobs at home.  Under the oversight of the Export Trade Council, which I chair, we will continue in 2014 to boost bilateral trade and investment with emerging markets, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s key established markets. </p><p><b>*</b><b><i>Embassies</i></b><b>:</b>  Thailand (Bangkok), Indonesia (Jakarta), Croatia (Zagreb), Kenya (Nairobi) and the reopening of the Embassy in the Holy See.</p><p><b></b><b><i>Consulates General</i></b><b>: </b>  Hong Kong, Austin and Sao Paulo. <table><tr><th>-</th><th>Services Exports 2012</th><th>&euro; million</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Country</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Germany</td><td>8,032</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>France</td><td>5,593</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Italy</td><td>5,383</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Netherlands</td><td>3,902</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Japan</td><td>2,713</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Spain</td><td>2,666</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>China</td><td>2,397</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Switzerland</td><td>2,146</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Belgium</td><td>1,820</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Sweden</td><td>1,773</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Merchandise Exports 2012</th><th>&euro;000         </th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Country</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Belgium</td><td>13,618,721</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Germany</td><td>7,461,015</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Switzerland</td><td>5,070,306</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>France</td><td>4,348,405</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Netherlands</td><td>3,291,522</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Spain</td><td>2,765,850</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Italy</td><td>2,656,383</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Japan</td><td>2,084,681</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>China</td><td>1,564,942</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Sweden</td><td>803,961</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Merchandise Exports 2013</th><th>&euro;000</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Country </td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Belgium</td><td>11,220,636</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Germany</td><td>6,571,857</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Switzerland</td><td>5,115,882</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>France</td><td>4,016,437</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Netherlands</td><td>3,670,647</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Spain</td><td>2,693,463</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Italy</td><td>2,290,718</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Japan</td><td>1,692,054</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>China</td><td>1,418,175</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Sweden</td><td>822,340</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I have made it clear, including in direct talks with President Museveni, that the enactment of this draconian legislation will affect our valued relationship with Uganda.  </p><p>  This legislation is in clear conflict with Uganda&rsquo;s binding international obligations to uphold human rights.  It is in contravention of the principle of non-discrimination in the Ugandan Constitution, in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in the African Charter on Human and People&rsquo;s Rights, both of which have been ratified by Uganda.  It is the responsibility of the Ugandan Government to uphold its international obligations to treat all citizens equally, regardless of their sexual orientation.</p><p>  Ireland, together with our EU partners, has been actively engaged with the Ugandan Parliament and President Museveni in efforts to halt this regressive and discriminatory legislation since it was first proposed in 2009.  We have engaged intensively since the Bill re-entered Parliament unexpectedly in December 2013.  The new law is a threat to Uganda&rsquo;s gay community and an affront to all those who value tolerance, respect and the dignity of all people. It will also undermine public health in a very practical way, including the efforts to combat the scourge of HIV/AIDS in Uganda. </p><p>  The Government has consistently supported the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and we are strongly committed to combating all human rights violations against individuals on any basis.  Our commitments in this area are fundamental to our foreign policy and our aid programme.</p><p>  It is important to emphasise that no funding from Ireland&rsquo;s aid budget is provided by way of direct support to the Government of Uganda, with the exception of the Office of the Auditor General, for its important work on fighting corruption.  Our support to the poorest and most disadvantaged people in Uganda is provided through trusted non-Government channels.  In this way, we are directly targeting the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society, including people living with HIV/AIDS, those experiencing chronic poverty in Karamoja, and those who are being subjected to Gender Based Violence.  </p><p>  Our foreign policy approach, our aid programme and our international reputation give Ireland a strong voice, in close co-operation with other partners, on vital human rights issues.  We will continue to work internationally and in Uganda to promote human rights, including LGBTI rights, and to support human rights organisations and institutions, many of which are operating in very difficult environments.  We strongly urge the Ugandan authorities to abolish all laws that contravene human rights obligations, including this regressive new legislation.</p><p>   In working to protect and promote human rights, we also want to ensure that the poorest of the poor are not penalised for the faults of their Governments, and we will always work to find ways of delivering assistance effectively for the benefit of the poor.  </p><p>  A review of the future of Ireland&rsquo;s partnership with Uganda has been planned in the coming period, and this will provide us with the opportunity to consider what we have achieved so far, and how we should work for the benefit of the people of Uganda in the future. </p></reply>

I have repeatedly condemned attacks by both sides against civilians, and I reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s demand that the Security Council refer these criminal acts to the International Criminal Court. </p><p>  Compliance with Resolution 2139 will obviously be one of the major topics for discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 March.  I warmly welcomed the adoption of Resolution 2139 in a statement I issued on 24 February, having urged such decisive action on the Council&rsquo;s part for some time now, and emphasised that it is now critical that the terms of this binding resolution are fully implemented by all sides, and especially the Syrian authorities.</p></reply>

The regime provides for new powers to be exercised by the Central Bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions within financial service providers and of key office-holders within those providers. </p><p>  Following on from the Central Bank Reform Act, 2010, the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 enhances the Central Bank's regulatory powers, drawing on the lessons of the recent past in Ireland and abroad.  It strengthens the ability of the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.  The Act also provides the Central Bank with greater access to information and analysis and underpins the credible enforcement of Irish financial services legislation in line with international best practice. </p><p>  The reforms introduced under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 are complemented by a number of strategically important reforms at EU level in financial services. Under our presidency, agreement was reached on the single supervisory mechanism, one of the main cornerstones of Banking Union which will provide for the European Central Bank to act as supervisor for systemic important banks throughout the Union.  Agreement was also reached on the Capital Requirements package which will ensure that European banks hold enough good quality capital to withstand future economic and financial shocks. </p><p>  These legislative reforms have been supplemented by a significant increase in regulatory activity by the Central Bank with a corresponding increase in staff numbers and skill levels.  The Central Bank of Ireland's Enforcement Priorities for 2013 highlight the importance of enforcement within its risk-based regulatory framework (PRISM).  PRISM represents a challenging and proportionate risk-based system of supervision for all financial institutions operating in Ireland.  The Central Bank's Strategic Plan 2013   2015 also sets out a strategy of assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.</p><p>  In response to the Tribunal recommendations I have considered the provision of tax relief for donations to political parties and have decided against introducing such relief.  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 provided for changes to the Electoral Act, 1997 and imposed new limits for donations.  Donations to individuals exceeding &euro;600 must be declared and donations exceeding &euro;1,000 in any one year may not be accepted.  Political party donations greater than &euro;1,500 must be declared and donations greater than &euro;2,500 in any one year may not be accepted.  These limits, in themselves, should act to deter any attempts by wealthy individuals to influence political activity.</p><p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners have provided me with the following information in relation to Revenue issues raised in the recommendations of the Moriarty Tribunal.</p><p><b>  Recommendation: Independence of the Revenue Commissioners</b> - Section 101 of the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 has placed on a statutory basis the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the exercise by the Commissioners of their statutory functions under the various taxation and customs enactments.  This has given effect to the recommendation of the Report of the Tribunal into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters (that is, the report of Mr. Justice Moriarty), that the principle or convention of the independence of the Revenue Commissioners be placed on the more robust status of a legislative provision.</p><p><b>  Recommendation: Representations to Revenue by Office holders</b> - In relation to this proposal I as Minister for Finance remain of the view that this recommendation could best be considered in the context of the Government's overall approach to political and parliamentary reform.  Representations are a valid part of the political process.  The Government may wish to consider whether this recommendation should be confined to Revenue, or to Office holders, or whether the Commissioners decision to publish data on the volume of representations made by each Deputy is an adequate response.</p><p><b>  Recommendation: Transmission to other agencies of information obtained by Revenue under bilateral agreements - </b>This recommendation has been considered.  These agreements are international treaties which are very precisely drawn as to the purpose for which information may be used and would not permit such transmission.  However if opportunities arise in the future, the Commissioners will consider the matter further.  The Deputy will appreciate that Revenue is not in a position to comment on matters relating to individuals for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality. </p></reply>

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It is applied at a low rate on a wide base.  The revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.  </p><p>  As you may be aware, delivering on a commitment in the Programme for Government, the USC was reviewed by the Department of Finance in the lead up to Budget 2012. The report is available at; </p><p> </p><p>   As a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum.  It is estimated that this removed almost 330,000 individuals from the charge.   </p><p>  It should be acknowledged that Ireland has a progressive taxation system which ensures that the burden of taxation falls most heavily on those with a higher ability to pay.  The latest data from the OECD's 2013 Tax Wages Report shows that Ireland has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the developed world.  Currently it is estimated that 856,000 workers are excluded from the charge to income tax entirely.</p><p>  In keeping with normal practice I have no intention of setting out planned changes to the tax system in advance of the Budget, which is almost eight months away. However, as is also normal practice, my officials will model and examine potential options for changes to the tax system for my consideration as part of the overall Budget package.   </p></reply>

Phased payments by deduction at source from salary, occupational pension or certain Government payments are entirely free of charge.  However, certain LPT payment options including, credit card, direct debit and cash payment through service providers are provided by either financial institutions or commercial entities and are subject to transaction fees.  Revenue has no role in regard to the setting of these fees nor does it profit in any way from their payment.</p><p>  For the Deputy's information, there are currently eight separate payment options available for LPT including, </p><p>  -  Single Debit Authority, which operates like an electronic cheque.  This option is activated by completing the payslip on the LPT Return and will not be deducted from bank accounts by Revenue any earlier than 21 March 2014 in respect of the 2014 LPT liability</p><p>  -  Debit/Credit cards.</p><p>  -  Cheque/Bank Draft/Postal Order.</p><p>  -  Cash payments (including debit/credit cards) through Revenue approved Payment Service Providers.</p><p>  -  Phased cash payment arrangements (including debit/credit cards) through Revenue approved Payment Service Providers.</p><p>  -  Deduction at source from salary or occupational pension. </p><p>  -  Deduction at source from certain payments received from the Department of Social Protection and from payments received from the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; Marine.</p><p>  -  Direct Debit, which is deducted on the 15th day of each month over the course of the year.  </p><p>   In regard to the cash payment option, the approved payment service providers are An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  These service providers were approved because they have extensive nationwide outlets and are easily accessible right across the country.  They provide liable persons with the facility to pay LPT in full or on a phased weekly/monthly basis as best suits individual circumstances.  I understand that currently, An Post charges &euro;1 per transaction; Payzone charges 75 cents per transaction for payments up to &euro;50, &euro;1 per transaction for payments between &euro;50.01 and &euro;100 and &euro;2 per transaction for payments over &euro;100; and Omnivend charges a fee of 4% per transaction.</p><p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, the person in question opted to meet his LPT liabilities through one of these approved service providers and on that basis is liable to the transaction charges as outlined.  I must again stress that Revenue has no role in the imposition of these charges. </p><p>  Again for the Deputy's information, Revenue has confirmed to me that the 'deduction at source' options as outlined above do not incur any transaction fees or additional costs and deduct the LPT liability in phased amounts across the course of the year.  If the person in question is interested in changing his preferred payment option to deduction at source, he can do so online by using his Property ID and PI number to access his details or he can contact the LPT Helpline at 1890 200255. </p></reply>

The Register was populated using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue's own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database and data from various utility companies.  The various data sets were cross-checked by Revenue to ensure the accuracy of the information in respect of each property being included on the Property Register.    </p><p>  However, given the scale of the project it was inevitable that there would be some errors and in a small number of instances properties were either duplicated to, or omitted from, the Property Register.  Revenue clearly indicated this possibility in all of its communications in regard to LPT and stressed that in such circumstances the onus was on the property owners to make contact and provide the correct details.    </p><p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, the person in question did not receive any notification in respect of either 2013 or 2014 from Revenue as the details on the Property Register did not reflect the correct postal address.  A member of the LPT team recently made direct contact with the person in question and assisted him in correcting his contact details, filing his 2013 Return and arranging his payment obligations in respect of both 2013 and 2014.  Revenue has confirmed to me that the person s details are now correctly detailed on the Property Register and that his LPT Return filing obligations are fully in order.  The person confirmed to the LPT team member that he would be paying his outstanding liabilities in the coming days by cheque.  Revenue has assured me that once the payment is received the person will be fully LPT compliant.</p></reply>

The maximum amount of interest paid in respect of this ceiling for which tax relief can be claimed is &euro;20,000 for married/widowed persons and &euro;10,000 for single persons. </p><p>  For tax year eight and subsequent tax years, the applicable ceiling changes to the reduced 'non-first time buyer ceiling', which applies at maximum rates of &euro;6,000 for married/widowed persons and &euro;3,000 for single persons. </p><p>  In regard to the specific case to which the Deputy refers, Revenue has confirmed to me that the persons in question were assigned 'first time buyer' status with effect from 1 January 2007, which entitled them to the higher ceiling relief until 31 December 2013 inclusive.  In accordance with the legislation, their entitlement to the higher relief expired with effect from 1 January 2014 at which point they became entitled to the lower 'non-first time buyer' ceiling.</p><p>  I appreciate and very much sympathise with the position of people who are experiencing genuine difficulty in meeting their mortgage payments, particularly those who purchased their homes at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008.  In this regard, in Budget 2012, I fulfilled the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the rate of mortgage interest relief to 30 per cent for first time buyers who took out their first mortgage in that period.  In the absence of this change mortgage interest relief rate would have reduced to 15% resulting in maximum relief of &euro;450 per annum.</p><p>  However, given that mortgage interest relief has now been abolished for mortgages taken out since 1st January 2013, I do not propose to revisit the legislation with a view to introducing further changes.</p></reply>

(3A).  Despite subsection (3)(a), the Financial Services Ombudsman may accept a complaint against a regulated financial service provider who has begun legal proceedings in relation to a matter to which the complaint relates, but only if that Ombudsman reasonably suspects that the regulated financial service provider has begun those proceedings in order to prevent the making of the complaint, or to frustrate or delay its investigation. </p><p>  The FSO is of the view that there is nothing in the applicable legislation to prevent a financial service provider from issuing legal proceedings whilst a complaint is being dealt with by the FSO. It is the general view of the FSO that, in relation to complaints about a product that is still active, the terms and conditions relative to that product will continue to be applicable while the complaint is being investigated by the FSO. The contractual legal terms between the financial service provider and the complainant in relation to an active product continue to apply   for example, loan repayments still have to be met. Conversely the legal rights of a provider to enforce its rights under the contract also continue to apply whilst the complaint is being investigated by the FSO. </p><p>  Where a complaint has been made to the FSO and a financial services provider subsequently issues legal proceedings whilst the complaint is being dealt with by the FSO, the FSO will make a determination as to his jurisdiction to continue with the investigation of the complaint, taking into account the above factors under Section 57BX (3) &amp;amp; (3A) in addition to the FSO's general discretion under two other sections of the Act: Section BX(2) of the Act which provides inter alia that the Financial Services Ombudsman has sole responsibility for deciding whether a complaint is within his jurisdiction and; Section 57BZ of the Act which provides: &quot;(1) Without limiting section 57BY, the Financial Services Ombudsman can decide not to investigate a complaint, or to discontinue an investigation of a complaint, on the ground that - .... (d) there is or was available to the complainant an alternative and satisfactory means of redress in relation to the conduct complained of, &quot;.</p><p>  In circumstances where, in the opinion of the FSO, issues between the parties are more appropriately dealt with by a court in legal proceedings, the FSO may in the exercise of his discretion under these sections determine not to investigate or to continue to investigate a complaint on the ground that there is an alternative and satisfactory means of redress in relation to the conduct complained of. I am informed by the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau that in each case where legal proceedings are issued, the FSO reviews that case on an individual basis, taking into account the particular circumstances of the case and taking into account the statutory provisions and criteria as outlined above and within the context of the legal powers available to the FSO. I am also informed by the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau that the issuing of legal proceedings by a financial services provider does not automatically lead to the FSO ceasing investigation of that complaint.   </p></reply>

NAMA s cost of funds derives from both the interest cost on its debt securities (senior and subordinated) and its interest rate hedging cost. NAMA has entered into interest rate hedging which acts as an insurance mechanism to hedge its interest expense against interest rate increases over its lifetime. NAMA s cost of funds will vary over its lifetime, depending on the mix of its liability base, the associated costs of these liabilities and its hedging strategy. </p></reply>

Accordingly, the law firm Matheson was engaged by the NTMA to:</p><p>  (i)  advise on market norms in the private sector in terms of notice periods and post-termination restrictions;</p><p>  (ii)  assess the adequacy of the protections in the current NTMA employment contracts/codes of conduct where   employees leave the NTMA to join a commercial entity in the private sector that might gain an unfair advantage by employing them;  and</p><p>  (iii)  recommend changes that could be made in this area by the NTMA.This review applied across all the NTMA's business areas, including NAMA. All NAMA staff are employees of the NTMA and under Section 42 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, 2009 the NTMA assigns staff to NAMA. Other than a small number of staff reassigned from other functions within the NTMA, NAMA staff are employed on the basis of specified purpose contracts   their employment lasts for as long as NAMA requires their particular function. </p><p>  Matheson's principal recommendations were as follows:</p><p>  -  longer notice periods of 3 to 6 months to be introduced for middle and senior NTMA management employees.</p><p>  -  garden leave provisions to be included in all NTMA employment contracts. </p><p>  -  post-termination of employment restrictions (including cooling-off periods and non-solicitation of employees) to be considered on a case-by-case basis in respect of senior NTMA management employees in particular. However, Matheson stressed that the imposition of such restrictions would need to be balanced against the NTMA's need to recruit good candidates for whom such restrictions may act as a significant disincentive to taking up employment with the NTMA. Furthermore, to maximise the prospects of enforceability, Matheson advised that any such restrictions would need to be drafted as narrowly as possible.</p><p>   It was proposed by Matheson that any required changes resulting from these recommendations would be introduced for new NTMA employees and for existing NTMA employees on promotion. The NTMA has accepted the Matheson proposals and is implementing them on this basis.</p><p>  With regard to staff assigned to NAMA, it should be noted that the 3 month notice period and garden leave provision were already in operation since the first persons were assigned at start of 2010.  A provision prohibiting certain activities in an employee's subsequent employment for a defined period of time has also been introduced on a case by case basis for new<b></b>  employees, in cases where employees have moved from fixed to specified purpose contracts, and on promotion. All new NAMA staff will be subject to the new provisions.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware of s202 provisions in NAMA Act which are lifelong provisions with respect to confidentiality for all current and former staff assigned to NAMA.</p></reply>

Debtors are allowed a salary out of business overheads where this is necessary to manage and preserve the value of the assets securing NAMA's loans.   NAMA advises that all overheads are reviewed as part of its regular review of each debtor's performance and developments in the wider economy. I would remind the Deputy that, as Minister for Finance, I have no role in relation to the day-to-day detail of NAMA's strategy in this area.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, as the NAMA Chief Executive has previously advised the Agency has permitted 167 principals to retain salaries out of the overheads of the business.  NAMA's analysis shows that 3 individuals managing multi-billion euro portfolios are authorised to retain income of &euro;200,000.  There are no cases in which principals have been authorised by NAMA to retain salaries in excess of &euro;200,000.                                                                                                          </p><p>   </p></reply>

In addition, where a regulated entity seeks collateral or a personal guarantee to support a lending proposition it must explain clearly the possible implications for the guarantor of giving such collateral or personal guarantee.  Any enforcement of a personal guarantee over a principal private residence must be in accordance with the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.</p><p>  An SME is entitled to apply for a review by the Credit Review Office where the borrower considers that the terms or conditions attached to a credit facility or its price are so onerous as to amount to a constructive refusal.  This could include unreasonable personal guarantees. </p><p>  Personal guarantees make the guarantor liable in the event of the SME being unable to meet its liabilities and may make the guarantor personally liable for the debts of a limited company.

No 20 of 2014) on 28th January.  This Order commenced sections 21 and 22 of the 2012 Act which provide for the appointment of an appeals officer and for the appeals process in relation to decisions of a decision maker of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board.  On the same day I made the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund (Appeals) Regulations 2014 (S.I. No 21 of 2014) which set out the procedures to be followed in appeals. </p><p>  I recently appointed Mr Pat Whelan, former Director General of the Office of the Ombudsman, to be the inaugural Appeals Officer of the Fund.  In accordance with the 2012 Act, a former resident who is dissatisfied with a decision maker's decision on their application or a person whom a decision maker decides is not a former resident within the meaning of the Act can appeal to the Appeals Officer.</p><p>  No advance has been sought from the National Treasury Management Agency investment account pursuant to section 30(3) of the 2012 Act.  The Appeals Officer will be paid for determining appeals on a per diem basis while the administrative support will be provided by my Department.  The costs of the Appeals Officer which will be met from the investment account will be dependent on the level of appeals involved.  While it is not proposed to recoup the costs of the administrative support from the investment fund at this stage, this matter will be kept under review.</p><p>  From inquiries made by my officials I understand that the Fund, which uses the service name Caranua, had received 1,914 applications at the end of February.  The first part of the application process is to verify that an applicant is actually eligible to apply.  At end February 501 applicants had been confirmed to be eligible.  Once confirmed as eligible applicants are then appointed an adviser.  The role of the adviser is to provide assistance in the making of an application for services.  Advisers have been appointed for 64 applicants and 4 applications have been approved.  No applications have been rejected. </p></reply>

Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school, and it is the Board of Management which employs the Principal at the school.  The schools Board of Management is accountable to the schools Patron.</p><p>  Neither I nor officials of the Department have powers to investigate individual complaints, except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.  Accordingly, whereas the Department provides funding and policy direction for schools, the Department does not have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course of direction with regard to individual complaint cases. </p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints relating to the actions or non-actions of a school recognised by the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school's complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the actions or non-actions </p><p>of a school has, or may have, adversely affected the child.  The office can be contacted at: Ombudsman for Children's Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin 1; tel. 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 865 6800 or email (oco@oco.ie).</p><p>  Part 5 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 makes provision for the Council to conduct inquiries into a teacher's Fitness to Teach.  I intend to commence Part 5 later this year.  Government approval was given on 10th December for drafting The Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill to provide for a wider range of sanctions such as advice, admonishment and censure, which may be applied by the Council following an inquiry.</p><p>  The Deputy may also be aware that procedures were introduced in 2009 under the Education Act (Section 24) for schools and Education and Training Boards (then VECs), as employers, to address teacher competence issues.  Generally speaking it will be necessary for these procedures to be exhausted before investigation by the Teaching Council under Part 5. </p><p>  I am satisfied that robust external inspection arrangements are in place that predominantly focus on evaluating the quality of learning and teaching in schools.  The Inspectorate of my Department evaluates the organisation and operation of schools and the quality and effectiveness of the education provided in such schools.  The Inspectorate is focused on ensuring that the </p><p>learners in schools receive the best possible education in the light of their potential learning needs.  It does this by identifying and acknowledging good educational practice and providing clear, practical advice as to how the quality of education provision can be improved. </p><p>  I am committed to providing for a Parent and Student Charter. With this in mind, my Department is currently examining the legislative changes that could provide the statutory underpinning of such a charter and enable the detailed development of the charter in discussion with the relevant stakeholders, including parents and students. </p></reply>

Project Maths emphasises student understanding of mathematical concepts and the use of contexts and applications that enable students to relate Mathematics to their everyday experience.</p><p>  The curriculum has been phased in over a number of years.  In tandem with the roll-out, a comprehensive programme of professional development has been provided for teachers of mathematics by the Project Maths Development Team (PMDT).  To date, ten workshops have been offered to all maths teachers on a rolling basis as each strand of the curriculum was implemented.  The workshops have encouraged teachers to adapt teaching strategies appropriate to the various curriculum strands and to developing student skills in critical areas such as problem solving.  Teachers have also had opportunities to engage with additional CPD in the form of modular courses on areas of particular interest, for example, the use of ICT in maths teaching, as well as a national conference. </p><p>  Project Maths is also supported by the introduction of a Professional Diploma in Mathematics for Teaching to upskill out-of-field teachers of mathematics in September 2012.  The course is jointly accredited by the University of Limerick and NUI Galway.  The Professional Diploma represents an investment of over &euro;3 million to date.  There are over 600 teachers on the programme at present and a further intake is planned for September 2014.</p><p>  The need for change had been identified in a number of studies and reports conducted since 2002.  These include the Chief Examiner's Report for Mathematics (2005), the results of PISA 2009 and reports of inspections in Mathematics undertaken by the Inspectorate.  Further, the continuing decline in the uptake of higher-level Mathematics, particularly in senior cycle, meant that fundamental changes to the manner in which Mathematics was taught, learned and assessed were essential. </p><p>  More recent inspections indicate that at post-primary level, in Mathematics the quality of teaching in 77% of lessons and the quality of learning in 74% of lessons was judged to be satisfactory or better. </p><p>  The impact of Project Maths was also evaluated by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER).  The research highlights that considerable progress has been made in implementing the revised mathematics syllabuses since the inception of the Project Maths initiative in 2008.  There are numerous examples of promising practice in the way that mathematics is being delivered in the classroom, and emerging evidence of positive impacts on students' experiences of, and attitudes towards, mathematics. </p><p>  The findings include that students are positively disposed to Mathematics and have high levels of confidence in Strands 1 and 2, the strands that were the first to be introduced in the phasing-in of Project Maths.  Leaving Certificate and Junior Certificate students perform much better than their international peers in these strands.  Students report that they are frequently undertaking activities commonly associated with the revised syllabuses (for example, making connections between mathematics topics, and applying mathematics to real-life situations). However, more traditional approaches (for example, using textbooks and copying from the board) also continue to be widespread.</p><p>  The research on the impact of Project Maths on student's attitudes and attainment as well as evaluation of the situation regarding teaching and learning of mathematics in schools will be taken into account by my Department and the PMDT when designing the support plan for maths teachers for the coming years. </p></reply>

I have referred the draft proposals to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, to allow a full public discussion of the proposed legislative framework, including inputs from parents, education partners and other stakeholders. I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure the legislation strikes the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Report of the Advisory Group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism contains recommendations aimed at ensuring that Irish schools cater for the increased diversity within society. I am keen to see that schools strike the right balance to ensure that the backgrounds of all children in the local community are respected. To this end, I launched a public consultation on inclusiveness in primary schools in September 2013. I sought views on issues such as how best to accommodate students of various belief systems and traditions.  The submissions received, together with the Forum Report findings and recommendations in this area, will be considered in the preparation of a White Paper this year.</p></reply>

There is not presently a distinct disability category of Down syndrome for resource allocation purposes. As such, it is not possible to say how many pupils with Down syndrome would be reclassified as low incidence and the extent of the additional resource teaching posts which would be required to provide for this. </p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy also that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a formal role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 in advising me in relation to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities. </p><p>  My Department requested that the NCSE consider the issue of whether Down Syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability, in the context of its preparation of comprehensive advice on how the educational system supports children with special educational needs in schools. </p><p>The NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools has now been published and is available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD. </p><p>  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs. </p><p>  The NCSE has established a Working Group to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. I understand that the Working Group will report its findings before the end of spring 2014.</p></reply>

The objective of this differentiation is to ensure that resources provided to schools to support children who have additional learning needs are targeted to ensure that those children most in need benefit from these resources.</p><p>  The rationale for the differing ratios is not dictated by legislation, but is based on international literature on the incidence of disability as well as international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy which indicate that there is a greater incidence of disability/learning difficulty in boys than girls. </p><p>  The NCSE  recently published a report 'A study of the Prevalence of Special Educational Needs' which is available at www.ncse.ie and which contains details regarding the prevalence of special needs among the pupil population.  </p><p>  The criteria for the allocation of GAM hours is outlined in Circular 0007/2014, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. </p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that the NCSE report on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs has recommended that under a proposed new allocation model, all children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category. </p><p>  While there are no plans to increase the number of hours under the General Allocation Model in an all girls school, the NCSE has established a Working Group to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report.

JCT commenced the roll-out of CPD events for both school leaders and teachers in November 2013.  A range of resources and supports will also be made available online.    A variety of CPD delivery methods will be employed including in-school CPD, some of which will be teacher-led, along with off-site workshops delivered by JCT. A multifaceted approach will be adopted, which will help promote professional dialogue and sharing of experiences among school leaders and teaching staff, and support schools in focussing on their own needs and aims, thereby allowing the CPD to impact more directly on teaching and learning in each school context.  </p><p>English teachers will receive a minimum of 4.5 days of training or continuous professional development (CPD).  All other subject teachers will receive a minimum of 4 days CPD for each subject.  All schools will have the equivalent of one full day of CPD annually for each year of the roll-out of the JCSA.  Schools can close to facilitate this CPD for all teaching staff.  This will mean that for a teacher of two subjects, the total CPD received will be in the region of 16 days or its equivalent and even more for teachers of English.  Substitution cover is provided to allow teachers to engage in these activities.</p><p>The CPD being planned by the JCT also builds on the substantial amount of CPD and resources already offered to English teachers and post-primary schools' literacy link teachers over the last 2 years by the PDST, which has been leading the delivery of CPD related to the literacy and numeracy strategy.  The reforms arising from the Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, including literacy and numeracy development, school self-evaluation and junior cycle, are closely aligned and interlinked; CPD and improvements in one area should impact across the others at school level.</p><p>The supports for the new Junior Cycle, including ICT supports, are currently being discussed with the education stakeholders</p></reply>

This grant, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's existing book rental scheme.</p><p>  I want to commend all schools that have used it to help build up book rental schemes over the years and I am aware of the difficulties faced by schools in relation to these schemes. Their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents.</p><p>  At my request, the National Parents' Council surveyed the views of their members in relation to currently operating book rental schemes.</p><p>  Parents have reported that where book rental schemes operate, they are open to all parents in 95% of cases, and that the cost per child is under &euro;40 per year in a considerable majority of schools.</p><p>  Perhaps most tellingly, the survey has found that 93% of parents believe that book rental schemes help with the costs of educating a child.</p><p>  Ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents must therefore clearly be our aim.</p><p>  I understand that it feels unfair to those schools who have invested time and money to establish such schemes, that they now cannot benefit from the additional funding which was secured as part of the Budget. Of course it is unfair, but equally, the status quo was deeply unfair on many parents and I am not currently in a position to re-examine the scheme.</p><p>  The parents who had no access whatsoever to book rental schemes needed more support.</p><p>  With the limited funding available, I believe that targeting this funding - to make sure that every parent in Ireland has access to some level of a book rental scheme - was the greatest good that could be achieved.</p><p>  The Department is contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme to advise them of the application process.</p><p>  The school referred to by the Deputy indicated in the Primary School Census 2013 that they currently operate a book rental/loan scheme and will not therefore qualify for funding.</p></reply>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform undertook a thorough examination of the payment of all allowances in the public sector during 2012.  Following this review of allowances, the Government approved a number of measures relating to public service allowances for new beneficiaries.</p><p>  Subsequent to this review, the matter of allowances payable in the Education sector was the subject of an in-depth consideration by the Committee of Public Accounts (PAC) at its hearing on 24 October 2012.  All of the relevant material in respect of all allowances payable in the Education sector was provided to the Committee, as part of this examination, and I understand that this material is still available on the PAC's website.</p><p>  Secondly, there is the issue of compliance with public sector pay policy which has been raised by the Committee of Public Accounts arising from the Committee's current examination of remuneration practices in Section 38 Agencies in the Health Sector.  The Committee wrote to all Accounting Officers, including the Secretary General of my Department who is the Accounting Officer for the Education sector, to seek assurances that public sector employees are in compliance with public pay policy and the Education sector Accounting Officer will respond to this letter in due course.</p></reply>

This is primarily a matter for the riparian owners.</p><p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) with its technical consultants, is currently undertaking the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, in partnership with local authorities and other stakeholders. This is a strategic approach that recognises the need, in line with international best practice, to move to a more sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.</p><p>  The CFRAM Studies are comprehensive catchment-based studies through which, following public consultation, detailed flood maps are produced and flood risk management measures are assessed and taken to outline design. These measures will be prioritised and set out in a Flood Risk Management Plan. More information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie.</p><p>  The River Liffey is being assessed as part of the Eastern CFRAM study and the main trunk of the river from Poulaphouca down to the sea, through Dublin City, is being modelled, including a number of tributaries.  The areas of significant flood risk, described within the Programme as Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs, along the main trunk which are being assessed in detail are Newbridge, Clane, Celbridge, Leixlip, Lucan to Chapelizod, and Dublin. Under the study the flood maps are based on the conditions in the river as surveyed, and so include the existing river bed levels. Culverts, etc, are modelled as unblocked (ie clear of debris). As part of the study, it is intended to undertake a high level screening exercise to identify culverts at high potential risk of blockage by debris.  If silting, debris or vegetation are determined to be contributory factors in increased flood risk on the river then this will be considered in the risk management plan produced under the CFRAM study.  More information on the study is available on www.eastcframstudy.ie.</p><p>  In addition, the ESB has a significant role in controlling water flows and potential flooding on the River Liffey as part of its management procedures for Poulaphouca Dam. The ESB is a member of the CFRAM Programme stakeholder group and any options for flood risk management arising from the Eastern CFRAM study will have to take account of ESB operational procedures.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of these rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular suppliers on the basis of grounds that could be considered discriminatory and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p><p>  The consideration of clauses that allow for the inclusion of social and environmental clauses in public contracts is something that I have been examining. Social clauses can be used in public procurement in cases where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States. The EU procurement rules allow social considerations to be included as a contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the contract notice or in the contract documents and relate to the performance of the contract. </p><p>  In terms of the scope for including such clauses, challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract. </p><p>  Contracting authorities are best placed to gauge whether the use of such clauses is appropriate to a particular procurement process. As these clauses are included in the contract performance element of the contract, data on the many individual elements agreed at contracting authority level is not collected centrally. However, I am informed by the Office of Government Procurement that they have such contract clauses in their centralised contracts for clothing such as uniforms. </p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that a revised set of EU Directives governing public procurement have recently been agreed. The revised directives, when implemented, should provide greater scope and legal clarity in relation to the use of social criteria in the context of an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p></reply>

Therefore contracting authorities have some flexibility in conducting the appropriate competitive tendering process. For example, they are not tied to the prescribed tendering procedures or timeframes for submission of tenders or expressions of interest and there is scope for dialogue and negotiation conducted in an open and fair objective manner.</p><p>  However, it is a basic principle of national public procurement policy that a competitive process should always be used unless there are justifiably exceptional circumstances. Whilst it is recognised that many public authorities already tender for their legal services. My Department has issued guidelines last year to re-iterate that in procuring these advisory services, public tendering should be the norm. The Circular also sets out for the first time a helpful guide for public bodies on some straightforward measures they should take, (including under Rules of Court), to better manage and control their legal costs.</p><p>  In addition, my Department, through the Office of Government Procurement, has a particular responsibility to assist public bodies that procure legal services with the objective of leveraging resources in order to achieve best value for money. In that regard the Office of Government Procurement will examine the spend on legal services across the public service and carry out a review of the markets for the various commonly used services involved to determine the appropriate commercial strategies for how such services are procured.</p></reply>

It is also worth noting that within the overall Employment Control Framework, each Government Department retains flexibility and discretion on exactly how staff resources are allocated in line with priorities.</p><p>  Regarding local government, the day-to-day management of the Moratorium  in respect of local authorities is a matter, in the first instance, for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  The latest figures show that local authorities numbers have reduced by just under 7,500 over the last five years, but along with this there has been recruitment into key posts and service areas.  There has also been signficant reform and organisational restructuring, with more on the horizon, which is delivering a leaner, more efficient local government sector.  The plans for further reform in the local government sector are outlined in the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016.  Details about exceptions to the Moratorium are being compiled and I will have these forwarded to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Discussions on such arrangements have not taken place with the Department of Finance in regard to tax reliefs or with other Departments. The provision of tax relief for homeowners for the purchase and installation of flood barriers and other protection devices is a matter for the Minister for Finance in the first instance.</p><p>  A central focus of the Government's strategy to address flood risk is the implementation of a significant capital investment programme to build major flood relief schemes in the main areas at risk of flooding. A total of &euro;225m has been allocated to the OPW over the period 2012 &ndash; 2016 and significant schemes are underway and at planning/design stage which will protect and benefit a substantial number of properties. OPW's capital allocation of &euro;45m per annum is fully committed to expenditure on the delivery of these major flood relief schemes as well as to expenditure on the operation of its Minor Works Scheme which provides funding to local authorities to allow them undertake smaller scale works to deal with localised flooding problems. A significant part of the annual budget is allocated also to the implementation of the national Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. </p><p>  In assessing flood risk at any particular location, the installation of individual property protection may have a role to play in certain instances and this would be factored into the consideration of options to address flood risk at that particular location.</p></reply>

The Protected Disclosures Bill, 2013, establishing a detailed and comprehensive legislative framework protecting whistleblowers in all sectors of the economy, was passed by the Seanad late last year, has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il recently, and is expected to be enacted by late April/early May.  The Freedom of Information Bill 2013, published in July 2013, restores Ireland's FOI legislation and extends FOI to all public bodies.  It completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il last November and is expected to be enacted before the Summer.  In tandem with work on the new FOI Bill, a revised draft Code of Practice for FOI for Public Bodies is in the process of being finalised drawing on the report and recommendations of FOI users, advocates and expert academic researchers in FOI nationally and internationally, as well as FOI experts in public bodies. Following Government approval it is intended to publish the draft Code for public consultation with a view to having it completed on or before enactment of the new FOI legislation.</p><p>  Drafting of the General Scheme of a Bill by my Department to overhaul the current ethics framework is at an advanced stage. The draft Heads of a Bill based on a review of the current statutory framework for ethics, the recommendations of the Mahon Tribunal and international best practice are intended to consolidate, simplify and modernise the current legal framework. A joint process is underway involving officials and representatives of civil society interests aimed at developing Ireland's first Open Government Partnership (OGP) National Action Plan.  The finalisation of this plan following its approval by Government will enable Ireland's full membership of the OGP reaffirming Ireland's commitment to open,  transparent and accountable public governance.  A project has commenced to facilitate the implementation of the commitments encompassed by the Open Data Initiative I announced at the OGP Summit in London in autumn 2013.  A comprehensive programme of Statute Law Revision has been approved by Government.  It is anticipated that the first Bill developed under this new programme will be published later this year.  A consultation paper Strengthening Civil Service Accountability and Performance has been published and an a  public consultation process is currently underway. The aim of this process is to reform and reconfigure the relationship between ministers and their departments and civil servants to ensure that there is greater clarity about who is responsible to whom for what.  An Independent Panel has been established to manage and oversee this consultation process, review submissions received and to submit recommendations  for my consideration by May 2014.</p><p>The Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 is now in force having significantly extended the Ombudsman's remit and strengthened the Ombudsman's powers.  The Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 was commenced last September.</p></reply>

The question at issue was whether it is a violation of Article 11 of the ECHR to prevent people from obtaining employment if they refuse to be a member of a trade union that has concluded a closed-shop agreement with the enterprise in question.</p><p>  Danish law specifically excluded from protection from dismissal on grounds of not being a member of an association or of a specified association, cases where the employee knew prior to employment that said membership was a condition of employment.The issue of the closed shop is not provided for specifically in Irish law.</p><p>  Closed shops can be divided into two categories: pre-entry and post-entry. A pre-entry closed shop is a situation whereby persons are required to be members of a specific union before they can obtain certain jobs. A post-entry closed shop is a situation whereby existing employees are required to join a specific trade union after they have engaged in employment.  </p><p>  The Irish Courts have considered closed shop arrangements in a number of legal cases. The judgements suggest that employees have a right to disassociate where a closed shop arrangement is introduced and enforced against a worker already in employment (i.e. post-entry closed shop). </p><p>  However, the Irish Courts have not ruled definitively on the constitutionality of either the pre-entry closed shop or the post-entry closed shop as it is applied to newly-recruited employees.

Under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, an employee who has a minimum of 13 weeks&rsquo; service with an employer is entitled to notice of termination of employment.  The length of notice to which an employee is entitled is dependant on the length of service of the employee and can range between one week&rsquo;s notice for an individual with less than 2 years&rsquo; service up to eight weeks&rsquo; notice for an individual with more than fifteen years&rsquo; service.  Where an employer is unable to provide or does not provide the appropriate notice, then the employer may make a payment in lieu of the notice.  An employee who does not receive their minimum notice entitlements may take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p><p>  Under the Protection of Employment Act 1977, companies proposing collective redundancies must enter into consultation with the employee representatives at least 30 days before anyone receives notice of redundancy.  They must also notify the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of the proposed redundancies at least 30 days before any employee receives notice of redundancy.  The consultation with the employee representatives and the notification period for the Minister can run concurrently.</p><p>  In accordance with the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2012, employees who have at least two years&rsquo; continuous service with an employer are generally entitled to a statutory redundancy payment in the event of being made redundant.  The administration of the Redundancy Payments legislation is within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, who has advised that it is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all eligible employees.   However, where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department of Social Protection that he/she is unable to pay statutory redundancy to his/her eligible employees, that Department will make lump sum payments directly to those employees. Such payments are made from the Social Insurance Fund and result in a debt being raised against the employer which the Department of Social Protection will seek to recover.    Where an employer either fails to comply with his or her Redundancy payment obligations or where there is a dispute regarding redundancy entitlements, claims may be referred by the employee to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  There is a time limit of 52 weeks for such redundancy claims but, in certain circumstances, a claim will be considered up to two years after the redundancy at the discretion of the Tribunal and where reasonable cause is shown.  </p><p>  Where an employer is legally insolvent (liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy etc.) and, as a result, defaults on payment of wages and other entitlements, an employee may be entitled to seek redress from the State under the Insolvency Payments Scheme which is operated by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.  These payments also cover overtime, holiday pay, sick pay etc.  In these circumstances, redundancy payment entitlements may also be made from the Social Insurance Fund.</p><p>  In terms of the specific case raised by the Deputy, I am informed by the Minister for Social Protection that the person in question made a claim for arrears of wages, holiday pay and minimum notice under the Insolvency Payments Scheme which is operated by that Department.   That claim was awarded and payment issued to the liquidator on 9 November 2012.   The Department of Social Protection has advised that, if the person has not received that payment from the liquidator, he should contact the liquidator&rsquo;s office.</p><p>  Further, the Department of Social Protection has not received any claim for a statutory redundancy payment in respect of the person concerned.   One of the qualifying conditions for a statutory redundancy payment is that the person must have at least two years continuous service with the relevant employer.    In this case, the information supplied on the person&rsquo;s insolvency scheme application indicates that he has less than 12 months service.  That being the case he would not qualify for a statutory redundancy payment.</p><p>  The Information Unit of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) has been restructured and expanded to form a new Workplace Relations Customer Service Section which provides information on employees&rsquo; rights and how to obtain redress if employees&rsquo; rights have been infringed, and it can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 and at website www.workplacerelations.ie</p></reply>

Many of these markets are also ones with whom the EU is negotiating Free Trade Agreements that will accelerate the creation of new market access for exporters.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland has already built up a vast amount of knowledge and connections right across these markets and these are a vital resource available to support its clients globalise their businesses.</p><p>  In their exports to Brazil, India, Russia and China, targeted Gulf States and the Asia Pacific region Enterprise Ireland client companies grew their exports by an impressive 70% between 2008 and 2012. While significant, this only represents about 12% of the agency&rsquo;s client exports. The recalibration of export markets as set out in the Review will help accelerate growth in our exports to these regions.  </p><p>  To this end Enterprise Ireland continues an ongoing realignment of resources to enhance delivery of client services in high growth markets, and received sanction in 2013 to add a further 20 staff to bolster resources available to client companies in fast growing markets. </p><p>  The review is an important aspect of the Winning Abroad Disruptive Reform and will ensure that the impact of State resources are maximised in priority markets, giving them and Irish companies the best possible platform to win business overseas. The new direction also re-aligns the list of priority sectors so that they dovetail with the Action Plan for Jobs.  </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland works actively with Forf&aacute;s and the Expert Group on Future Skills needs to identify the skills gaps its clients are facing and to effectively increase their export capacity.</p><p>In 2012, the Forf&aacute;s / EGFSN Report <i>Key Skills for Enterprise to Trade Internationally </i>  made recommendations aimed at ensuring that education and training provision would be aligned to the international trade skills requirements of enterprise.  A main recommendation was the need to boost the supply (quantity and proficiency) of foreign language skills and cultural awareness being taught at third level - for German, French, Spanish, Italian and emerging BRIC markets. </p><p>  On 27 February this year, the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, the third annual instalment in the Government plan aimed at building a sustainable growing economy and creating jobs, was published.  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a priority commitment on the part of the Minister for Education to develop and publish a languages education strategy.  The development of this languages strategy in 2014 is one of the ways in which the Government will support Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;winning abroad&rdquo; agenda.</p></reply>

There are many complex factors influencing investor location decision-making such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus population, significant challenges from lower cost locations in the UK and Eastern Europe and attractive regional aid.</p><p>  Offaly, together with Laois, Longford, Westmeath and Roscommon forms IDA&rsquo;s Midland Region.  The location of emphasis for IDA Ireland in the Midlands Region is the linked Gateway of Tullamore, Athlone and Mullingar, which IDA actively promotes to potential investors through its network of overseas offices. </p><p>  In County Offaly there are 11 IDA supported companies employing approximately 845 people, while in the region as a whole there are 43 IDA client companies employing 4,812 people.  IDA Ireland engages with these companies on an ongoing basis to encourage operational stability, job retention and in certain cases expansion.</p><p>  In marketing the Midlands for new foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland is focused on attracting overseas companies in the Medical Technologies, Life Sciences and International Business sectors.   IDA Ireland also works closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county are being developed.</p><p>  I am glad to say that during 2013 the Succeed in Ireland initiative<b></b>  announced a 50 person project for the Magni Group to be located in Portarlington.</p><p>  IDA Ireland has also invested significantly in the development of property solutions in the Midlands Region that can meet the requirements of new and existing FDI clients.  IDA Ireland will continue to market the available lands and buildings in the Midlands Gateway.  In respect of Co. Offaly, IDA has a fully serviced Business Park in Srah, Tullamore with a number of green field sites available for projects. </p><p>  I am concerned at the lack of investment in certain regional locations and I have, accordingly requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations. This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken. This analysis, will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI, the changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid rules that will be introduced in 2014 and our approach to regional development will inform the formulation of an appropriate FDI strategy from 2015 onwards.</p></reply>

According to a survey of the Community Enterprise Centres commissioned by the National Association of Community Enterprise Centres (NACEC) there were 3712 jobs in 832 enterprises across the 76 centres that responded to the survey.</p><p>  In January 2012, Enterprise Ireland introduced a &euro;2m fund to support the appointment of 46 Business Development Managers to sustain and scale up tenants and employment numbers within the Community Enterprise Centres that were previously funded by Enterprise Ireland.  </p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government places strong emphasis on the potential for entrepreneurship and job creation at community and local level.  To that end, the Government is bringing about a transformation of the supports and advice available to businesses at local level through the creation of the Local Enterprise Office (LEO) network.  The LEOs will operate from within the Local Authorities but funding and policy will be provided by my Department and Enterprise Ireland to ensure consistency with other supports for enterprise.  In that regard, I have asked Enterprise Ireland to ensure that the Community Enterprise Centres and each LEO work very closely together.  </p><p>  I understand that Enterprise Ireland is considering its supports for Community Enterprise Centres and in a number of months, I expect them to report back on their preferred approach to supporting these facilities. </p><p>  The LEOs will replace the existing City and County Enterprise Boards which will be dissolved.  An Evaluation and Approvals Committee will be established in each LEO area to assess applications for financial support.  This Committee will consist of a Chair (City or County Manager), a representative of Enterprise Ireland, and five local individuals with specific areas of business expertise. </p><p>  As such, the LEOs will not have a Board but, as said earlier, I do envisage that there will be a high level of co-operation and co-ordination between LEOs and other providers of support to the micro and small business sector, including the National Association of Community Enterprise Centres. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-04a.441.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014030400056#WRJ01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 194 together.  </p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the lead Department for severe weather emergencies and the Office of Public Works has responsibility for capital flood relief activities.  However, the Department of Social Protection (DSP) has an important role to play in assisting households in the immediate aftermath of emergency events such as the recent severe weather conditions under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA). </p><p>  A humanitarian assistance scheme was approved by Government in November 2009.  The scheme, which is means tested, is available to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding and who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair.  Motor vehicles are not covered under the scheme.  Levels of payment under the scheme depend on the relative severity of damage experienced and the household&rsquo;s ability to meet these costs ensuring that the funding is appropriately targeted.  Humanitarian assistance does not cover risks that are covered by insurance policies or cover business or commercial losses.  </p><p>  Guidelines have been provided to officers responsible for administering the humanitarian assistance scheme as to what type of goods and appliances are generally covered by the scheme and what replacement value should typically be attributable to each item, as set out in the tabular statement below.  This list is not exhaustive and is intended as a guide only. </p><p>  In dealing with events of this nature the DSP generally adopts a three stage approach as follows:</p><p>  - Stage 1 is to provide emergency income support payments for food, clothing, personal items and temporary accommodation in the immediate aftermath of the event. A relatively small amount of financial assistance is generally provided initially but this will increase as the extent of the problems become clearer. Payments are made immediately mainly in respect of food, clothing, toiletries and accommodation.</p><p>  - Stage 2 generally involves the replacement of white goods, basic furniture items and other essential household items.  It is not until the flood water abates and houses dry out that the full extent of the damage to homes will become known.  Payments under this phase are normally processed within 2 to 3 working days of the receipt of a valid application and supporting documentation. In Limerick, payments are currently issuing under this phase in respect of white goods, furniture, etc. with payments ranging from &euro;2,000 to &euro;4,000.</p><p>  - Stage 3 is to identify what longer term financial support or works are required.  It could take several months before this stage of response commences and this involves a cross Departmental/Agency response.  The type of work carried out can include plastering, dry-lining, relaying of floors, electrical re-wiring, painting etc. Payments under this phase will generally take longer to process as homeowners establish the cost of repair by securing builders&rsquo; estimates and the extent of the loss is verified, usually by a loss assessor, in cases where significant amounts are claimed. </p><p>  To date, over &euro;213,000 in respect of over 370 applications has been paid under the humanitarian assistance scheme to people in Co. Limerick. </p><p>  Department officials are liaising with local authorities and other agencies to ensure supports are provided to those affected by the recent flooding as swiftly as possible.  Emergency clinics and on-call services have been established in a number of affected areas and officials have made home visits to persons identified as requiring this level of support. The Department has utilised social media, namely Twitter, to further publicise the humanitarian assistance scheme.  The network of Citizens Information Centres (CICs), which operate from 268 locations nationwide, provide support in publicising DSP supports, ensuring that the public have access to information and advice on the scheme, and also assistance in the completion of application forms. </p><p>Applications for funding under the humanitarian assistance scheme are available, along with further detail on the scheme, on the Department&rsquo;s website at .  Application forms are also available at local offices responsible for administering SWA and through the network of CICs.  </p><p>  In relation to supports for fishermen, in many instances persons operating fishing vessels will be self-employed workers. Self-employed workers can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in levels of work.  To qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, a self-employed person must satisfy all of the scheme conditions, including the requirement to be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.   In general, the means applying to their claim will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and account is taken of any exceptional circumstances, such as damage to lobster pots etc caused by the recent bad weather,  so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  </p><p>  Where persons, being employees on fishing vessels as opposed to self-employed workers, suffer losses of employment they may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance subject to normal scheme criteria, which includes being available for and genuinely seeking full-time work. </p><p>  In addition, persons who have no income may be entitled to a basic weekly SWA payment, for example, while they are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment, subject to meeting certain criteria of the SWA scheme.   </p><p>  Any person who is experiencing hardship as a result of the recent weather events should contact the Department&rsquo;s local representative administering SWA who may be able to offer assistance.  </p><p><b>Tabular Statement - Humanitarian Assistance Essential Goods Guideline</b><table><tr><th>Household Item</th><th>Recommended Amount Payable</th><th>Household Item</th><th>Recommended Amount Payable</th></tr><tr><td>Kitchen</td><td></td><td>Miscellaneous Items</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cooker: Electric</td><td> &euro;310 </td><td>Cutlery Set </td><td> &euro;25 </td></tr><tr><td>Cooker: Gas</td><td> &euro;310 </td><td>Crockery Set 4/Crockery Set 6</td><td> &euro;25/&euro;35</td></tr><tr><td>Fridge: Single</td><td> &euro;140 </td><td>Electric Iron</td><td> &euro;25 </td></tr><tr><td>Fridge/Freezer</td><td> &euro;250 </td><td>Electric Kettle</td><td> &euro;25 </td></tr><tr><td>Kitchen Chair</td><td> &euro;40 </td><td>Frying Pan</td><td> &euro;13 </td></tr><tr><td>Kitchen Table</td><td> &euro;120 </td><td>Ironing Board </td><td> &euro;20 </td></tr><tr><td>Microwave</td><td> &euro;80 </td><td>Mop and Handle</td><td> &euro;15 </td></tr><tr><td>Table &amp;amp;

Under these Agreements, redeployment generally takes precedence over all other methods of filling a vacancy. It facilitates the movement of staff both within and across sectors as a result of the rationalisation, reconfiguration or restructuring of public service bodies or where activities have assumed lesser priority arising from changing business needs. </p><p>Redeployment for the civil service and non-commercial semi state bodies is operated by the Public Appointments Service (PAS), which also arranges for cross-sectoral assignments to be made, where necessary.  It is a matter for individual organisations to notify the PAS of the details of staff to be placed on the panel.  A  setting out the background and full details on the processes involved has been agreed with the staff unions and is available at <i>. </i></p><p>  The agreed arrangements for the redeployment staff within the Health, Education, and Local Government sectors are managed directly by those sectors.  Where an organisation in another sector has verified to the PAS that its sectoral opportunities have been fully explored and that cross-sectoral redeployment is essential to allow for the placement of its staff, they may notify the PAS of the details of the staff it wishes placed on the Resource Panel. Assignments by the PAS are made on the basis of best fit for the post. The PAS consider a broad range of factors when matching those available on the Resource Panel with an available vacancy and before reassigning a person permanently to another employer/sector, including:  pay; ability to discharge the duties of the new post; suitability; basis of assignment; tenure; nature of the post, and policies of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to mobility and redeployment.</p></reply>

In addition, both schemes apply only where a person is employed for no more than three in a period of any seven consecutive days, is available for full-time employment and is genuinely seeking such work.

In particular, a part-time or casual worker who is employed for three days or less in any week receives the appropriate weekly rate of the allowance which is net of means assessed from other sources, less an amount deducted for each day of employment.

A child who is residing with a parent, adoptive parent or step-parent is not regarded as an orphan.  In cases where both parents of a child are dead, and an application is made for guardian&rsquo;s payment, the death certificates of both parents have to be examined.   In other cases, where one or both of the child&rsquo;s parents are still alive, a Deciding Officer will thoroughly consider all the evidence available and assess the relationship between the parent(s) and the child concerned in order to establish whether the child in question has been abandoned by their parent(s).</p><p>  While a decision is made based on the evidence available in each individual case, typically the evidence considered by a Deciding Officer will include:</p><p>  - reports from social welfare inspectors;</p><p>  - reports from social workers employed by the Health Service Executive;</p><p>  - statements made by the parent or parents of the child;</p><p>  - statements made by the person caring for the child or any other parties involved in the overall welfare of the child. </p><p>  Once a decision is made on a guardians application, the claimant is notified of the outcome.  If the claimant is not satisfied with the decision of the Deciding Officer, it is open to them to appeal that decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, within 21 days, and their appeal will be considered by an independent Appeals Officer.</p></reply>

Analysis also shows that there are properties available in County Wicklow within the maximum rent limits with approximately 2,350 rent supplement tenancies in place.

The deduction applies to the person&rsquo;s personal rate only, and does not affect payment of any adult or child dependent allowances, or any other allowances that are in payment.  </p><p>  A deduction of 15% from a person&rsquo;s personal rate of payment allows them to retain 85% of that payment.  The person concerned is offered the opportunity to give his/her views on the proposed deduction.

In the circumstances where the person has been in receipt of money to which they were not entitled, this is considered to be reasonable.

At the end of January 2014 there were 1,841 pending applications for invalidity pension, 2,621 for carer&rsquo;s allowance, which are within our tolerance levels and 4,472 for disability allowance which is slightly above.  All of these cases are actioned and awaiting further information.  Furthermore, invalidity pension applications are now decided on average within 8 weeks, carer's allowance within 10 weeks, while disability allowance applications are now decided on average within 10 weeks.  It should be noted that the processing time for individual applications can vary depending on the complexity of the applicant's circumstances and the completeness of the information they provide in support.</p><p>  As a consequence of the very high number of decisions made in the last year, there has been a corresponding substantial increase in the number of appeals being received.  This had put pressure on the administration of appeals and resulted in some delays which are regrettable.  Greater emphasis has been placed on ensuring that all appeals are processed in a timely manner and improvements in the time taken to process appeals continues to be made.  However because of its quasi-judicial nature the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.</p></reply>

Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there have been increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas.  Special provisions can be made in exceptional circumstances to exceed the rent limits including, for example, people with disabilities who require specially adapted accommodation or homeless persons. </p><p>  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has a minimum income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum weekly contribution of &euro;30 for a single person or &euro;40 for a couple.  Where a person has an additional income above the rate of SWA they are, in certain circumstances, required to top up their rent.</p><p>  The tenant, landlord or landlord&rsquo;s agent must complete the rent supplement application form declaring that the information provided is accurate.  The form clearly states that making a false statement or withholding information may lead to prosecution.</p><p>  The Department, in June 2012, introduced powers of enquiry for staff to formally request and oblige landlords to provide information in respect of rent supplement tenants, principally to verify the agreed rent and tenancy.</p><p>  Any instance of false declarations of the amount of rent payable should be reported to the relevant Department representatives who have specific legislative powers to deal with such offences.  In such cases the Department&rsquo;s representative will discuss the circumstances of the case with the tenant before making any decision in relation to ongoing entitlement.  Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.</p></reply>

In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in levels of work.   </p><p>  The term &lsquo;fish assist&rsquo; was previously used to describe a feature of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme and referred to the aspects of the means assessment, that were discontinued under measures in Budget 2012 and Budget 2013, which applied to certain categories of self-employed fishermen within the scheme.  </p><p>  Under the current jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance means assessment the means of a self-employed person will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  Typically over 80% of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance claims from self-employed persons have been awarded over recent years.  </p><p>  In addition, employees in the fishing industry who suffer a loss of employment may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance subject to normal scheme criteria which includes being available for and genuinely seeking full-time work. </p><p>  It may also be noted that if a person has no income they may be entitled to the basic supplementary welfare allowance. If weekly income is below the supplementary welfare allowance rate for their family size, a payment may be made to bring their income up to the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate. Also exceptional needs payments may help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. </p><p>  Any changes to these provisions would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-04a.543.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014030400058#WRL02000"><p>The potential risk to An Post business into the future has been the subject of in-depth discussion over the past week.  I think this is only right, given the importance of the network to the social fabric of our society. </p><p>  In this regard, I am very happy to provide my own support for the post office network and the valuable work being delivered by postmasters throughout the country.  On the 20th   December last year, I was very pleased to be able to sign a new contract with An Post for over-the-counter cash services for welfare clients following an EU-wide procurement competition.  The contract, which is for a minimum period of 2 years with the option to extend to a maximum of 6 years, is very substantial in terms of its reach, value and impact.  Therefore I am happy to be able to confirm that these services will continue for large numbers of welfare clients into the future, as provided for under the terms of the contract.</p><p>  The continuation of over-the-counter cash payment services supports some nine hundred thousand (900,000) customers currently.  These services are provided through a network of over 1,300 post offices and agencies around the country, the larger number of which are run as vibrant commercial retail outlets and operations by individual postmasters and their staff.  </p><p>  Last year approximately &euro;9.5 billion was paid in cash to our clients at post offices. This accounted for 43.7 million transactions and cost the Department just under &euro;75 million (including internal processing costs). By comparison, some 37 million payments were issued directly into accounts in financial institutions by electronic funds transfer (EFT) and this costs the Department under &euro;9 million.  In short, cash payments are an inherently more expensive means of paying clients.  The differential reflects to a large part the additional costs incurred for securely packing, processing, transporting, delivering and issuing cash to clients. The Department must address such a significant variation in costs in the interests of the economy, taxpayers and welfare clients. </p><p>  Mindful of the scope, scale and impact of these payments, the Department undertook a root and branch examination of its payment processes, methods and approaches.  This resulted in the preparation of a payment strategy which was approved by the Government last year.  The strategy has the goal of reducing significantly the level at which welfare payments are made in cash and thereby minimising the associated expensive fees.    Furthermore, cash limits the options for customers to make onward transactions.  It limits the scope for customers to avail of cheaper prices online and curtails financial inclusion of customers. It is also at odds with trends in consumer behaviour generally as they migrate towards electronic payment channels.</p><p>  As to whether new welfare customers are now being requested to provide bank account details, the only change in operational arrangements recently stem from the new options being provided to older job-seeking clients who are transitioning from employment. </p><p>  Up until Budget 2014, older jobseekers were required, as part of their entitlement to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, to be available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work.  In addition, they like other jobseekers were required to comply, when requested to so do, with the Department&rsquo;s activation measures.  Legislation provided that non-compliance with such activation measures, without good cause, would give rise to the imposition of penalties in the form of payment reductions.  Revised conditions were announced as part of Budget 2014 to apply to older persons who seek the support of jobseekers schemes in advance of reaching pension age.  The measures provide for these clients to continue to avail of Departmental supports on a voluntary basis should they wish to return to work, training or education.  In addition, provision is made for these clients to receive their payments directly into an account in a financial institution if they so wish. Letters have been sent to existing clients in this cohort advising them of these budgetary changes.  Those letters also reference the option of being paid electronically.  New job-seeking clients in this cohort are being offered the option to be paid into an account in a financial institution for their own convenience. If and when An Post can provide a mechanism for direct payments into a post office account as available in bank and a large number of credit unions around the country, the Department will happily facilitate clients&rsquo; instructions to pay funds directly into such an account. </p><p>  Clearly the trend is towards electronic payments as a matter of choice.  This choice is supported by wider Government policies and objectives on better public services and more effective electronic payments as set out in the public service reform plan and the eGovernment strategy 2012-2015.  These goals are shared by the national payments plan and the roll-out of the standard bank account. These initiatives have made the case quite strongly for a move to electronic payments which will contribute to improved national competitiveness. The Department&rsquo;s clients are displaying a clear disposition towards electronic payments as a matter of choice without intervention by the Department.   The recent letters to clients alerting them to an easing of conditions during their transitional period from employment reflect these realities and offer wider options to these clients. </p></reply>

In a scheme introduced in 1991, following lengthy consultation with interested parties, mooring discs were issued to all boat owners having a recognised traditional mooring right, subject to an overall limit on the number of discs issued. It is considered that a limit is necessary so as to balance recreational use with the conservation imperative of flora and fauna of the area and also taking account of obligations under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. My Department does not permit the casual placing of boats on a daily basis, as boats and engines coming from outside carry the risk of spreading invasive alien species such as zebra mussels and various pond weeds. To facilitate others, persons applying for mooring pegs are placed on a waiting list and any pegs becoming available are allocated to those on the list. In order to facilitate the short-term accommodation of some of those on the waiting list, they are entered into a lottery each year for one of 20 temporary mooring pegs. The 2014 lottery took place on 20 February last under the supervision of Department officials and local angling club members. Offers of discs have since issued to those persons drawn from the lottery.</p><p>  My Department receives numerous requests for mooring spaces but, unfortunately, the demand far exceeds the number of spaces available. My Department is currently in the process of reviewing all issues relating to the ongoing management of the site in question, including all boating activities, with a view to developing a more long-term and sustainable strategy.</p></reply>

The Bank of Ireland at College Green is one of the most iconic buildings in Dublin City. It was the first purpose-built Parliament in Europe, completed in 1739, and served as Ireland&rsquo;s Parliament until the Act of Union in 1801.</p><p>  The space for the Centre will be made available to the State for a ten year period, to run alongside the Decade of Centenaries. It is envisaged that exhibitions at the Centre will include a significant focus on key events in Irish history &ndash; up to the centenary of the Civil War &ndash; which led to the creation of modern Ireland, which also includes a strong cultural component.</p><p>  Bank of Ireland will cover the costs of refurbishing the space and operating the Centre. My Department, in partnership with the Bank, will manage, operate and animate the Centre. I very much welcome Bank of Ireland's decision to make the space available and would like to thank it for strongly supporting this initiative.</p><p>  I will shortly be establishing an expert committee drawn from the National Cultural Institutions and other city institutions to advise me on a suitable programme of exhibitions and events at the new Centre.  This programme will have a significant focus on the social, economic and political events of the Decade of Centenaries.</p><p>  As the matter is at an early stage of development, it would be premature to offer specifics about the programme of events or the operation of the Centre, in advance of the discussions of the expert committee.  However, I believe the Centre will have a significant impact on enriching the cultural programme during the Decade of Centenaries over the next 10 years.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that a private company such as the Irish Ship and Barge Fabrication Company is not an accountable body in this matter so the issue of excluding it from the meeting did not arise. I also wish to point out that the decision to dispose of the Naomh &Eacute;anna was not taken by me but by its owners, the Irish Nautical Trust. The Naomh &Eacute;anna has been moored at Grand Canal Dock since 1989 when it was found to no longer meet health and safety requirements to operate as a passenger-carrying vessel. Unfortunately, the ship has deteriorated substantially in the past 20 years and presents a real risk in the Grand Canal Basin, in the heart of Dublin's Docklands. In April 2013, a report on the hull condition of the vessel, commissioned by its owners, highlighted serious safety concerns. Based on the report&rsquo;s findings, the Irish Nautical Trust issued a &lsquo;<i>Notice to Vacate</i>  &rsquo; to both of the businesses that had been operating from the vessel.</p><p>I am advised that very significant investment would be required to preserve the already unstable hull of the vessel and to bring the vessel to the point where it would be safe and insurable. I am further advised that the vessel's owners do not have the financial resources to deal with these issues. In the circumstances, Waterways Ireland offered to arrange for the removal and disposal of the ship on behalf of the Irish Nautical Trust.  Waterways Ireland made this offer as the property owners of the Grand Canal Dock because of the continuing serious risk posed by the condition of the Naomh &Eacute;anna, the disruption and expense that would be involved were it to sink in the Grand Canal Dock and the absence of any firm indication that the very significant level finance required to make it safe and insurable was potentially available. The Irish Nautical Trust accepted the offer and confirmed its approval to Waterways Ireland to dispose of the vessel on its behalf. </p><p>  In relation to the suggestion that decisions on the vessel's future be deferred for three months, the Deputy will be aware that I advised Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 26 February that interested individuals or groups who wish to restore the vessel now have until 31 March to come up with a realistic proposal. Any such proposal would have to be based on a credible, definitive business plan with access to the required finance and, in that regard, I must re-iterate that there is no question of State funding being made available.

It is listed in Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive and requires the designation of Special Areas of Conservation for its protection. The factors contributing to its decline are well understood and as such did not require further research funded by my Department in the last 10 years.    However my Department, and other Departments before it, have funded and/or contributed to surveys and reports on mussel populations in key rivers in order to gain a clear picture of the status of the mussel. There is grave concern about the lack of survival of juvenile mussels in most rivers, due to their particular sensitivity to pollution and siltation. A list is being forwarded directly to the Deputy of these studies which encompass (i) population monitoring required under Article 17 of the directive, (ii) river basin management planning and (iii) captive breeding trials (for the Nore mussel). These studies help to inform how best challenges might be addressed in collaboration with key stakeholders.</p><p>  The species&rsquo; current poor conservation status and severe decline is considered to be due to activities in or adjacent to watercourses causing a quality of water that does not meet the exacting requirements of the species. The sediment and nutrients that enter mussel rivers and cause its decline can come from a combination and wide variety of sources (e.g. urban wastewater, development activities, farming and forestry), often quite removed from the location of the species or widespread in the catchment of the river. The species can also suffer direct impacts from in-stream works such as channelisation, bridge-construction and recreational fishery structures.</p></reply>

In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources, with the transport target also being legally binding. </p><p>  To date onshore wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity and will contribute most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.  It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 MW and 4,000 MW of onshore wind generation capacity will be required by 2020.  Other technologies such as electricity from biomass, hydroenergy and ocean energy will also contribute to our 40% renewable electricity target.  EirGrid, in accordance with its responsibilities as the Transmission System Operator (TSO), has prepared a Transmission Development Plan for the period 2013&ndash;2023 outlining the developments which will be required to meet future requirements of the electricity grid as they are known at this time, including the requirement to accommodate renewable generation.</p><p>  It is expected that most of the 12% renewable heat target will be achieved through the use of biomass technologies.  The uptake of the CHP capacity under REFIT 3, launched in early 2012, will make a contribution to achieving this along with migration to renewable heat in response to market forces.  The requirements of Part L of the Building regulations are also expected to make a contribution to increasing the uptake of renewable heat.  These measures and developments will build on the increases in renewable heat which were achieved by schemes such as the Greener Homes Scheme, the Renewable Heat Deployment Programme (ReHeat) and the CHP Deployment Programme.  My Department is also currently finalising a Bioenergy Strategy which will set out the actions required to optimise the contribution that energy from biomass can make to achieving Ireland's 2020 renewable energy targets.  Analysis underpinning the strategy suggests that additional bioenergy measures can have a significant impact in the heat sector and recommendations will shortly be brought forward in this regard.</p><p>  The penetration of renewable energy in transport will grow mainly with the increased use of sustainable biofuels which is supported by way of the Biofuel Obligation Scheme.  The increased deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) is also expected to make a contribution to achieving the target for the transport sector and supports are currently in place to incentivise the purchase of these vehicles.  The ESB, through its ecars programme, is continuing to roll out both publicly accessible charging infrastructure and domestic charge points.  My Department understands that the ESB intends to have in place this year at least 1,000 publicly accessible charge points in all main towns and cities, as well as 60 fast chargers on major roads.</p></reply>

This figure excludes Turlough Hill which is a pumped storage system.</p><p>  A resource study titled &quot;The Small-Scale Hydro-electric Potential of Ireland&quot; was completed by the then Department of Energy in 1985 which concluded the additional available capacity was 38 MW.  This is a very small resource and would be consistent with expectations from small hydro developments on Irish rivers.  As it is deemed a small resource, little further investigation has been performed since. </p><p>  In 2012 electricity generated from hydro was 802 GigaWattHours (GWh).  Using normalised figures to adjust for annual variations in climate, as per EU Directive 2009/28/EC, hydro accounted for 759 GWh or 2.7% of gross electricity consumption in 2012.  This is provided primarily by 14 large scale hydro-electric generators. </p><p>  A number of major studies have been carried out by EirGrid over the past number of years to investigate the levels of renewable generation that can be securely accommodated on the power system of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The commercial viability of each renewable energy technology is a matter for the developers themselves.  The EirGrid studies have considered the requirements in terms of infrastructure and also the operational implications of managing a power system with large amounts of variable generation sources.

Currently, there are no tidal electricity generation facilities connected to the Irish grid.  However, tidal energy, along with wave energy and offshore wind, is one of the sectors identified for development in the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which I published on 7 February.  The OREDP will facilitate the development of our abundant offshore renewable energy across the three key pillars of environmental sustainability, technical feasibility and commercial viability. </p><p>  To ensure that the economic potential of offshore renewable energy is realised in a way that is environmentally sustainable, and takes into account the needs of other users of the marine environment, a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was carried out for the OREDP.  The overall conclusion of the SEA was that it would be possible to achieve the high scenario of 4,500 MW from offshore wind and 1,500 MW of wave and tidal devices without likely significant adverse effect on the environment.  Nevertheless, the SEA identified the need for collection and dissemination of data, and the monitoring of any potential significant environmental impacts arising from the development of offshore renewable energy installations (including tidal).</p><p>  Establishing the environmental monitoring requirements for offshore renewable developments will, therefore, be an early task in the implementation of the OREDP.  The OREDP, and the documentation relating to the SEA, are on my Department's website at .</p></reply>

In order to meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources.  While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our generation portfolio.  Figures for 2012 show that 19.6% of electricity demand was met from renewables.  Ireland is currently heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels to meet our energy needs.  The work of the Sustainable Authority of Ireland (SEAI) shows that, in total since 2006, wind energy has avoided in the order of &euro;1.1 billion in fossil fuel imports, primarily of gas, but also oil. </p><p>  To date wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.  In 2012, 15.3% of electricity demand was met by wind generation.  At the end of 2013, the total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid was around 2,300 MW.  It is estimated that a total of between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to meet its 40% renewable electricity target.  Currently, around 3,000 MW of renewable generation has taken up connection offers under the Gate 3 grid connection programme. </p><p>  EirGrid and the System Operator for Northern Ireland (SONI) have embarked on a multi-year programme "Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System" (DS3) which is designed to ensure that we can securely operate the power system with increasing amounts of variable non-synchronous renewable generation.  As part of its DS3 programme, EirGrid is looking at changes to ancillary services provided by conventional (fossil fuel) generators, to reflect the greater flexibility needed with growing levels of renewable energy on the power system.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the contract which my Department has in place with "3", the NBS service provider, the NBS mobile wireless service currently offers minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.  The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.</p><p>  My Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on "3", with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  The NBS contract also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service, as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates.</p><p>  My Department liaises very closely with "3" to ensure that any issues relating to service performance which are brought to its attention are addressed as quickly as possible.  With reference to service performance issues experienced by the person referred to in the Question, my officials have been advised by "3" that its engineer visited the customer's premises and having replaced a piece of faulty equipment, confirmed the NBS service to be within specification.  In addition, 3's engineer offered advice in relation to additional equipment which could help boost the broadband signal to other areas of the house.</p><p>  Should a customer wish to terminate their NBS contract prior to the expiry of the minimum term, as is standard industry practice, a cancellation fee applies which is equivalent to the total monthly charges due for the balance of the minimum contract term.  Such matters are operational matters for "3".  My Department officials have been informed by "3" that they were in direct contact with the customer regarding this matter and that they have no record of offering to waive the standard cancellation fee.  However, in this particular instance, I understand from "3" that they are amenable to reaching an agreeable solution.  My officials will contact the Deputy directly to arrange to progress the matter to conclusion.</p></reply>

Chapter 10 of Directive 2013/43/EU of 26 June 2013, also known as the Accounting Directive, introduces an obligation on large undertakings and all public-interest entities active in the extractive industries or the logging of primary forests to produce and publish a report on payments made to Government on an annual basis.  These provisions require to be given full effect in the legislation of all Member States by July 2015.  Directive 2013/50/EU of 22 October 2013, known as the Transparency Directive, also incorporates disclosure requirements of Chapter 10 of the Accounting Directive.

On a more general note, payments that could be made to the State resulting from the on-going exploration for our natural resources of oil or gas fall into two main categories.  The first category relates to application and administration fees, along with rental fees in respect of licensed acreage.  The second category relates to tax paid on profits from production of oil or gas.

The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act was introduced in 2006 to consider certain developments which are of strategic, economic or social importance to the State or to a region.  This means that planning applications for certain large scale private developments, generally of a scale requiring Environmental Impact Assessment, will be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la ('the Board') where previously such applications were the remit of the relevant Local Authority, with a right of appeal to the Board.  As part of its assessment of any such application, including oil or gas production developments, the Board is required to consult with all prescribed bodies.  My Department is a statutory consultee under this process and any observations it submits must be considered in coming to a decision with regard to the grant or otherwise of a planning development consent.</p><p>  In accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, potential developers are also required to apply to my Department for approval of a Plan of Development for the development and commercial operation of such a project.  Prescribed bodies such as the Board, along with any other parallel consent authority will also be consulted as part of this assessment process and their observations considered in coming to a decision with regard to the grant or otherwise of an approval.  If there is either a Foreshore Licence required from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government or an emission control licence required from the EPA, again parallel consent authorities, including my Department and the Board are consulted and their observations considered in the respective approval processes of both of these authorities.</p><p>  This is the assessment process which was implemented with respect to the most recent phase of the Corrib Gas Field Development with regard to the construction of the on-shore segment of the Corrib Gas Pipeline.  This application was submitted simultaneously to both the Board and my Department in April, 2010, with the two consent processes concluded by February, 2011.</p><p>  Finally, in 2010, the Oireachtas approved the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act 2010, which introduced a modern Petroleum Safety Framework for upstream petroleum activities, administered by the Commission for Energy Regulation </p><p>  It is not possible for the State to compulsorily acquire a share of any privately held extractive company intending to operate in Ireland.

In this regard, I welcome the progress that has been made by An Post towards diversification of the post office network's income streams.  Post offices have traditionally been based on the high street.  An Post's competitors are, however, establishing a presence in the larger retail outlets, where the bulk of the population conduct their weekly shopping.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-04a.666.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014030400060#WRN03200"><p>The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses including those in County Mayo.  This will be achieved by providing:</p><p>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment; and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m addresses with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively.  Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings.  The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services and is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband.</p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in Castlebar, County Mayo before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy.  Many of these developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles.  Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA).  Mapping data has been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing.  In many cases, this includes follow-up queries and requests for further information.</p><p>  The mapping data is being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines.  When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.  When this process is complete, it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government's proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country.  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

The Regulations set out a two-stage process for addressing environmental noise. </p><p>Firstly, noise must be assessed through the preparation of strategic noise maps for areas and infrastructure falling within defined criteria. This is undertaken by prescribed noise mapping bodies, which includes Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) and local authorities. Secondly, based on the results of the mapping process, the Regulations require the preparation of noise action plans for each area concerned, which is undertaken by the relevant local authority, the prescribed noise action planning body. The fundamental objective of action plans is the prevention and reduction of environmental noise.   </p><p>  The Regulations require the review and revision of strategic noise maps and noise action plans on a five year cycle. A new round of noise mapping was conducted during 2012. Following the noise mapping exercise, the four local authorities within the Dublin Agglomeration prepared a new Noise Action Plan for the period 2013 &ndash; 2018. The plan sets out an approach to the strategic management and control of environmental noise. The plan is available on the Dublin City Council website at the following link - </p><p>. </p><p>  The most recent noise mapping exercise found that 200 people are exposed to undesirable night time levels above 55 dB(A) from aircraft using Dublin Airport. As compared to the previous mapping exercise in 2007, there has been an overall reduction in the number of people exposed to undesirable night time noise levels.   </p><p>  In 2008, Dublin Airport Stakeholders Forum set up an Environmental Working Group that works closely with Fingal County Council. This group provides an effective forum for the discussion of all environment matters concerning the development and operation of the airport that have an impact on users, customers of the airport and on people living and working in the surrounding communities.   </p><p>  The management of noise abatement of operational procedures at Dublin Airport is shared by the airport operator, the DAA, and the airlines operating at the airport. Under the European Communities (Air Navigation and Transport Rules and Procedures for Noise Related Operating Restrictions at Airports) Regulations 2003, the Irish Aviation Authority has the responsibility of ensuring that the airport operator has in place a system of noise monitoring. </p><p>  In recognition of its responsibilities in this area, the DAA has introduced, and continues to evaluate, a number of initiatives to monitor aircraft noise levels and to mitigate their impact. A flight tracking system is now operated that allows aircraft movements to be analysed and to respond to any complaints relating to aircraft noise. The primary objective of the Noise &amp;amp; Flight Track Department of the DAA is to gather information on aircraft approach and departure routes and resultant noise levels at a number of key locations. </p></reply>

The Government decision was based on estimates provided by local authorities. Requests for funding of new works to protect coastal areas have been referred to the Office for Public Works and are not covered by the Government decision of 11 February 2014.   </p><p>  The arrangements for the drawing down of the funds by local authorities were finalised following discussions between local authorities, my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The local authorities which were worst affected have been notified of the sums being made available to them and have been requested to prioritise works which are significant for economic activity, with particular regard to the forthcoming tourist season. </p><p>  Further considerable damage has been caused by flooding and storm events that have occurred since 27 January. Details on damage caused and estimated repair costs in relation to these more recent events will be considered by the Government when they are available. </p><p>  My Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have had initial discussions with the European Commission on possible EU funding under the Solidarity and Regional Support schemes. The purpose of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) is to allow Member States to request financial aid in the event of major natural disasters.   There is a damage threshold per Member State which is set at 0.6% of GNI. The estimated costs of damage caused by the storms between 13 December 2013 and 6 January 2014 of &euro;61.472 m, plus other costs estimated at &euro;10 m, are well below the non-negotiable GNI threshold of 0.6% (&euro;770m in the case of Ireland) of the Solidarity Fund. </p><p>  The possibility of a regional application has also been considered. This is also subject to a series of impact criteria, including one relating to 50% of population of a region being affected. The situations which have occurred do not appear to meet these criteria and the probability of a successful regional application appears very low. </p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act (No. 2) 2013 provides for the transfer of water services functions from the local authorities to Irish Water. The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has been established as the new independent economic regulator for Irish Water.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for environmental regulatory matters in relation to Irish Water.   </p><p>  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014, which I signed last week, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean. Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations.  Hard water is not included as a parameter in the quality standards specified in the Regulations, as it does not pose as a threat to human health. An indicator parametric value of 50 micrograms per litre is set out in the regulations for Manganese. In the event of the parametric value being exceeded, the water supplier will investigate the cause and, in consultation with the EPA and, if a potential risk to human health may exist, the Health Service Executive, ensure that the appropriate remedial action is taken. The EPA is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with the regulations. </p><p>  The 2013 Act requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water. This is similar to the CER&rsquo;s statutory role in respect of the gas and electricity sectors. I fully expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in fulfilling its functions.   </p><p>  The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plans prepared by Irish Water, and for approving codes of practice to be prepared by Irish Water. The codes of practice will cover matters such as the standard of performance, by Irish Water, of its functions and billing by Irish Water of persons in respect of water services provided; the provision of information by Irish Water to its customers; and the making of complaints by its customers.  In discharging its functions, the CER may consult with Irish Water, the public, or any other person it considers appropriate.  The Commission has already undertaken public consultations on the development of the economic regulatory framework for water services and will be undertaking further consultations during 2014.  The Consumer Association of Ireland is a private body and has no statutory role in this matter.   </p><p>  An inter-departmental working group has been established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges.  The group is examining the issues arising for those with specific medical conditions which require high water usage in the course of its work.  </p><p>  The group comprises officials from my Department and from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. A final report will be submitted for consideration by Government when the group has completed its examination of the issues involved. This will allow for decisions on the proposed approach to be taken in advance of proposed public consultation by the Commission for Energy Regulation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs during 2014. </p></reply>

The Government decision was based on estimates provided by local authorities, including those received from Galway County Council and Galway City Council. Requests for funding of new works to protect coastal areas have been referred to the Office for Public Works and are not covered by the Government decision of 11 February 2014.   </p><p>  The information available to my Department does not differentiate the damage caused in Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht areas. The Report on the Severe Weather from 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014 contains details of estimates of the cost of damage caused on a county by county basis and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website (). The more detailed information being sought in the questions may be available on request from Galway County Council. </p><p>  The arrangements for the drawing down of the funds by local authorities on foot of the Government decision were finalised following discussions between local authorities, my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>  The local authority areas worst affected, including Galway County Council, have been notified of the sums being made available to them and have been requested to prioritise works which are significant for economic activity, with particular regard to the forthcoming tourist season. It is proposed to make a sum of up to &euro;9,491,055 available to Galway County Council for a programme of repair works to roads, piers and harbours, coastal protection repairs, tourism infrastructure and other facilities which are classified as necessary community infrastructure. I expect that Galway City Council will be notified this week of an allocation, based on the estimated costs submitted by them.   </p><p>  Local authorities have been requested to prepare and submit a programme of works for the projects identified showing the indicative timescales and drawdown profiles. These will be submitted directly to the relevant funding Departments/ Agencies as listed above. Local authorities have been informed that there will be a degree of flexibility available for prioritising projects to include works necessary as a result of more recent storms within the sub-headings of the overall funding envelope, pending preparation of more comprehensive assessment of the impacts of these recent storms. The flexibility in prioritising projects indicated above is permissible within individual programmes (e.g. roads) and not across the various programmes. The sum of &euro;9,491,055 for Galway is based on Galway County Council&rsquo;s estimates of repair costs provided to my Department and is allocated across a number of headings, as shown in the table. <table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Roads Infrastructure</th><th>Piers Harbours and</th><th>Coastal Protection Repairs</th><th>Tourism Infrastructure</th><th>Other Facilities</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council</td><td>2,773,500</td><td>1,589,500</td><td>1,144,800</td><td>1,652,500</td><td>2,330,755</td><td>9,491,055</td></tr></table></p><p>  In addition to the above funding arrangement, a once-off allocation of &euro;477,750 is being made to Galway County Council to recoup the costs associated with the response to the storms from the period 13 Dec 2013 to 27 Jan 2014. This includes the costs of response, clean-up works and necessary immediate works which were undertaken in the aftermath of the storms. This allocation will be drawn down from my Department on provision of appropriate documentation.   </p><p>  Further considerable damage has been caused by flooding and storm events that have occurred since 27 January.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.</p><p>  It was always anticipated that in the course of installing meters, pre-existing leaks and other latent defects due to the age or condition of the water pipes would be discovered.  Accordingly, where a leak occurs, it is not necessarily the case t hat it was caused by Irish Water&rsquo;s contractors.  The meter installation programme gives Irish Water a strong starting point for mains rehabilitation by enabling the discovery of pre-existing leaks and helping to target more effective investment in leak repair.  In order to ensure that there was no delay to the metering project and that no local authority was financially disadvantaged by having to redeploy resources, my Department provided funding to contribute towards this expenditure incurred between the start of the metering programme and 31 December 2013.  From 2014, the cost of these repairs is part of the operating costs of Irish Water, who can be contacted directly in the event of issues arising.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-03-04a.732.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014030400062#WRP01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 259, 268, 269 and 285 together.</p><p>  I wish to state clearly and unequivocally that self-build and building by direct labour arrangements continue to be possible under the new Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which came into operation on 1 March 2014.  The Building Control Act 1990 places a statutory obligation on owners, designers and builders to design and construct buildings in compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.  These statutory obligations apply to all sectors of the housing and construction market, including the self-build sector.  The new regulations will greatly strengthen the arrangements currently in place for the control of building activity by requiring greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates.</p><p>  In a self-build situation the legal responsibilities of both the owner and the builder will rest with the self-builder.  An owner who intends to self-build will, therefore, prior to commencement, notify the building control authority that they are the builder and also sign and lodge the new form of undertaking by the builder.  By signing the notice and the undertaking, the self-builder declares that they will ensure that they construct the dwelling in accordance with the design as certified; that they and any persons employed or engaged to undertake any part of the works will be competent to undertake such works; that they will cooperate with the inspection plan prepared by the Assigned Certifier (a registered construction professional who must be engaged during construction to inspect and certify the building);  and that they will take all reasonable steps to ensure they will certify the works, in conjunction with the assigned certifier, on completion. An extensive public consultation process was undertaken in 2012 to inform the development of the new regulations.  Comprehensive consultation documents were published including <i>Strengthening the Building Control System - A Document to inform public consultation on Draft Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2012</i>, which sets out the context in which the new regulations will operate and their impact on building owners and industry stakeholders.  This document remains available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  In summary terms, the regulations may result in additional design, inspection, certification and, possibly, insurance costs which must ultimately be borne by the building owner.  Such additional costs would be justified by the enhanced quality and standard of design and construction of the building project concerned in light of several notable instances of non-compliant buildings which failed to meet minimum building standards.  It is anticipated that the statutory inspection process will reduce the incidences of defective works on site and the resultant associated costs of carrying out remedial works will reduce accordingly.</p><p>  Owners will now be required to assign a competent registered professional to inspect and certify the works.  For buildings where this would not previously have been the case, industry sources suggest this requirement could add between &euro;1,000 to &euro;3,000 per housing unit to the overall building costs although in reality actual cost will be decided by market forces.   </p></reply>

Local Community Development Committees will be established in each local authority area over the coming months in line with the provisions in the recently enacted Local Government Reform Act 2014.  These Committees will bring together both statutory and not-statutory partners, including the community sector, to bring greater co-ordination to area-based activity in their respective areas.  The Committees will have responsibility for community and local development programmes funded by my Department and I am confident they will bring a strong, strategic focus to their implementation.  This implementation will involve local development actors and, therefore, the skills and experience that has been built up will continue to be available and utilised locally.</p><p>  In the case of the Local Community Development Programme and in accordance with public procurement rules, the Local Community and Development Committees will procure the programme locally.  While I cannot pre-empt the outcome of such a procurement process, I expect, given their experience in the area, that the Local Development Companies will apply to deliver the programme in their areas.  Changes involved in the current reform processes are challenging; however, I believe that change is necessary to ensure the optimum use of scarce resources, especially for valuable local development funding.  The process has already involved a high level of engagement with the representatives of partnership companies and this will continue as the reforms are embedded locally.</p></reply>

The recruitment process is currently underway in most local authority areas and it is anticipated that there will be 3,000 placements in local authorities by end 2014.  As Gateway is providing short-term quality and suitable work opportunities for unemployed people who are economically, educationally or socially disadvantaged while at the same time assisting in their personal, educational and social development by carrying out beneficial work within communities, &euro;2m has been allocated from the Dormant Accounts Fund , in 2014, to support the training and equipment needs of the Gateway participants placed within local authorities.

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Water Services Act 2013 provided for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the metering programme.</p><p>  The water meter installation programme commenced in August 2013 and the approved budget for the programme is &euro;539 million (excluding VAT) which includes the supply of materials and the installation work by contractors operating in eight regions.  The management of the procurement process, including the payment structure to contractors, is a matter for Irish Water.  There are four regional contractors appointed to the programme covering the eight regions nationwide.  All of the contracts were awarded in full compliance with public procurement rules.  The hiring of subcontractors is undertaken by the regional contractors in accordance with the pay and employment conditions of the contract s set out by Irish Water.  Irish Water carries out compliance checks on the contractors to ensure that they are meeting all terms.  The contracts stipulate that contractor vehicles must be in a clean and damage-free state, be coloured white with high visibility rear chevron markings and co-branded with the Irish Water logo.  This is to ensure that contractors are easily identifiable to the public for security and safety reasons.  This stipulation was clearly stated in the tender documents.  The contract s do not state that these vans need to be new.</p><p>  The contractors are responsible for the disposal of any existing material on site that cannot be reused.  This disposal must occur in accordance with their waste management plans as submitted to Irish Water and the contractors must obtain the relevant waste collection permits and waste facility permits.  The contractor&rsquo;s HSQE (Health, Safety, Quality and Environment) audit team inspect each crew on a weekly basis, and part of this audit includes verifying that waste legislation is complied with.</p></reply>

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years. It is being implemented by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) on a transitional basis for 2014 pending the roll-out of a new Programme in January 2015.  Management of contracts and Programme oversight will transfer to the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) of the Local Authorities from 1 July next. </p><p>  Local Community Development Committees will be established in each local authority area over the coming months in line with the provisions in the recently enacted Local Government Reform Act 2014. These Committees will bring together both statutory and not-statutory partners, including the community sector, to bring greater co-ordination to area-based activity in their respective areas. The Committees will have responsibility for community and local development programmes funded by my Department and I am confident they will bring a strong, strategic focus to their implementation. </p><p>  This implementation will involve local development actors and, therefore, the skills and experience that has been built up will continue to be available and utilised locally. In the case of the Local Community Development Programme and in accordance with public procurement rules, the Local Community and Development Committees will procure the programme locally. While I cannot pre-empt the outcome of such a procurement process, I expect, given their experience in the area, that the LDC will apply to deliver the programme in their areas. </p><p>  The Local Community Development Committees will comprise stakeholders from local government, local development, State agencies and the community and voluntary sector and will focus on identifying the local and community development needs and priorities for their area. They will draw up Local Economic and Community Plans that will focus on the needs of the most socially deprived communities and the means of addressing these needs especially in the context of ensuring that programmes deliver best value for the scarce resources available at this time. In this way we are strengthening the operational management, oversight and planning arrangements for local and community programmes.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Government will decide on the proposed approaches to be taken in relation to the free allowance in the near future. </p><p>  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 provides Irish Water with the power to charge for water services. The Act also provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the economic regulation of Irish water and the charges to be levied by Irish Water will be subject to the approval of the CER. The CER has already undertaken public consultations on the development of the economic regulatory framework for water services and will be undertaking further consultations during 2014. Water charges will not commence until 1 October 2014 and the first bills will be issued by Irish Water to households from January 2015. </p><p>  Group Water Schemes that are supplied by way of a connection to the public water supply network will now become customers of Irish Water, having previously been customers of the relevant local authority. Group Water Schemes that have their own water sources will not be customers of Irish Water and will continue to operate as before.   </p><p>  My Department will remain responsible for the overall policy and funding, where appropriate, of the non-public water sector, including the group water sector. Over the past decade, substantial improvements have been made in the group water sector, reflected in improved infrastructure and management and leading to greater compliance with drinking water standards. This has been accomplished through a partnership approach between my Department, the local authorities and the group water sector itself, with the important involvement of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.<i> The co-operative approach, will be maintained as the reform of water services provision is progressed.</i></p><p><i>  Responsibility for the administration of the scheme under which subsidies are paid to group water schemes towards the operational costs of supplying </i>  water for domestic use is devolved to local authorities.

The order must be made by resolution i.e. it is a reserved function of the Council, and must be confirmed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la. In March 1987, the then Minister directed Dublin County Council to make a Special Amenity Area Order for the Liffey Valley and the order was confirmed on 8 March 1990.  I am fully supportive of the protection and further enhancement of the Liffey Valley as an amenity. In 2009, my predecessor requested the relevant authorities (South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council and Kildare County Council) to consider the evaluation of lands to be the subject of a further Special Amenity Area Order for the purpose of extending the existing area to possibly include the Guinness/Farmleigh Bridge. Responses were received from these authorities and considered by my Department.</p><p>  In general, the responses received in 2009 indicated that there were insufficient grounds or funds for extending the Order beyond its existing area. Accordingly, I do not propose to issue any directions on this matter to the planning authorities concerned at this time.  In 2006, the Office of Public Works commissioned a strategy document &ldquo;Towards a Liffey Valley Park&rdquo;, which set out recommendations for the creation of a process towards the establishment of a park with a management framework for the Liffey Valley area. The matter of the implementation of these recommendations, or similar steps, is one for the local authorities concerned.</p></reply>

These are reported annually to the European Commission under the National Emissions Ceiling (NEC) Directive 200/81/EC and to the UNECE under the Gothenburg Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. The Directive and Protocol set emission ceilings that were required to be met by 2010 and must not be exceeded in any following year. The emission inventories concern emissions at national level and are not specific to individual counties.   </p><p>The most recent national emission figures, covering 2012, were published by the EPA on 6 February 2014 and can be viewed on the EPA website at ( ). These figures showed that Ireland is compliant with its emission ceilings for SO<sub>2</sub>, VOCs and NH<sub>3</sub>. However, despite significant reductions since 2005, Ireland&rsquo;s NO<sub>x</sub> emissions remain higher than the national ceiling. NO<sub>x</sub>   emissions increased between 2011 and 2012, primarily due to an increase in emissions from coal-fired electricity generation &ndash; which reflects low coal and carbon prices - and an increase in cement production. </p><p>The road transport sector continues to be the main source of NO<sub>x</sub>, responsible for over 47% of total national emissions in 2012. The contribution from road transport has been exacerbated by the underperformance of engine abatement technology (Euro standards). National estimates have shown that, if these technologies had performed to the expected standard, this would have resulted in a further 9kt reduction in NO<sub>x</sub>   emissions, which would have brought Ireland into compliance with its emission ceiling. </p></reply>

The statement also announced the standing down of all affordable housing schemes on the basis that these had been symptoms of, rather than solutions to, an overheated property market. </p><p>The policy statement reaffirms the State&rsquo;s commitment to supporting access to home ownership for lower to middle income households and the current range of paths to home ownership will remain in place in that regard.   </p><p>  There are two types of house purchase loan available from local authorities: standard annuity loans targeted at lower income first time buyers and those under the Home Choice Loan scheme which are available to qualifying middle income first time buyers affected by the &ldquo;credit crunch&rdquo;. </p><p>The terms and conditions governing the operation, including eligibility terms, of annuity mortgages and the Home Choice Loan are set out under various Regulations such as the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2009, the Housing (Home Choice Loan) Regulations 2009, and most recently in the Housing (Local Authority Loans) Regulations 2012. These are available on my Department&rsquo;s website: </p><p>  It is not the intention of the Home Choice Loan scheme &ndash; or of any other Government intervention in the housing sector &ndash; to incentivise people into the market. It is designed only to facilitate credit worthy households who have been affected by conditions in the mortgage market. </p><p>As such, the scheme is a temporary one which will be withdrawn once conditions in credit markets return to normal patterns. Recent data published by the Central Bank would indicate that that point has not yet been reached.   </p><p>To ensure effective targeting of limited resources, Local Authority loan finance continues to be available to first time buyers only.   As regards the specific scenario referred to in the question, I am aware that some homeowners who purchased properties from Local Authorities in the boom period now find that the property is no longer suitable for their changed circumstances and would wish , for example, to   move to a larger home .   The option currently available for non-first time Local Authority homeowners is to seek home loan facilities in the private sector.   </p></reply>

Where Travellers opt for Traveller-specific accommodation, local authorities are required to reflect this in their TAPs. The Social Housing Needs Assessment 2013 shows that some 2% of households on housing waiting lists, amounting to 1,632 families, opted for Traveller-specific accommodation. The requirements of all those requiring Traveller-specific accommodation will fall to be addressed in the context of the new TAP&rsquo;s for the period 2014 to 2018 which are currently being prepared by local authorities.</p><p>  There is no evidence available to me to support the view that Traveller families are being forced to accept accommodation in the private rented sector. I understand that the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, the statutory committee which advises me on a range of issues in relation to Traveller accommodation, intends to commission research later this year in relation to the accommodation of Travellers in the private rented sector. It is anticipated that this study will provide substantive data regarding the experience of Travellers who are accommodated in the sector and will also inform future policy in this regard.</p><p>  In the case of Traveller-specific accommodation, housing need can be met through the provision of new and refurbished units. It may be possible that the figures referred to in the attached correspondence relate to new units only. Significant progress has been made in the delivery of Traveller accommodation since the enactment of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998. More recently, since the adoption of the third round of TAPs in 2009, it is estimated that in excess of 450 units of Traveller-specific accommodation had been provided by end 2012, comprised of new and refurbished units. While data in respect of 2013 have yet to be finalised, it is estimated that an additional 40 units were completed in 2013. Details of the accommodation provided from 2009 &ndash; 2012 are available in the Annual Reports of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library and on my Department&rsquo;s website .</p></reply>

Provision was made in Part 2 of Schedule 2 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 for amendments to the 1999 Act to change the spending limit provisions at local elections. Section 12A of the 1999 Act was amended to set three new population bands with spending limits of &euro;13,000, &euro;11,500 and &euro;9,750, respectively.   </p><p><b>  Section 12B of </b>the 1999 Act provides that <b>the period for the reckoning of election expenses, during which the spending limits apply, is to commence between 50 and 60 days prior to polling day.

To support local authorities in this regard my Department prepares draft guidelines which local authorities may then make available.  These draft guidelines are prepared in two volumes and include the forms on which returns must be made.  One set of guidelines is concerned with the statutory obligations for candidates.  The other set deals with the statutory obligations for national agents of a political party, designated persons and third parties.  These draft guidelines are expected to issue to local authorities during this week.   </p></reply>

The Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP) is one of my Department&rsquo;s main social inclusion programmes. Its objective is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities. As part of their contractual obligations under the LCDP, funded organisations are required to submit a range of financial and other reporting documentation including annual audited accounts. The LCDP reporting requirements include overhead costs and salary costs and all documentation is inspected by the Department to ensure compliance with Programme guidelines. My Department also conducts on-site inspections to provide further assurances that the funding received is being used for the purpose intended.  Pobal also carries out audits of Local Development Companies on behalf of my Department. </p><p>  Pobal carries out the same functions in relation to Department funding under the Dormant Accounts Fund. In relation to the Scheme of Support to National Organisations and funding for the Community and Voluntary Pillar, all funded organisations are required to provide progress reports and maintain complete and accurate books of account. In addition, six monthly financial accounts are required to be submitted to the Department and organisations must have an independent firm of auditors. Full audited and certified accounts must be submitted annually, within a specified timeframe, and on-site inspections of the groups funded can take place, with access to all of the funded organisations books and records, where requested ,   by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors. </p><p>  My Department also funds a network of twenty one Volunteer Centres and associated volunteering organisations which provide a nd facilitate volunteer support s and initiatives within the community. Prior to receiving funding, each organisation must provide a detailed budget and workplan for the coming year which includes a breakdown on salaries and projected expenditure, and financial statements for the previous year demonstrating that the money was spent according to an agreed plan. Upon receipt of these documents, organisations enter into a contract with my Department which clearly states <i>inter alia</i> that funding is to be used solely for the purposes set out in the workplan as agreed with the Minister. As with other Department funded programmes and schemes, independently audited accounts are required from each funded organisation in the second half of the year for verification that money was satisfactorily spent in line with the contractually agreed workplan.   </p><p>  Under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is available for the provision of accommodation by Approved Housing Bodies to meet the needs of persons with specific categories of housing need including older people, people with an intellectual, physical or mental health disability, the homeless, returning emigrants and victims of domestic violence. The detailed administration of the scheme, including the appraisal of proposals, the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding scheme and the processing of applications for funding, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority. <font color="#1F497D">E</font> ligibility for capital grant assistance is contingent on having approved status under Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. </p><p>  With regard to homelessness services, my Department does not fund any service directly but provides funding to housing authorities towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services under Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. Housing authorities will also provide funding from their own resources. The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.   </p><p>  My Department also provides funding for the Irish Environmental Network and the Environmental Pillar which would include voluntary sector organisations. The provision of this grant funding is contingent on proper financial procedures and controls being in place which include, inter alia, that monies will be used for the intended purposes, that there is no unapproved overspend without prior consent from the Department, and that signed audited accounts are to be provided to the Department. </p><p>  The Local Agenda 21 Environmental Partnership Fund, which has operated since 1997, promotes sustainable development by assisting small-scale environmental projects at local level. These projects involve partnership arrangements between local authorities and various local groups including community groups, schools and environmental NGOs. </p><p>  The Fund encourages involvement of local communities in local action and decision-making and assists them in working towards the goal of sustainable development.  However, my Department does not fund this partnership directly but maintains a co-ordinating role and provides funding to local authorities who are responsible for the administration of the Fund.   </p><p>  My Department has no role in the internal operations of Community and Voluntary Sector organisations and, therefore, does not have a role in relation to staff or employment matters, which are for the Board of the company, as the employer, to manage.</p></reply>

The estimated annual income from the increased charges for half-yearly and quarterly vehicle licences is in the region of &euro;50 million. A loss in income from this source would have a negative impact on the Local Government Fund and consequently on grant allocations to local authorities from the Fund and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally.</p></reply>

The half-yearly and quarterly payment options incorporate a surcharge element which covers the administrative and printing costs involved in processing the higher volume of applications. In addition, reminders are issued on each renewal. The estimated annual income from the increased charges for half-yearly and quarterly vehicle licences is in the region of &euro;50m. A loss in income from this source would have a negative impact on the Local Government Fund and consequently on grant allocations to local authorities from the Fund, and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system, or through the taxation system generally.</p></reply>

The Electoral Act 2011, enacted in July 2011, allowed for a reduction in the number of TDs which will result in the number decreasing from 166 to 158 at the next general election.<b></b>It provided that the writ for a D&aacute;il bye election must now be issued within six months of the vacancy occurring.  During the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il, there were significant delays in calling by-elections. The spending limit for candidates at a Presidential election was reduced from &euro;1,300,000 to &euro;750,000. The maximum reimbursement payment to candidates was reduced from &euro;260,000 to &euro;200,000.   </p><p><b></b>The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 became law in July 2012.<b></b>This Act brought into force restrictions on corporate donations and considerable reductions in the maximum amount that a political party or an individual can accept as a political donation and provided for the following measures: <b></b></p><p>A ban on the acceptance of corporate donations over &euro;200 unless the body has registered with the Standards in Public Office Commission and <b>t</b>he donor has declared to the recipient that the donation has been authorised by a general meeting of the members of the body concerned.   </p><p>  A reduction in the limits on political donations that may be accepted:   </p><p>- by a political party from &euro;6,348.69 to &euro;2,500; </p><p>-  by an individual from &euro;2,539.48 to &euro;1,000.   </p><p>  A reduction in the thresholds at which donations must be reported to the Standard in Public Office Commission for publication:   </p><p>- by a political party or third party from &euro;5,078.95 to &euro;1,500; </p><p>-  by an individual from &euro;634.87 to &euro;600;   </p><p>  A reduction in the threshold, from &euro;5,078 to &euro;200, above which companies, trade unions, societies and building societies must report on political donations in their annual accounts.   </p><p>  A reduction in the threshold, from &euro;5,078 aggregate to &euro;1,500 aggregate, above which other donors must report donations to the Standards in Public Office Commission for publication. </p><p>  A requirement for all registered political parties to prepare independently audited accounts to be submitted annually to the Standards in Public Office Commission for publication. Political parties that do not comply with these new requirements face having their State funding withdrawn.   </p><p>  A requirement that to qualify for full State funding provided to political parties under Part 3 of the Electoral Act 1997, a qualifying political party must have at least 30% women candidates and at least 30% men candidates at the next D&aacute;il general election. This will rise to 40% after seven years. If a party does not meet these thresholds its funding will be halved.   </p><p>  As a condition for inclusion on the Register of Political Parties under Section 25 of the Electoral Act 1992, a party now has to submit:   </p><p>-  the name and address of each accounting unit of the political party, and   </p><p>-  the name and address of the responsible person or persons of the unit.   </p><p>  This information is updated annually and published. The effect of this measure will be to improve the transparency of political parties and their local structures.   </p><p>  The threshold for receipt of anonymous donations was reduced from &euro;126.97 &euro;100.   </p><p>  The donation threshold amount that triggers the requirement to open a political donations account was reduced from &euro;126.97 to &euro;100. On receipt of a donation exceeding &euro;100, a political donations account must be opened by an individual, a third party, a political party or one of its individual branches.   </p><p>  The definitions of a &lsquo;third party&rsquo; and &lsquo;accounting unit&rsquo; of a political party have been changed to provide that they become subject to the requirements in the legislation on receipt of a donation in excess of &euro;100. Previously the threshold amount was &euro;126.97. A &lsquo;third party&rsquo; must register once it receives a donation in excess of this amount.   </p><p>  A ban on the receipt of all cash donations over &euro;200. Previously there was no specific restriction on donations in cash.   </p><p>  A prohibition on anonymous indirect donations. Where a donation is given by an intermediary on behalf of somebody else, their identity must now be provided to the recipient. It is now an offence to fail to provide this information and the intermediary making the indirect donation can be prosecuted.   </p><p>  In submitting a statement of donations to the Standards in Public Office Commission, additional details must now be included to identify:   </p><p>- whether the donation was solicited;   </p><p>- the name of the person soliciting the donation and whether a receipt was given, and;   </p><p>- the date the donation was given and received.   </p><p>  In 2010 the Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption, known as &lsquo;GRECO&rsquo;, published a report on political party funding in Ireland. In December 2013, a final report on the implementation of the recommendations made by GRECO was published. It recognised that the regulation and transparency of political funding in Ireland had greatly improved and stated that   &ldquo;<i>virtually all concerns raised by GRECO have been taken on board</i>&rdquo;.   </p><p>  In February 2014 the first EU Anti-Corruption Report was published by the European Commission and notes that Ireland has tightened rules on the financing of political parties and promoted greater transparency as regards party accounts. This report also acknowledges the positive assessment given by the Council of Europe Group of States Against Corruption.   </p></reply>

This affects the Ethics Acts 1995-2001. Following the publication of the Final Report of the Mahon Tribunal in March 2012, I announced a comprehensive review of how the existing ethics legislation should be reformed to ensure a single, comprehensive legislative framework grounded on a clear and comprehensive set of principles is developed. In that context, I am considering, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, the appropriate approach to the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Moriarty and Mahon Tribunals. Drafting of the general scheme of a Bill to overhaul the current ethics framework is now at an advanced stage.</p></reply>

I do not have the detailed information in relation to the percentage pass mark as requested by the Deputy.  I have, however, been informed that some 25,000 applications were received in advance of the 9th January closing date for the current competition.  The first stages of the testing have now been completed and candidates who have qualified through these have been placed in order of merit into three bands.  Minimum qualifying scores have determined eligibility to progress from stage 1 to stage 2.</p><p>  The top 5,000 candidates from the stage 1 tests have been placed in Band 1.  These are now being called to the next stages of the competition which will also be run by PAS in association with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Candidates who are ultimately successful through all stages will be placed on a panel for entry into training in the Garda College.  A candidate who fails any stage of the process will be eliminated from the competition and will not be allowed re-enter.  It is not possible at this stage to state with any certainty how many trainees will progress from Band 1 to the Garda College as this will depend on the success rate of candidates at the next series of tests, assessments, interviews etc.  Therefore, by definition, it is not possible to say when a candidate in Band 2 might be called to progress to the next stages of the competition.  My objective is to maintain Garda strength at 13,000 and the number of trainees to be recruited will be determined taking that objective into account along with the rate of departures from the force over the coming years. It is worth noting on this point that, generally speaking, between 300 and 400 Garda&iacute; leave the Force each year.</p></reply>

The Regulations provide that a person shall be appointed for a period of three years and that the appointment is subject to such terms and conditions as I may determine with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  Mr. Oliver Connolly was appointed as Confidential Recipient with effect from 18 July 2011 for a 3 year period. The appointment followed the required consultation with the Garda Commissioner, the Garda Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Inspectorate, the Garda representative associations and the trade unions or staff associations representing civilian staff.  The terms and conditions of the appointment provided that the Confidential Recipient could resign his appointment at any time by letter addressed to myself as Minister, and that I in turn could terminate the appointment at any time by letter stating the reason for such termination. There is no requirement in the Regulations for consultation with the prescribed persons and organisations in the event that an appointment is terminated.</p><p>  Rumours were circulating for some time regarding the existence of an alleged tape and transcript of a confidential conversation between Mr. Connolly and a Garda whistleblower. Given the importance of the office&rsquo;s confidentiality, no justice minister could properly seek out such a transcript or tape.  However, following an alleged extract from the alleged tape being placed on the D&aacute;il record, I asked my Department to contact Mr. Connolly outlining my concerns that, if the conversation as reported had taken place, his actions had undermined the office of the Confidential Recipient.</p><p>  Contacts did not satisfy me as to his response to the controversy and that the Office of the Confidential Recipient would not continue to be undermined in light of this.  I wrote to him on 19 February 2014, as provided for under the terms and conditions of his appointment, and informed him that in the context of his failure to unequivocally repudiate the content of the alleged conversation or take the necessary action to restore public confidence in the office of Confidential Recipient, I believed his position was untenable and I had no alternative but to relieve him forthwith of the position.  Mr. Connolly will be paid the allowance due to him up to and including the date he was relieved from his position (19 February, 2014).  No severance or gratuity is payable.</p><p>  I have publicly said that I do not believe the office of Confidential Recipient and the legislation applicable to it is fulfilling the objective for which it was established.  The Cabinet has agreed in principle that an appropriate amendment to the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 should be prepared to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to be prescribed under that Bill as a body to which disclosures may be made by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Interim arrangements are being made to fill the Post of Confidential Recipient by the appointment of a retired judge. Every effort is being made to expedite the necessary consultation process so that the appointment can be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These regulations cover more specifically, the marketing of pesticides, the sustainable use of pesticides, the collection of statistics on pesticide use and the establishment of minimum standards for new pesticide application equipment.  These four separate regulations were commonly referred to as the &ldquo;pesticides package&rdquo;.</p><p>  Pesticide Product approval:</p><p>  The regulatory system for plant protection products is designed to ensure a very high level of protection for man, animals and the environment.  As part of the product authorisation system (Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009), risk assessments are carried out to ensure that; </p><p>(a) there are no harmful effects for spray operatives, workers, bystanders or consumers, </p><p>(b) there are no unacceptable risks to non-target species (e.g. birds, fish, wild mammals, bees or other insects, earthworms and soil macro- and micro-organisms).  </p><p>(c) surface and ground waters are protected.</p><p>  Consequently, only products that can be used safely without any unacceptable risks to man or the environment are authorised for use.</p><p>1. Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC.</p><p>2. Directive 2009/128/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides.</p><p>3. Regulation (EC) No 1185/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25th November 2009 concerning statistics on pesticides.</p><p>4. Directive 2009/127/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 amending Directive 2006/42/EC with regard to machinery for pesticide application.</p><p>  Regulating the Use phase:</p><p>  While the above mentioned regulation identifies and quantifies all risks, the Sustainable Use Directive aims to reduce these risks to human health and the environment that are associated with pesticide use.  The directive is designed to further enhance the high level of protection achieved through the entire regulatory system for pesticides.  This Directive (Directive 2009/128/EC) is transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 155 of 2012.</p><p>  This S.I. prohibits the application of pesticides from aircraft (aerial spraying) except under extenuating circumstances and only after a comprehensive and exhaustive risk assessment is carried out.  However, it should be noted that no aerial spraying has been carried out on farmland in Ireland since 1993.  On that occasion it was deemed absolutely necessary due to extreme weather conditions and it was carried out under the strict supervision of officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>  S.I. No. 155 of 2012 also requires professional users of plant protection products (farmers, landscapers, etc.) to undergo a basic level of training.  In addition, this S.I. makes it a requirement that all application equipment exceeding 3 million in working width, as well as orchard and blast sprayers, are tested by November 2016.</p><p>  While, there is no requirement for hand-held application equipment to be tested because of the low scale of use, the professional users of such equipment are required to have competed the training referred to above.  In addition, all professional users are required to apply the general principles of Integrated Pest Management from 1 January, 2014.  These principles are set out in the Directive and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have produced a helpful guide on how farmers can comply with this requirement.  Further guides will be produced in the coming months on how other categories of professional users can comply with the requirement.</p><p>  Enforcement:</p><p>  All legal requirements placed on various people through the regulations mentioned above will be monitored and measured by officials from my Department.  This includes inspection at farm level under Statutory Management Requirement No. 10 (plant protection products) but also inspections at retail and wholesale premises that sell plant protection products.</p><p>  Statutory Instrument No. 155 of 2012 allows for penalties ranging from a &ldquo;Fixed Payment Notice&rdquo; of &euro;250 to prosecution through the court system.  Where a breach is detected at farm level a disallowance through the Single Payment Scheme may also apply.</p></reply>

The white fish and inshore fleets have been particularly affected.  As the catching sector is by definition dependant on being able to go out and catch fish, and crews earn their living through a share of the catch, many fishermen have suffered financially because of this extended period restricted to port.  We have had some breaks in the weather during February and many of the vessels that were harbour bound due to the severe weather were able to return to fishing and to some extent make up for lost time.  No doubt we will continue to have intermittent stormy conditions in the weeks and months ahead, as is normal for this time of year, but I am hopeful that fishermen will be able to put to sea on a regular basis so that they can put that difficult period behind them.</p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in all sectors who have been unable to work because of adverse weather conditions.  As income from fishing is derived from landings of catch, the amount that can be caught and therefore the income from most fisheries is determined by the EU quotas which are restrictive, and made available under our management arrangements with catch limits set for whitefish each month.  The quotas are managed to allow for access to quota for the full twelve months of the year, as far as possible.  This may mean in many cases that the allocations made available for certain months are set at low levels, certainly less than Industry would like and would be capable of landing.</p><p>  I always work very closely with, and I am advised by industry when setting catch limits during the year.  Each month, a quota management advisory committee, involving Industry representatives and my Department, meets and examines available quota, uptake levels and the market situation and make recommendations to me on catch limits for the following month.  The quota uptake figures for January 2014 and for the first part of February are significantly down.  In order that vessel owners and their crews are enabled to compensate as early as possible for these low catch levels, allocations for March were set for a number of the key economic stocks at a higher level than in February.  The level recommended by industry took account of concerns not to glut the market with very high landings in a single month and on that basis the arrangements recommended and put in place involve modest increases in key whitefish stocks including cod, haddock and whiting in the Celtic Sea, monkfish and megrim in the Celtic Sea and the hake stock in the Celtic Sea and the north west.  These increased quotas and fishing opportunities for March will help to re-balance the landings to bring them more into line with planned annual spread of quota uptake.  They can be further adjusted in April to take into account of the low level of landings in the first six weeks of the year.</p></reply>

The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is currently the most technologically advanced test for initial detection of verotoxigenic <i>E.coli</i>  , known as VTEC. PCR is a rapid screening test and is now the official ISO method used for the initial detection of food borne VTEC. The PCR testing method was recently introduced in some Health Service Executive (HSE) laboratories for this purpose. It was first used by my Department for testing raw milk cheese in July 2013. </p><p>  VTEC, if present, poses a significant health risk, particularly for children, pregnant women and elderly people. The major advantage of the PCR method over the traditional immunomagnetic separation methodology is its ability to detect all toxin producing serogroups of VTEC and therefore it provides better protection of consumer health. As more <i>E.coli</i> have taken on the genetic material that enables them to produce the toxin that can cause illness, what was once a problem confined to VTEC O157 is now much wider, with many other VTEC serogroups becoming a threat to human health (e.g. O26, O111, O103, O104 etc). The PCR testing method can detect all <i>E.coli</i> that have a gene that codes for toxin production, not just those for <i>E.coli</i>   O157. It is used as a screening test only. Where a positive is found using PCR, the laboratory then attempts to isolate and grow the specific bacteria before the presence of VTEC can be confirmed. </p><p>  Under EU Regulations, the onus is on every food business operator (FBO) in Ireland, as in every other Member State, to put measures in place to produce safe food. Risk assessments are carried out annually. The level of sampling required is based on the results of this risk analysis and compliance history. </p><p>  My Department does not currently carry out routine PCR testing on raw milk cheese produced by Irish cheese makers, or on imported cheeses made from raw milk.  Imported cheese is tested at retail level by the HSE either as part of a national survey or in the course of routine sampling.</p><p>  However, during 2013, PCR testing was carried out in two cases where an identified risk existed. In one case, raw milk cheese previously made by the producer involved was associated with a food-borne outbreak of VTEC and in the other there was previous evidence of potential contamination of the raw milk with VTEC. In both cases the initial PCR screening indicated VTEC contamination, and critically, this was confirmed by subsequent isolation of VTEC in the cheese concerned.  </p><p>  While there is no specific legal requirement for cheese producers to test cheese for VTEC, EU Regulations require FBOs to produce safe food, to identify food safety hazards in the food they produce, to identify measures to control these hazards and to verify that these controls are working. One such measure of verification is microbiological testing.</p><p>  EU Regulations explicitly require Competent Authorities within Member States to assess FBOs&rsquo; food safety management systems and again microbiological sampling can be used for this purpose. Such sampling may be done to test for certain pathogens for which legal criteria have been set in Regulation 2073 of 2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs. Sampling may also be done to test for a pathogen for which no criterion is set but which is a hazard that is associated with a particular food (e.g. VTEC and raw milk cheese). </p><p>  Member States are also required to investigate food-borne outbreaks and to periodically monitor for pathogens that could be passed from animals to humans through foods of animal origin by sampling animals, food and feed, as appropriate. VTEC is an example of such a micro-organism, as it is associated with cattle and is known to periodically contaminate raw milk. </p><p>  I regard food safety as the platform upon which the Irish agri food sector is built, and in this regard my Department will continue to fulfil its statutory obligations and to maintain the highest standards using the best available technology to ensure that Irish food maintains its deserved reputation for safety and quality.  </p></reply>

There are two issues here: </p><p>(1) If a farmer had an area designated in his REPS plan as a habitat he is required to leave it intact for the duration of the REPS contract. This area is eligible for a payment under both REPS and SPS. When the REPS period of a farmer, who had declared a REPS 3 or REPS 4 new habitat expires, he or she has the possibility of declaring that habitat as a &ldquo;Designated Habitat&rdquo;. This means that if the habitat is maintained, the area will continue to be eligible for payment under the Single Payment Scheme. </p><p>(2) Outside of habitat areas listed on the REPS plan there is a requirement that the remaining land will be maintained in GAEC (good agricultural and environmental condition) which includes ensuring there is no encroachment of scrub. If the area outside the habitat area is found to have reverted to scrub because, for example, of failure to maintain the land in GAEC, it will not be eligible for payment under SPS.

In this context, Ireland received a positive narrative, particularly in the area of accompanying measures. The report noted that   <i>&ldquo;research conducted in Ireland demonstrates that their Food Dudes Programme, which is based on strong accompanying measures, is essential for a sustainable increase in children&rsquo;s fruit and vegetable consumption.

However, its report enumerates recommendations from various evaluations, including by external consultants, which were put forward to the Commission. These included higher EU co-financing, aiming at a sustained distribution for 35 school weeks or more, diversity of offer (at least 5 to 10 different products), continued distribution free of charge, high frequency of offering, ideally three times a week, extending the target group, reducing the administrative burden, encouraging more accompanying measures and making these eligible for EU aid.  Some of these recommendations were adopted in the context of CAP Reform i.e. increasing the budget and the rates of EU co-financing and making accompanying measures eligible for co-financing under certain conditions.  </p><p>  In Ireland the EU school fruit /Food Dudes scheme uses the principles of repeat tasting together with rewards and the use of role models in the form of Food Dudes characters to encourage primary schoolchildren to develop a taste for fruit and vegetables.  The focus is on presenting an attractive package to children to encourage consumption of fruit and vegetables in a way which appeals to them, rather than on simply making fruit and vegetables available over a prolonged period.  Published studies have shown that this is effective in achieving a sustained increase in consumption of fruit and vegetables and Ireland received a World Health Organisation award.  The repeat tasting of four fruit and four vegetables over a period of 16 days gives schoolchildren an opportunity to develop a taste for a variety of fruit and vegetables. </p><p>  Surveys of parents and teachers show satisfaction rates of over 90% and an evaluation in 2011 showed primary schoolchildren bringing on average 20% more fruit and 42% more vegetables to school in their lunchboxes and consuming them. </p><p>  In the context of the reformed CAP and other emerging Commission proposals, and following the completion of the National roll out of the current programme in 2014, my Department will be examining a follow on Food Dudes programme in due course. </p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s investment is a strong vote of confidence in the suckler beef sector.

This will provide for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers, and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions, </p><p>  - continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now Areas of Natural Constraint), to the tune of about &euro;195 million per year, </p><p>  - incentives for on-farm capital investment, </p><p>  - knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions, including the beef sector, </p><p>  - a beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year aimed at improving the genetic quality of the beef herd,  and</p><p>  - other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers, organic farming, etc.</p><p>  Suckler farmers will be able to apply for any or all of these measures over the lifetime of the programme, as suits their particular enterprise, once the draft RDP has been approved. In keeping with the timelines agreed at EU level, it is intended to submit a draft of the new RDP to the European Commission in the second quarter of 2014. This draft will then form the basis for detailed discussions over a number of months with the European Commission. </p></reply>

HRI&rsquo;s remit is confined exclusively under legislation to the development, promotion and welfare of the thoroughbred horse. The Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, Section 8 (e) states that the general functions of HRI include &quot;the provision of any financial and other support it deems appropriate to maintain and improve the health and welfare status of the thoroughbred horse ...&quot; The Irish Equine Centre carries out an important role in the protection against potentially devastating equine diseases, HRI supports the centre by providing a substantial annual grant.    </p><p>  HRI continues its direct support for the Irish Horse Welfare Trust (IHWT) which seeks to re-home and re-train thoroughbreds no longer active in racing.  </p><p>  HRI&rsquo;s existing general welfare policy is reflected in the <i>&lsquo;Promoting Responsible Thoroughbred Ownership&rsquo;</i>   document to which they subscribed along with the other bodies concerned with welfare within the horse racing and breeding industry.</p><p>  I am committed to equine welfare and the Deputy will be aware that my Department devotes considerable resources to issues relating to horse welfare.  My Department paid over &euro;3m to the Local Authorities in 2013 to assist in their work under the Control of Horses Act,  removing in excess of 4,500 stray or unwanted horses and resolving a number of serious horse welfare situations.</p><p>  In addition, in December 2013, I announced increased funding of &euro;1.8m to 136 organisations involved in animal care and welfare services throughout the country to support their activities in 2014. </p><p>  In that context increased funding was concentrated on horses to enable those welfare bodies dealing with horses cater for any difficulties arising in the area of horse welfare during 2014 and to assist them in complying with new legislation on equine identification and equine premises registration.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that any proposal to impose a levy would require State Aids approval from the European Commission, even though state monies would not be involved. I am mindful that any such levy would have to apply to all equines, there would be huge issues regarding collection and enforcement. The imposition of a levy would increase the cost of horse ownership further  and thereby could exacerbate rather than relieve the problem. </p><p>  Finally, it should of course be pointed out that while the State and its agencies have made a significant contribution to equine welfare, none of the initiatives outlined above abrogates the primary responsibility of the keeper of the animal in relation to the welfare of horses in his or her care. </p></reply>

The new (RDP) will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas. As you are aware I have recently published a consultation document on the new RDP, which sets out a range of proposed measures for inclusion.</p><p>  The main areas proposed for support in the new RDP are:</p><p>  - a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS. This will provide for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers, and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions, </p><p>  - continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now Areas of Natural Constraint), to the tune of about &euro;195 million per year, </p><p>  - incentives for on-farm capital investment, </p><p>  - knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions, </p><p>  - a new beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year aimed at improving the genetic quality of the beef herd, and</p><p>  - other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers, organic farming etc.</p><p>  In response to the open call for written submissions on the proposed measures, over 120 written submissions were received by the deadline of 19 February. Following examination of these submissions, an ex-ante evaluation incorporating a Strategic Environmental Analysis and an Appropriate Assessment will be carried out on the proposed RDP measures by independent, external evaluators. This process will involve a further stage of stakeholder consultation.</p><p>  In keeping with the timelines agreed at EU level, it is intended to submit a draft of the new RDP to the European Commission in the second quarter of 2014. This draft will then form the basis for detailed discussions over a number of months with the European Commission. </p></reply>

The Scheme aims to support the diversification of the economies of traditional fishing communities to help maintain people and jobs in these areas.  The Scheme is co-funded by the Exchequer and the European Fisheries Fund.  </p><p>  Six Fisheries Local Action Groups covering the entirety of the Irish coastline have been established as part of the Scheme.  Following a lengthy process of consultation and analysis of the economic needs of their respective FLAG territories, the six FLAGs developed their respective Local Development Strategies over the past two years and five of the six have been published on the BIM website, with the final one to follow shortly.  These Local Development Strategies guide the work of the FLAGs in selecting development projects in their areas to support.  </p><p>  The FLAGs have no direct role in relation to management of fisheries.  However, in preparing their strategies, FLAGs can identify challenges which affect their stakeholders, including in relation to exploitation of fisheries, which warrant a strategic response and outline projects or measures which the FLAG will support for the benefit of their stakeholders.  I understand that each of the five published strategies has identified projects or measures which relate to the exploitation of inshore stocks.  In that regard I see great potential in the FLAGs to support small scale coastal fishermen and their communities for whom inshore fisheries are a critical part of their livelihood.</p><p>  In relation to a national management strategy for inshore fisheries, Food Harvest 2020 recommended the implementation of a specific Inshore Fisheries Management framework should proceed as speedily as possible, to allow sustainable management of high value inshore stocks, consistent with conservation requirements.  My policy priority for inshore fisheries is to bring management of inshore fisheries into full compliance with the Habitats and Birds Directives and with the judgement of the European Court of Justice in case C418/04.  This is a necessary precursor to developing national inshore fisheries management plans and will also support sustainable development of inshore fisheries into the future.  </p><p>  This year is likely to be highly significant one for inshore fisheries, particularly in relation to the Habitats and Birds Directives.  The Marine Institute is presently preparing risk assessments under article 6 of the Habitats Directive in respect of all fisheries in or adjacent to all marine Natura 2000 sites.  I expect to receive the Marine Institute&rsquo;s reports on these assessments in the coming months.  Where mitigation responses are required to ensure the protection of designated habitats and species, it will be necessary for all stakeholders, particularly the fishing industry and its representatives, to contribute to the development of effective mitigation responses.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the priority afforded to the Birds and Habitats issues, in late 2013, my Department engaged in a lengthy period of consultation with lobster and shrimp fishermen on the need for additional conservation measures to ensure the sustainability of the lobster and shrimp fisheries.  The in-excess of 200 submissions received raised many important issues which are currently under consideration.  </p></reply>

These include a British consumer preference for indigenous product as well as additional transport and processing costs in supplying that market. Ireland&rsquo;s trade with Britain accounts for 53% of our beef export volumes and, at around 250,000 tonnes in 2013, is equivalent to 750,000 cattle with a high level of penetration in the multiple retail sector. </p><p>  One of the main difficulties in marketing young bulls older than 16 months is that these animals are outside the specifications preferred by the UK market. This is a major disadvantage at present because the UK market has effectively become the highest-priced beef market in the EU.</p><p>The potential to grow the live trade to Britain is also constrained by the labelling system operated by the retail chains in relation to cattle born in this country and exported live for finishing and processing in the UK. The retailers&rsquo; longstanding policy is to market British and Irish beef separately. This means that beef must be sourced from animals originating in one country; i.e. born, reared and slaughtered in the same country. In addition, logistical difficulties arise when a small number of Irish-born animals are slaughtered in a UK meat plant. Under mandatory EU labelling rules, these carcases have to be deboned in a separate   batch, packaged and labelled accordingly, thereby incurring additional costs for the processor. </p><p>  While Bord Bia has repeatedly raised the labelling issue with British retailers over the years, there are no indications that their marketing policy is likely to be reversed soon. Nevertheless, Bord Bia in its ongoing interactions with British customers will continue to pursue all opportunities, including any change in labelling policies, to maximise the full potential of the beef and livestock trade with our largest trading partner.</p><p>  In relation to allegations of anti-competitive practices by the meat plants either in Ireland or the United Kingdom, I would suggest that if the Deputy has information to substantiate such charges he should address them directly to the Competition Authority in Ireland and its equivalent body in the UK, the Competition Commission, who are the appropriate bodies to investigate these matters.</p></reply>

This proposal follows the commitment in the Programme for Government that criminal sanctions for minor fisheries offences would be replaced with an administrative sanction scheme. Following advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that an administrative sanction scheme would not be appropriate, I am now seeking to introduce a system of Fixed Penalty Notices in respect of minor fisheries offences. The intention is that fishermen who have committed relatively minor fisheries offences will have the option of avoiding a criminal conviction.</p><p>  The Government is committed to introducing a fixed Penalty notice system, clearly, such a system must conform to EU law and be constitutional.  Discussions have taken place with the Attorney General on the use of the Road Traffic Act as a model.  Formal legal advice is awaited from the Attorney General to allow the preparation of a Bill on this basis and which will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment, within the parameters of the Constitution and EU requirements.</p></reply>

In light of the additional funds now available, on 18 February my Department invited applications for funding from Local Authorities in respect of repair to fishery and aquaculture related harbours, piers and slipways damaged in the recent storm events.  In relation to inshore fishermen, BIM has opened for applications, a new scheme providing aid of up to &euro;2,400 for the replacement of pots lost in the storms. The Deputy will agree that these are significant interventions in the current economic circumstances and are a clear indication of this Government's commitment to assisting rural coastal communities and the inshore fishing sector with their recovery from the storms.</p><p>  In relation to any specific payments to compensate for lost earnings, the Minister for Social Protection has overall responsibility for funding income support to individuals and families in all sectors who have been unable to work because of adverse weather conditions.    </p><p>  While the EU co-legislators have reached political agreement on the proposed Regulation establishing the EMFF, it will not be adopted in law by the EU institutions until probably June this year.  Distribution of the EMFF amongst Member States has not yet been determined by the EU Commission and pending that Ireland has been allocated no specific funding under the EMFF at this point.  My Department is working to prepare a new 7-year Operational Programme for the seafood sector under the EMFF.  That Programme is dependent on the progress of the proposed Regulation and so is likely to be finalised towards the end of the year.  Decisions on what to do with the finite resources available to Ireland under that Operational Programme will be a key element of that work and I am working closely with all stakeholders in making those hard choices between many competing and worthwhile investment priorities.  It is thus premature to consider employing EMFF funds at this early stage in the development of the Operational Programme.</p></reply>

It is one of our largest non-EU markets and the strong 2013 sales performance contributed greatly to the rise in value of overall pigmeat exports by 3% in 2013 to &euro;525m.  It is hugely important therefore that the current ban by Russia on the importation of pigs and pigmeat from the EU be lifted as quickly as possible. </p><p>  In January 2014 the Lithuanian authorities discovered two cases of African Swine Fever (ASF) in wild boar near its border with Belarus. They put in place the required disease control measures and informed fellow member states and the EU Commission of the outbreak.  The EU Commission, as competent authority for agreeing sanitary and phytosanitary matters on behalf of EU member states, informed the OIE ( the international organisation for animal health). </p><p>  The EU Commission proposed, under Chapter 4 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, to provisionally exclude the affected region in Lithuania from exporting pigs and pigmeat to other countries including Russia, thereby &ldquo;regionalising&rdquo; the outbreak and allowing EU Member States not affected by the disease to trade freely in live pigs, pigmeat and pigmeat products.  </p><p>  The value of the Terrestrial Code is twofold; the measures published in it are the result of consensus among the veterinary authorities of OIE members, and it constitutes a reference within the World Trade Organisation Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures as an international standard for animal health and zoonoses.  </p><p>  However, the Russian Federation and Customs Union refused to accept regionalisation of the disease and imposed a ban on all exports of pigs, pigmeat and pigmeat products from the EU, certified after 26 January 2013. Since then Poland notified the EU Commission of an outbreak of ASF in its territory. </p><p>  Numerous meetings between the EU and the Russian Federation have taken place at political and technical level in the intervening period, in attempts to unblock the situation, but without success to date.  On Friday last, 28 February EU Health Commissioner Toni Borg met with Russian Farm Minister Nikoiai Fyodorov in Moscow and additional technical briefings are being organised for this week,  including a postponed meeting of experts from the EU, Russia, Belarus &amp;amp; Kazakhstan at the Russian African Swine Fever reference laboratory; which was originally scheduled for last week.  </p><p>  Talks on the resumption of market access will continue next week with another high-level meeting between Director General for the EU Commission (DG SANCO), Paolo Testori Coggi and her Russian counterpart Sergey Dankvert, Head of Rosselkhoznadzor - the Veterinary and Phytosanitary Service in Moscow. In addition, Member State veterinary experts will discuss the latest ASF developments when they meet in Brussels today and tomorrow (4 and 5 March). </p><p>  I am in agreement with the EU Commission that the ban is disproportionate as it does not respect the OIE rules on regionalisation. The Commission services are currently considering instigating a WTO panel action against the Russian Federation for its non-respect of the regionalisation provision.</p><p>  I spoke on the matter at the Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels last week and I confirmed that Ireland supports the Commission approach to protecting the OIE based regionalisation approach to managing animal disease outbreaks. I urged fellow Member States to continue to act as one on this issue and to show support for the Commission`s approach to dealing with the current difficulty.  </p><p>  I also highlighted the fact that time is running out for producers and processors in the EU and I encouraged the Commission to step up its efforts to find a solution soon. This solution needs to bring to an end to this unnecessary blanket ban on EU product while assuring the continued protection of the EU against the threat of animal disease.</p><p>  Since then the EU Health Commissioner has written to me and my Council colleagues urging us to remain resolute in our support for the Commission strategy in seeking a solution which does not compromise the internationally accepted rules on regionalisation.</p><p>  My Department officials are working closely with industry representatives at home and   keeping them apprised of developments.</p><p>  On a positive note the Russian Federation recently agreed to lift the ban on finished product containing pork subject to certain conditions and treatment of the meat before export.  This however accounts for only a small proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s exports to Russia.</p></reply>

Despite continued slow demand from some key export markets, prices for prime steers and heifers have remained relatively stable even though the combined kill for these categories has increased by 10% in the first eight weeks of 2014 compared to same period in 2013. While the young bull trade is challenging at present as age and weight issues continue to adversely affect demand, the number of young bulls slaughtered at DAFM-approved plants has increased steadily since the start of 2014, from an average of 4,700 head in the first three weeks to an average of 6,600 head over weeks six to eight.</p><p>  Higher factory throughput is partly a result of cattle becoming fit for slaughter earlier than in previous years leading to a situation whereby factories are giving preference to certain types of stock that are better suited to the trade specifications demanded by their retail customers. The Irish beef industry is highly export dependent and the need to ensure that it is producing efficiently for overseas markets cannot be ignored. Finished cattle prices continue to be impacted by weak demand, particularly for manufacturing beef, in key export markets. One of the main difficulties in marketing young bulls over 16 months at age is that these animals are outside the specifications preferred by the UK market. This is a major disadvantage at present because the UK market has effectively become the highest-priced beef market in the EU.</p><p>  Although I have no function in relation to commercial transactions between the meat factories and their suppliers, I recently met representatives of both sides to discuss the current situation. As a result of that interaction, I am hopeful that the factories, in collaboration with the farming bodies, will be able to resolve the various issues that have lately caused difficulties for some producers. At my request, Meat Industry Ireland (MII) member companies have kept their livestock offices open to deal with farmers with any particular queries or concerns on the marketing of their stock.  MII member companies have made available contact details for each their main plants to enable farmers to phone them directly.</p><p>  The relationship between processors and farmers is an interdependent one. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of both sides working together to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. The current situation clearly underlines the need for industry operators to improve communication on market trends and signals throughout the supply chain. An industry-led solution to the current uncertainty is essential to restoring confidence in the sector and I would encourage the various stakeholders to continue their efforts to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.</p><p>  To support the beef sector I recently announced the operational details of an investment package worth up to &euro;40m to beef farmers in 2014. Among the measures in this investment  package are  &euro;23m for a Beef Genomics Scheme, &euro;10m for the Beef Data Programme, &euro;5m for the Beef Technology Adoption Programme and &euro;2m in residual payments under the Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme. The Government&rsquo;s investment is a strong vote of confidence in the suckler beef sector. It exemplifies the smart, green growth initiatives envisioned in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and, coupled with additional support measures under the new Rural Development Programme, will underpin the development of a sustainable beef sector with long-term growth potential.</p></reply>

Therefore, lands afforested during the period 2005 to 2008 were not and cannot now become eligible for payment under the Single Payment Scheme. However, provision was made in the Regulations whereby farmers, who afforested part of their holding under the Afforestation Aid Scheme, could consolidate their entitlements on the reduced number of eligible hectares that they farmed. That meant that farmers could benefit from full payment under both the Single Payment Scheme and Afforestation Aid Scheme. Many farmers in Ireland, who afforested part of their holdings, took advantage of these provisions.   </p><p>  Following changes to the EU Regulations arising from the adoption of the CAP Health Check proposals, land which was afforested since 2009 is eligible to draw down a payment under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS), provided that the afforested land meets the following requirements:</p><p> - The land to be afforested was declared on a 2008 SPS application form;</p><p> - The applicant who declared that land on a 2008 SPS application form was paid under the 2008 Single Payment Scheme;</p><p> - The afforested was eligible for payment in 2008;</p><p> - The afforested land meets all the requirements of the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme.</p><p>  Similar provisions covering the eligibility of afforested land are contained in Regulation (EU) 1307/2013 governing the requirements of the Basic Scheme, which will replace the Single Payment Scheme from 2015 onwards.</p></reply>

The new legislative provisions allow, inter alia, for the imposition of new qualification requirements for staff working in early years services.  </p><p>  I am now introducing a requirement for all staff working directly with children in pre-school services to have a full FETAC Level 5 Award in early childhood care and education, with effect from September 2014 in the case of new services and from September 2015 in the case of existing services.  I will also be increasing the existing minimum requirement under the free Pre-school Year Programme for Pre-School Leaders to hold a full FETAC Level 5 award in early childhood care and education to a full FETAC Level 6 award.  </p><p>  My Department is currently putting arrangements in place for a new training programme, the Learner Programme.  Planning is underway in association with Pobal to seek expressions of interest from accredited training providers who wish to provide FETAC Level 5 or Level 6 training under this initiative.   Funding of &euro;3 million will be available to this Fund during 2014/2015.  It is likely that the City and County Childcare Committees will play an important role in identifying qualifying staff and supporting them in accessing suitable training from the panel put in place through the expressions of interest process.  I expect the full details, including detailed specifications, selection criteria and operational arrangements for the new initiative, to be finalised and announced shortly.</p></reply>

Approximately 68,000 children availed of the provision in the 2012/2013 academic year, and similar numbers are expected to avail of it during the current academic year.</p><p>  Despite the challenging budgetary situation, I have succeeded in maintaining the pre-school year as a universal and free programme, ensuring that a significant number of children can avail of quality pre-school services who would not otherwise be in a position to do so.</p><p>  There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence which quantify the benefits of early years interventions in terms of improving children&rsquo;s outcomes and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the state. In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.  A second free pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and would be likely to generate 4,000-5,000 new jobs, albeit mostly part-time. </p><p>  However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not presently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  My Pre-School Quality Agenda, which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.</p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education are being considered as part of the preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy.  The report of the Expert Advisory Group which I appointed to advise on recommendations for inclusion in the Strategy, &lsquo;Right from the Start&rsquo;, sets out a wide range of recommendations for consideration and will contribute substantially to the final draft of the Early Years Strategy.  One of the recommendations in the Report for consideration in the preparation of the Strategy is to extend the free pre-school provision, but only after achieving higher quality standards, more investment in training and mentoring, and professionalization of the Early Years workforce.</p></reply>

Decisions on statutory charges for health services will be  a matter for Government, and will only be undertaken when full costings on UHI are available.</p></reply>

If an applicant&rsquo;s means are above the financial thresholds, as outlined in the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE routinely considers whether the refusal of eligibility will result in undue financial hardship for the applicant or any dependants.  Eligibility may be granted, on a discretionary basis, if the applicant cannot arrange general practitioner, medical and surgical services, for themselves and their dependants, without undue financial hardship. </p><p>  Medical card applicants or their dependants who submit supporting medical reports with an application for a medical card and who do not qualify for a medical card on  means grounds, have the management of their medical condition considered during the assessment process to determine if the refusal of eligibility would result in undue financial hardship for the applicant or any dependants.</p></reply>

Following reports to the Irish Medicines Board of narcolepsy cases among children and adolescents who were vaccinated with Pandemrix, a retrospective population based study was conducted and led by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  The report of the National Narcolepsy Study Steering Committee was published on 19th April 2012 and is available on my Departments website (www.dohc.ie).</p><p>  The HSE and the Department of Education and Skills continue to provide a range of services and supports to individuals diagnosed with narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination regardless of age, on an ex-gratia basis.  These services and supports which are co-ordinated by the HSE National Advocacy Unit are intended to provide that individuals receive tailored assistance to address their specific requirements, where appropriate.  It is acknowledged that treatment and individual medical needs may need to be reassessed over time to take account of changes in their condition or circumstances.  </p><p>  The ex-gratia health supports include clinical care pathways to ensure access to rapid diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary assessments led by clinical experts, counselling services for both the individuals and their families, discretionary medical cards for those who have been diagnosed have been provided to allow unlimited access to GP care and any prescribed medication, ex-gratia reimbursement of vouched expenses incurred in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including travel expenses for attending medical appointments; physiotherapy, occupational therapy assessments, dental  assessments and dietary services all on a needs basis.  Regional co-ordinators have been appointed to assist individuals to provide advice, information and access to local services.</p><p>  On the education side, the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) engaged with all of the schools being attended by children with narcolepsy to provide guidance and assistance on the condition and the supports available.  These include special education home tuition, the provision of supplemental learning support/resource teaching support on a needs basis and the provision of Special Needs Assistants (SNA) support if required.  Furthermore, reasonable accommodations, including special examination centres and rest breaks were provided for students who sat state exams in last June.  Similar arrangements will be available on a needs basis to students sitting state exams in future years.  The Department of Education and Skills issued circulars providing information to schools on the nature, likely symptoms, possible effect of the condition of narcolepsy on students and the supports available for students.</p><p>  With regard to third level, students diagnosed with narcolepsy following pandemic vaccination can access the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) scheme, which is a college/university scheme which offers enhanced access routes to third level education.</p><p>  All health and educational services and supports will continue to be provided on an ex-gratia basis.  Those services and supports will be reassessed on an ongoing basis to take account of the individual's condition and circumstances.</p></reply>

The advance healthcare directive has been recognised as an expression of an individual&rsquo;s autonomy and as a useful tool in enabling the individual to maintain some level of control over medical treatment into the future, when he or she lacks the capacity to express autonomous preferences. </p><p>  There is currently no specific legislation pertaining to advance healthcare directives in Ireland. The establishment of a statutory mechanism of advanced healthcare planning will bring clarity to individuals and their attending healthcare professionals regarding the individual&rsquo;s will and preferences for future treatment. Given the increased focus on a more patient-centred model of healthcare, more and more people will wish to play an active role in their treatment decisions, even when they no longer retain capacity to do so. Advance healthcare directives are an important tool in this regard.</p><p>  On Tuesday 4<sup>th</sup> February 2014, the Government approved the publication of the draft General Scheme of the advance healthcare directive provisions for the purposes of a public consultation. This consultation process is scheduled to conclude by Friday 7<sup>th</sup> March 2014. Following the consultation process the advance healthcare directive provisions are to be incorporated into the <i>Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill</i> at Committee Stage, in line with a Government decision from 2013. It is envisaged that the Bill will be brought to Committee Stage in the coming months.</p><p>  Given the intersection between the aims of the capacity legislation and the role of advance healthcare directives, the <i>Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill</i> 2013 is considered to be the most appropriate vehicle for providing a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives. Incorporating provisions for advance healthcare directives into the capacity legislation represents an efficient and practical method of consolidating the law in this area.</p></reply>

The legislation requires a person to notify the HSE of any change in their circumstances, such as income, expenditure, medical or social issues, which disentitles them to a medical card. In practice, very few people do so. As a result, the HSE has an obligation to take measures to ensure that the medical card register is as accurate as possible and that its voted budget is being spent appropriately in the medical card scheme. </p><p>  All card holders, irrespective of the basis on which the card was awarded, may be subject to a periodic review of eligibility to determine continuing eligibility. Each person eligible to a medical or GP visit card receives a plastic card on which a &quot;valid to&quot; date is printed. This is the latest date that a review may be conducted in respect of that person. Notwithstanding the &quot;valid to&quot; date printed on the card, the HSE reserves the right to review eligibility at any time and to take appropriate action in circumstances where the cardholder no longer fulfils the criteria for eligibility under the medical card-GP visit card national assessment guidelines. </p><p>  Persons who have been granted a medical card under the financial hardship provisions of the medical card scheme are required, when the subject of a review assessment, to submit all relevant and up-to-date details. This is necessary so that the HSE can make a correct determination of continuing eligibility. Where an applicant indicates on a review application that medical evidence has been previously submitted relating to a life-long medical condition, and this has been confirmed by the HSE, the HSE will not request further medical evidence in this regard. The applicant will, however, be required to submit all other information material to a review assessment.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to the provision and development of services for these children, having regard to available resources. </p><p>  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s <i>National Review of Autism Services: Past, Present and Way Forward Report</i> (2012) and its <i>National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)</i> set out the overall policy context for the provision of autism services to children and young people.  The objective of the Progressing Disability Services Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services.  This Programme, when implemented, should mean greater equity in accessing services, based on need, clearer referral pathways to these services and improved collaboration between the relevant sectors.  An additional &euro;4m has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.  </p><p>  The specific issue of access by children with autism to speech and language therapy services is an operational matter for the HSE.  Accordingly I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The decision to commence the roll-out with this age cohort is in accordance with the recommendation in <i>Right from the Start</i>, the Report of the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy.  Universal screening and surveillance services are already made available for children in this age cohort.  Evidence suggests that a high-quality primary care system with universal access will achieve better outcomes for young children. </p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation.  The necessary administrative arrangements will be made when the specifics of the legislation are known.</p><p>A public consultation process started on 31<sup>st</sup> January 2014 relating to the content and scope of a new GP contract to underpin the provision of GP care, free at the point of use, for all children aged under six years.  I met with key stakeholders on 31<sup>st</sup> January - the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP), the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) and the National Association of General Practitioners (NAGP) &ndash; to brief them on Government policy concerning the introduction of a universal GP service without fees and in particular, on the first phase concerning children under 6 years.</p><p>  I wish to take this opportunity again to reiterate that the document which was put out for consultation is a <i>draft</i>  .  I am aware that GPs have raised a number of concerns, including the resourcing of general practice and the need for meaningful negotiation with the GP representative bodies.  </p><p>  General Practice is resourced through a range of payments to GPs under various contracts, including the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.  In 2013, GMS fees and allowances paid to GPs totalled in the region of &euro;453 million and GPs also generate funds through private practice.  The Government is also providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of providing GP care, free at the point of use, for all children aged under six years.</p><p>  It is my intention to meet with the GP representative bodies in the coming weeks for detailed discussions on the scope and content of the draft contract.  This will afford them the fullest opportunity to raise any and all issues which they may have regarding the draft contract, including concerns about their compliance with the Medical Practitioners Act, professional competence and other laws governing GPs.  It will also enable them to make their own proposals as to how the draft contract may be improved.  Consequently, I have no doubt that there will be changes to the text of the draft contract following the consultation process.</p><p>  On 27<sup>th</sup> February 2014, I wrote to the IMO stating that the Department and the HSE are fully prepared to engage meaningfully with them and are prepared to negotiate with them on all aspects of the scope and content of the proposed contract.  However, the ultimate setting of fees must remain a matter for the Minister for Health, though there will be an opportunity for their input on this aspect, and on the fee structure, which it is proposed to address by means of a separate consultation process.  I have formally invited the IMO to meet with the Department and the HSE to commence this process during this week or on another mutually agreeable date if this week does not suit. </p><p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question about ministerial involvement in the drafting of the contract, my ministerial colleagues in the Department of Health and I have not personally written any part of the draft contract; however, I as Minister of State for Primary Care have overseen the development of the draft contract.</p></reply>

In order to harmonise regulation of e-cigarettes across EU Member States, the new Tobacco Products Directive, which still has to be formally adopted at European level will, inter alia, provide for the regulation of e-cigarettes.  The Tobacco Directive will: </p><p>  - set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. on nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc., for e-cigarettes,</p><p>  - make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory, </p><p>  - introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes, </p><p>  - impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.  </p><p>  As e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco the smoking of e-cigarettes is not prohibited in indoor work places under the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts 2002 to 2013.  Agencies can, however, on a voluntary basis have policies in relation to e-cigarettes if they so wish.  My Department is currently reviewing the potential harms and potential benefits of e-cigarettes before deciding the best approach to their wider regulation.</p></reply>

This total includes both new applications and renewal/review applications. In this period, there has been an overall 98.93% completion rate for the total number of applications received. Of the total number of applications processed in the period since centralisation, 95.29% of these applications have been processed within 15 working days of the application being received by the HSE.</p><p>  Applications that remain in process outside of this period of time are facilitated so that eligibility is either retained or assessment prioritised without delay to the applicant that is genuinely engaging with the process. These arrangements strive to minimise any hardship or distress on persons whose circumstances once assessed, qualify them for a medical card/GP visit card. The HSE will not cancel a person&rsquo;s medical card/GP visit card in the period before a review assessment has finalised if that person is engaging with the HSE in response to a review assessment notification and is making genuine efforts to provide all necessary information and documentation.  If a person is a new applicant presenting with an urgent medical need or an urgent medical need in respect of their dependant(s), the HSE will facilitate a prioritised assessment of eligibility once the applicant has provided all the information necessary.</p><p>  The length of time it takes for medical card appeals to be processed may vary depending on the complexity of the appeal and the number of appeals already on hand. On average, during 2013 this time frame was 4-12 weeks. The Appeals Office is currently dealing with a backlog from late 2013 which has extended this time frame to over 12 weeks. That Office is working on the back log to return to the 4-12 weeks as quickly as possible.</p><p>  It is important to note that many of these appeal cases are reviews of existing medical card holders and, in that instance, there is no immediate impact on clients as they continue to hold eligibility until the appeal decision is made.</p></reply>

While these services are in the process of being reconfigured under the HSE&rsquo;s National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years), it is important to note that all HSE areas have significant services in place for children with disabilities aged up to eighteen years.  These are provided directly by the HSE or by voluntary service providers funded by the HSE.</p><p>  The aim of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme is to achieve a national, unified approach to delivering disability health services so that there is a clear pathway to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of their disability.  An additional &euro;4m has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the Programme.  This equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.</p><p>  Almost 60 geographic-based multi-disciplinary teams have been established to date under the Programme as part of the reconfigured service model.  It is hoped that a further 30 teams will be reconfigured this year, bringing the overall total to approximately 90 teams by the end of 2014.  These figures reflect all children's disability teams that provide early intervention and school age services to children aged up to eighteen years.  The transition to this new model is taking place on a phased basis and, importantly, includes consultation and engagement with stakeholders, such as service users and their families.</p><p>  Within this context I have asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the detailed operational information requested concerning early intervention services for children with disabilities living in the Cork North Lee HSE area.</p></reply>

The increase in nursing hours available under the HRA equates to nearly 1,400 additional nurses.  Nearly 500 nurses and midwives have commenced employment in recent months on the graduate scheme, with over 200 others currently going through the recruitment process.</p><p>  It is important also to note the link between nursing qualifications and safety and to recognise that nurse education levels are also linked to patient outcomes. The recent Lancet study showed that a 10% increase in the proportion of nurses holding a nursing degree is associated with a 7% decrease in the risk of death.  Ireland has invested significantly in nurse education since the Commission on Nursing in 1998.     Approximately &euro;55 million is spent annually on nurses education and around 1,570 nurses enter the undergraduate programme each year.</p><p>  All staff working in the Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore are entitled to breaks in accordance with the provisions of the Working Time Act and the Working Time Directive.

The NAS is committed to improving the care provided to patients as well as providing faster access to care.  </p><p>  In many countries, response time indicators are used as one means to evaluate the quality of the services delivered by pre-hospital emergency care providers.  Such indicators provide a valuable source of information when used in conjunction with clinical indicators that focus on patient outcomes.  The Deputy may wish to note that while HIQA has recommended that a patient carrying vehicle should respond to critical incidents within a maximum of 18 minutes and 59 seconds, the Authority recommends that in the first instance, such incidents are responded to by a first responder, which includes advanced paramedics, paramedics, or cardiac first responders, within 7 minutes and 59 seconds or less. </p><p>  In developing response time indicators, HIQA conducted a comprehensive review of international practices in relation to pre-hospital emergency care services and associated key performance indicators.  The Authority also engaged with key stakeholders, including an expert advisory group on pre-hospital emergency care, to ensure that the initiative was informed by current work, expertise and views from both a national and international perspective.  </p><p>  However, it is important to recognise that sole reliance on response times does not provide a comprehensive picture of modern ambulance service performance.  For this reason, many jurisdictions are now moving to assess performance against clinical outcome indicators which better reflect the work of a modern ambulance service.  In that regard, the NAS is developing clinical outcome indicators, the first of which - on return of spontaneous circulation for certain types of heart attack - will be introduced in 2014. </p></reply>

This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole.</p><p>  In the main, persons in the over 70 age cohort do not have the same outlays and expenses as those under 70 years of age who are assessed on a means basis.  Under the standard  means tested medical card scheme, allowance may be made for rent/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  Generally, for those over 70, mortgages have been cleared, children have been catered for and they would not have travel-to-work related costs. </p><p>  However, persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme where they face particularly high expenses, e.g., nursing home or medication costs.  As I have outlined, this assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses and the qualifying income thresholds under this scheme are lower than over 70 gross income thresholds.  </p><p>  Furthermore, persons aged over 70 years may still be eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis where they face undue hardship in arranging medical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.</p></reply>

This is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  It is mainly aimed at those who are higher risk, such as adolescents and people who have a harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption pattern. </p><p>  Work is continuing in my Department on the development of a framework for the implementation of these measures.

In this context,additional funding of &euro;90 million, and around 1,100 new posts, has been provided over the last three Budgets.  This has been primarily directed to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams for adults and children; specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness, improving services for those with an intellectual disability and mental illness, and  enhancing Forensic Mental Health services.</p><p>  Key to developing Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), as per <i>A Vision for Change,</i> is the establishment of 99 multi-disciplinary CAMHS Teams providing acute secondary mental health care in the community, including hospital liaison and Day Hospital services.  In 2008, there were 54 CAMHS Teams.  There are now 61 Teams in place. The additional &euro;90m provided for mental health over 2012&ndash;14 is being used, in part, to  expand and enhance the skill mix of CAMHS Teams.  Around 230 new posts were allocated to CAMHS Teams over 2012-13, and recruitment of these is well advanced.  More CAMHS posts are planned for later this year.  Just over 14,000 referrals were received by the Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Mental Health Teams in 2013.  This represents nearly 1,000, or 8% more, than projected in the HSE National Service Plan 2013, while the target of 70% of referrals being seen within 3 months was maintained.</p><p><i>  A Vision for Change</i> recommends the provision of 80 Child and Adolescent psychiatric in-patient beds nationally.  In 2008, there were 16 such beds and at present there are 51 beds operational country-wide<b>, </b>with more planned.  Capacity will be enhanced also, with the completion of the CAMHS Forensic Unit as part of capital developments now underway for the National Forensic Mental Health Service, and the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  In addition, improved community based services, coupled with increasing bed capacity, are all aimed at discontinuing the practice of placing children and adolescents in adult acute in-patient units, except in exceptional circumstances.<b></b> Admissions of children to adult units have decreased by almost 60% from 2008, when there were 247 reported, to a provisional figure of 106 in 2012.</p><p>  The review of the Mental Health Act 2001, already well progressed, is a key step in providing a revised and more modern mental health legislation in this country.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to review the Act, informed by human rights standards and consultation with service users, carers and other stakeholders.</p><p>  The review has been delayed due to a number of factors, including the wishes of members of the Expert Group to first see details of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) legislation, which was published in June 2013.  Due to the high level of inter-connectivity between both sets of legislation, members of the Expert Group reviewing the Mental Health Act felt it would be necessary that the Capacity Bill should be finalised before they completed their own review.</p><p>  Work is continuing on the completion of the report of the Expert Group, and members are carefully deliberating, re-examining and refining their recommendations on key central issues such as consent to treatment, capacity, criteria for detention, and treatment of children under the Act.  It is expected that the final report will be completed in the near future, after which its recommendations will be considered at Ministerial level.</p><p>  I have noted the contents of the recent report by the Children's Rights Alliance on Mental Health services.  As I have indicated on several occasions in the past, despite the real and significant improvements that have taken place on implementing <i>A Vision for Change</i>  and modernising mental health services across the country over the last three years, historic deficiencies remain to be addressed.  The aim is to strive for equity in providing high quality services, while balancing residential and community-based provision.  This approach has already been proven in many areas at local level.  The Government will retain its commitment to mental health, and focus on up-grading all aspects of mental health care, in line with evolving service demands and resources available overall for the Health sector, for 2014 and beyond.</p></reply>

I understand that the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government is in the process of quantifying in detail the likely costs arising for repairs of local authority infrastructure from the more recent storms, in addition to the &euro;70m estimated cost from the storms up to 6 January 2014, and intends to make a full report to Government on the costs and funding in the coming weeks.   </p><p>  The remedial works for County Offaly are similar to those required throughout the country following the severe weather over the winter and are not unique to roads which overlie peat subgrades. Roads over peat have their own set of very particular problems in that they are susceptible to differential settlement and there are no easy or inexpensive ways of dealing with them. A technical guidance document entitled Guidelines on the Rehabilitation of Roads over Peat is available to local authorities to assist them in making decisions on roads with peat subgrades.</p></reply>

The National Driver Licensing Service (NDLS) is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority (RSA).   The NDLS is structured with a central unit in the RSA and three outsourced contractors.  These are: a card producer for the plastic card licence; a front office to engage with the public; and a back office to process applications.</p><p>  There were problems with the speed of processing applications in the NDLS when the system came on stream last October.  I have had regular discussions with the acting CEO of the RSA regarding the difficulties people have experienced, and how the RSA proposed to address them.  The RSA acknowledged that there were teething problems when the service opened.  Some were technical and systems issues, while others related to new staff becoming familiar with rules and processes around driving licences and permits.</p><p>  The RSA responded by increasing resources in NDLS centres experiencing delays, as well as in the licence processing centre, and providing further training to staff.  There are no major technical difficulties now affecting the service.  A booking system to allow for customers to make appointments has been operating in a Pilot Phase which was successful.  This system is now being extended on a phased basis to all NDLS offices.</p><p>  While I understand that there are still some backlogs in relation to applications, the situation has improved.   I have been informed that licence applications that are fully and correctly completed are being issued in a shorter timeframe than previously and work is continuing to achieve a ten-day turnaround currently, and a five- to eight-day turnaround by the end of March.  The RSA has assured me that the remaining backlog largely has been cleared.</p></reply>

In many cases when using the Leap card, passengers will be paying fares that are below 2011 cash fares.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the NTA's statutory responsibilities, the Government recognises the need for the CI&Eacute; companies to respond to the challenge of reduced PSO subvention funding, reduced fares income arising from reductions in passenger numbers and higher fuel costs, which are outside their control.  The board of CI&Eacute; is pursuing a range of measures to address the financial position, including payroll and other cost reductions across the three operating companies.  Improved bank facilities have been agreed, which will ensure that the company has sufficient funding into the future.</p><p>  For the three years 2011 to 2013, the total State support for Dublin Bus for PSO, capital support and support to cover the cost of free travel was &euro;335 million. A further &euro;110 million is being provided across the three headings in 2014. The Exchequer, through the NTA, has provided funding for a rolling renewal programme for the PSO bus fleet.  The 2013 allocation for this programme in Dublin Bus was &euro;28m, resulting in the purchase of 80 new buses. Further funding of &euro;20 million is being made available in 2014 for bus replacement and refurbishment. Bus is still the key public transport mode and it is important we have a reliable and efficient fleet with a reasonable average age.</p><p>  Through the NTA, my Department is funding the use of smart technology to make public transport easier to access and more reliable for the user.  Significant progress has been made with the Leap card, Real Time Passenger Information, and the National Journey Planner which maps all public transport services across the country.  The use of Wi-Fi on buses has also improved the transport experience.  The NTA will continue to progress these consumer friendly initiatives which make using public transport more attractive.  The public transport experience has improved significantly and that is where we must target our efforts in future.  I hope through avoidance of further reductions in subvention, a stabilisation of passenger numbers as the economy improves and cost-saving measures in Dublin Bus that future fare increases can be targeted at sustaining public transport that benefits commuters and our economy.</p><p>  I have set as one of my Department's priorities for 2014 to work with all transport operators, including Dublin Bus, to increase the number of people using public transport by 2% i.e. 5 million passenger journeys. Minister of State Kelly and I will be meeting regularly with senior management in all of the publicly funded transport companies and the NTA  to focus efforts to improve patronage on our buses, trams and trains.</p></reply>

Negotiations have been under way for some time with the authorities in Canada.  As driver licensing in Canada operates at provincial rather than national level, this process involves comparison of multiple licensing regimes with the Irish driver licensing regime, in order to ensure compatibility.  It will mean reaching separate agreements with individual provinces, rather than a single bilateral agreement with Canada.  Inevitably, this is a longer process than a simple bilateral agreement.</p><p>  I understand from the RSA that substantial progress has been made with the provinces of Ontario, Manitoba, and Newfoundland &amp;amp; Labrador and I expect to see the first agreement signed within the next few weeks.   I will give legal effect to the agreements soon after they are signed through Statutory Instruments.</p></reply>

The appropriate date, therefore, is 31 December 2015. Under these aforementioned agreements it is my understanding that Dublin Port Company received &euro;1.1million for each of the years 2012 and 2011 for example. The figures are disclosed in the Company&rsquo;s publically available annual accounts.</p><p>  The monies received by Dublin Port Company in respect of agreements relating to the East-Link bridge are an operational matter for the port company itself and not one in which I have any function. However, as I previously informed the Deputy, the Company itself discloses this information in its publically available annual accounts.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p><p>  On 23 January this year, I announced the &euro;331.9m investment programme in 2014 for regional and local roads.  The economic reality of recent years has meant significant reductions in roads budgets across the board and the 2014 allocation represents a cut of 17% on the 2013 budget. This year, I have however been able to protect funding for road maintenance and repair by curtailing some grant programmes, including the Specific Grant Programme.  Our priority is to maintain the existing road network, and unfortunately this means that there is little scope for carrying out new road improvement projects. Applications were sought for minor bridge repair works (which is a subset of the current Specific Grant Programme) for 2014.  This is in line with focusing monies on road and bridge maintenance and rehabilitation.</p><p>  Allocations have been made this year for improvement projects where commitments are in place i.e. 30 projects under the Specific Improvement Projects scheme and 13 existing Strategic schemes. In addition allocations have been made for 245 low-cost safety projects and 162 bridge rehabilitation projects.</p><p>  It is also important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils' own resources spending in this area.  It is also open to Councils to fund projects from their own resources, these include commercial rates and the local government fund which is in turn made up receipts from Motor Tax and the Local Property Tax.</p></reply>
