    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-18a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018091800053#WRA00800"><p>The 2017 report of Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) "Energy in Ireland" indicates that Solar Photovoltaic (Solar PV) generation accounted for 0.01% of energy contribution to gross electricity consumption in Ireland at the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  I welcome and have noted reports of the falling costs of certain renewable technologies, including Solar PV and Offshore Wind, over the past number of years, not only compared with other renewables but also with conventional forms of generation. Furthermore, analysis by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA 2017) forecasts that Solar PV costs will continue to fall a further 50% globally out to 2020.</p>  <p>  Increasing renewable technology diversity is one of several policy objectives of my Department. In July, Government approved the high level design of the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and this Scheme will now proceed through the EU State Aid approval process. It is expected that the first renewable electricity auction will take place under RESS in 2019.   </p>  <p>  The RESS has been designed to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards an EU-wide renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030, within a competitive auction-based, cost effective framework. The Scheme will provide for a renewable electricity (RES-E) ambition of up to a maximum of 55% by 2030 subject to determining the cost effective level, which will be set out in the draft National Energy and Climate Plan to be submitted to the EU Commission in December. The RESS will deliver a broad range of policy objectives including the provision of pathways and supports for communities to participate in renewable energy projects, broadening the renewable electricity technology mix and increasing energy security, energy sustainability and ensuring the cost effectiveness of energy policy.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises the important role that Solar PV can play as part of a mix of renewable generation and the RESS will offer a potential pathway for Solar PV projects at scale, within a cost competitive framework.  My Department already supports Solar PV through the SEAI-led Better Energy Communities and pilot Deep Retrofit schemes, and in July I launched a pilot micro generation scheme to support Solar PV targeting domestic users and self-consumption.</p>  <p>  In addition to these opportunities, Solar PV is supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, under the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme (PPIS) as part of  the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS). Complimentary programmes like these delivered across a number of Government Departments are crucial in delivering our climate and energy ambitions as laid out in the National Development Plan and Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

Those premises that will not be served commercially will be connected as part of the National Broadband Plan State led intervention, the procurement process for which is now in its final stages.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce, and the Broadband Officers who operate in every County are pursuing initiatives to improve connectivity for citizens.</p>  <p>  Public WiFi is available in Cavan Town, and libraries around the County also offer this service. There are also 2 digital hubs in Cavan. Multiple SMART initiatives are also being pursued, including free computer classes and digital skills training, social media classes and classes that will allow local businesses to operate online more effectively.</p>  <p>  Today in Monaghan five of the main towns have free public WiFi available, with 40,000 uses recorded in the last 12 months. Free WiFi is also available in libraries throughout the county, while SMART initiatives such as increased presence of security cameras in Monaghan&rsquo;s towns and the development of online resources for heritage sites and literary trails are being pursued.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives, and more, show the positive effect the National Broadband Plan has already brought to Counties Cavan and Monaghan and they serve only as a forerunner to the high speed broadband service to be delivered to every household, school and business both in Cavan and Monaghan and throughout Ireland under the National Broadband Plan State led intervention.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-18a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018091800053#WRA01400"><p>The Government, or I as Minister, have no statutory function in the monitoring or setting of electricity prices.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for the regulation of the gas or electricity markets is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). It is an independent statutory body, and solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. Under the current Oireachtas Committee formations, the CRU is responsible to the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment where these matters are discussed as the Committee sees fit.</p>  <p>  Consistent with European energy policy, the electricity and gas markets in Ireland are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. The position of successive Governments has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses, in terms of suppliers, products and prices. Competition exerts downward pressure on suppliers&rsquo; prices.</p>  <p>  One of Commission&rsquo;s statutory functions is to carry out market monitoring to ensure that competition continues to develop and that customers benefit from competition. As part of its market monitoring work, CRU last year concluded that Irish energy markets are competitive. </p>  <p>  Recent announcements regarding electricity price increases reflect that since the final quarter of 2016, average international natural gas prices have increased sharply. They have, more or less, continued to rise through 2017 and the first half of 2018, with day ahead prices in June being 56% higher than 12 months earlier. Consistent with the upward international gas price trend, average wholesale electricity prices have increased in like manner. After an initial delay, the effect of this protracted rise in the wholesale electricity price since end 2016 has been observed in the retail market, with all significant Irish electricity suppliers announcing household customer price increases.</p>  <p>  Section 10A of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended, sets out the procedure under which the Minister may give &ldquo;general policy directions&rdquo;. The legislation sets out details on the tasks and inter-alia restrictions, timelines and consultation requirements with the independent regulator and Oireachtas.  Energy markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime in which Member States must guarantee the independence of National Regulatory Authorities, which are expressively forbidden from taking direct instructions from government, or any public body. The regime also restricts policy directions in the form of general policy guidelines in certain areas that are prescribed regulatory duties and powers in the EU Third Energy Package.  A policy direction in this matter is therefore not being considered.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-18a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018091800054#WRB00400"><p>I understand that the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 is subject to legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment. Hearings took place in July and I understand that the Joint Committee also received a presentation from the International Energy Agency on the related topic of energy security. I look forward to seeing the output of the Joint Committee's deliberations on the scrutiny of the Bill.</p>  <p>  The Bill itself is a legislative proposal at this point in time, and one which the Government does not support. There has been no change in the statutory position regarding oil and gas exploration. Similarly, there has been no change in Government policy on energy exploration, energy security, and the energy transition. Therefore, the existing legal and policy framework for exploration will continue to be implemented. </p>  <p>  It is accepted that Ireland will continue to need oil and particularly gas for quite some time. The Bill itself will have no impact on the amount of emissions Ireland creates by burning fossil fuels; rather it will commit the country to source all of its oil and gas from abroad. It does not make sense to ban exploration for Ireland's resources and make Ireland 100% dependent on imports for our fossil fuel needs in the future, when we know that Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous production at Corrib will decline and Kinsale is approaching its end of life.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the Government's approach to tackle emissions from fossil fuels is to focus efforts on energy efficiency and renewable energy which make essential contributions to all of the major objectives of climate and energy policies, including improved competitiveness, security of supply, sustainability, and the transition to a low carbon economy.</p></reply>

In accordance with this commitment, my Department developed an Anti-Dumping Initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations. Since its introduction, I have allocated &euro;3.3 million to this initiative which has supported over 400 clean-up and restorative projects while also equipping local authorities with the latest technologies to catch those responsible.</p>  <p>  I am also providing funding for the clean up of farm tyre waste and one of the collections will be taking place in Cootehill Mart, Co. Cavan on the 29th of September.</p>  <p>  Since coming into office, illegal dumping is an issue that I have actively dealt with through significant funding increases and supports for local authorities. My Department works to support and assist local authorities in tackling difficult enforcement challenges, alleviating environmental risk and prosecuting cases in the appropriate courts.  </p>  <p>  My commitment to supporting waste enforcement activities on the ground is demonstrated through the continued annual investment of &euro;7.4 million in the network of 150 local authority waste enforcement officers, increased resources for the Environmental Protection Agency with an allocation of &euro;34.8 million this year and the further development of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authority (WERLA) Offices with an annual budget in excess of &euro;1 million. I support a cross county approach to waste enforcement through the Regional WERLA enforcement structure.  My Department also supports a multi-agency approach to waste enforcement through the National Waste Enforcement Steering Committee which is chaired by my Department but has members including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the EPA, the WERLA's, the National Trans-frontier Shipment Office, the National Waste Collection Permit Office, the CCMA, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;70,000 is also being provided to support a pilot project undertaken by Sligo County Council aimed at tackling and addressing the source of illegal dumping. </p>  <p>  In addition and in recognition of the particular difficulties border counties have experienced in dealing with diesel laundering waste dumping, my Department continues to fully reimburse the clean-up costs associated with this nefarious practice.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-18a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018091800054#WRB01000"><p>As Minister, I am responsible for the postal sector including the governance of An Post which is a commercial State body with a mandate to deliver a postal delivery service and a viable post office network. I am acutely conscious of the value placed by communities in both rural and urban areas on services provided by post offices and I am fully committed to ensuring that a sustainable post office network is available to all our citizens for the medium and for the long term.</p>  <p>  It is widely accepted that the post office network has been facing many challenges for some years now with a continuing decline in transaction numbers primarily driven by the move to online payments and online banking, as well as eSubstitution. Standing still is not an option for the network.</p>  <p>  In April this year An Post announced a renewed vision for the post office network which centres on the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network. The announcement was supported by an agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) executive following months of intensive negotiations, and was subsequently endorsed by 80% of IPU members. In its negotiations with An Post, Postmasters sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business. An Post advises that where a post office closes, 70% of the business transfers to a neighbouring office. The reality is that by facilitating those who wish to exit the business, neighbouring offices are further supported thereby ensuring a more sustainable network for the future.</p>  <p>  The agreement represents a necessary first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates by providing a service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas.</p>  <p>  As part of its strategy for modernising the post office network, An Post has established a dedicated business unit within An Post, An Post Retail.  Additional services that An Post propose to introduce through the network include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses. There is already a rapid expansion of banking services happening with the Smart Current Account and enhanced foreign exchange facilities. Post offices will have credit card services and will be able to provide loans to small business and personal loans. An Post is committed to ensuring that our post offices will be equipped with the range of services that will attract and retain footfall but these measures are meaningless unless the public use the services provided. Key to the survival of this renewed network is the willingness of all citizens to use it.</p>  <p>  Government business is the backbone of the network. In April this year the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department&rsquo;s contract with An Post to provide pensions, child benefit and other social welfare payments at post offices.</p>  <p>  While Government policy is to offer Government services online, there will always be a segment of the population that is not comfortable or proficient accessing online tools or services. The post office network is the obvious choice as the &ldquo;offline gateway&rdquo; for citizens with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens. Government funding of &euro;80,000 has been allocated to roll out a pilot scheme for Digital Assist which will see 10 post offices equipped to help citizens with online Government interactions. The pilot schemes are being currently rolled out in rural post offices.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have secured Government approval to explore how further services might be made available to our &ldquo;offline citizens&rdquo;. This would be delivered via a centralised procurement framework. A Working Group comprising representatives across Government Departments will be established to consider this issue and will report back to Government by the end of year.</p></reply>

It encourages involvement of local communities in local action and decision-making, and assists them in working towards the goal of sustainable development.</p>  <p>  In 2017, I increased funding for the LA21 Environmental Partnership Fund to &euro;460,000 and I maintained this increased level of funding for this year's scheme. Funding provided by my Department is matched by local authorities, and projects may also attract funding from other sources, such as private sector funding, in order to maximise the potential of the partnership arrangements.</p>  <p>  A list of the 880 successful funding applications for 2018 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  The LA21 Environmental Partnership Fund is only one of a range of initiatives supported by Government, at both national and regional/local level, to help Ireland achieve the17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, which includes Goal 13 on Climate Action. Ireland&rsquo;s National Implementation Plan 2018-2020 is our direct response to the 2030 Agenda and provides a whole-of-government approach to implementing the Agenda, including by identifying strategic priorities to guide implementation including awareness, participation and support.</p>  <p>  For example, as part of the National Dialogue on Climate Action (NDCA), my Department is supporting An Taisce&rsquo;s Green Schools Programme to implement a National Climate Change Action and Awareness Programme in schools across the country. This includes a climate ambassador programme, an annual Climate Action Week in October, and a Green Schools Expo. This Dialogue also incorporates a programme of regional and local events. Other initiatives supported by the NDCA include the EPA&rsquo;s series of professionally moderated and accessible expert lectures/debates on key policy issues, and my Department also sponsors the annual Tidy Towns Climate Action special award.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in January 2018 I announced an allocation of &euro;10 million over five years for the establishment and development of four Local Authority Climate Action Regional Offices. This commitment recognises the significant obligation which has been placed on local government to develop and implement its own climate action measures and to build capacity within the sector in terms of both mitigation and adaptation. Service level agreements have been put in place between my Department and each lead authority. These offices will provide expertise and capacity at local and regional level to contribute effectively to the national transition to a low carbon and climate resilient economy.</p>  <p>  In addition the publication in February 2018 of the National Development Plan, reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. It will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. This funding commitment provides a clear opportunity for significant up-scaling in our investments to deliver deep emissions reductions in the coming decade and to further develop and implement the National Mitigation Plan and National Adaptation Framework.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the National Development Plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility. This means that well over &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on climate mitigation, and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.</p></reply>

The annual report is available on the website of the Department of the Taoiseach. In relation to the Programme's commitments on climate change, the annual report records the publication of Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan in July 2017, and first statutory National Adaptation Framework in January 2018. </p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low carbon economy by 2050.  </p>  <p>  In relation to our EU obligations, the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) 406/2009/EC established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in May 2018, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.</p>  <p>  While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, with increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.</p>  <p>  The ESD includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets. Using banked emissions allocations from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2017. However, cumulative emissions are projected to exceed annual targets for 2018, 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis is ongoing to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required. </p>  <p>  For 2030, the recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. This is where we must now focus our efforts to ensure that  at the absolute very least we meet our 2030 target. </p>  <p>  To meet these targets, Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July last year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of the Plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. </p>  <p>  Building on these strategies, the publication in February of the National Development Plan, reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. It will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. This funding commitment provides a clear opportunity for significant up-scaling in our investments to deliver deep emissions reductions in the coming decade and to further develop and implement the National Mitigation Plan and National Adaptation Framework. Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the National Development Plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility. This means that well over &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on climate mitigation, and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.</p></reply>

While the rate has fallen from 15.3% at the end of 2013, it is still very high and equates to a loss of &euro;40m per annum to public service broadcasting. </p>  <p>  To address this issue, my Department has been working with An Post and RT&Eacute; on an on-going basis to ensure that the TV licence collection system is working as effectively as possible. Measures such as marketing campaigns, more evening and weekend inspection and appointment of additional temporary inspectors are just some of the initiatives that have been utilised to enhance sales and improve compliance rates. </p>  <p>  While these measures are important steps, I believe that the current system needs to be reformed. As the Deputy will be aware, I obtained Government approval last year to draft a number of legislative amendments to the Broadcasting Act 2009, including amendments for the tendering of TV Licence fee collection. The proposed amendments were considered under Pre-Legislative Scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment and their report was published on March 8. The Bill is currently being drafted by Parliamentary Counsel and is included as a priority on the Government's Legislative Programme.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is also aware, I requested the Committee to examine the longer term issue of the future funding of public service media and the Committee published their report at the end of November 2017.</p>  <p>  Following consideration of the recommendations made in that report, Government approval was received in July 2018 to establish a Working Group on the Future Funding of Public Service Broadcasting.  The Working Group will examine a number of options to support future funding and the reform of television licence collection and it is intended that it will report to me in Quarter 1 2019.  </p>  <p>  The option of registering for a television licence at the point of purchase is not, however, under consideration. This practice was in place previously but was repealed in the Broadcasting Act 2009 due to the burden it placed on traders and the poor level of information recorded. I have no plans to re-introduce this method of recording data. </p></reply>

Standing still is not an option for the network.</p>  <p>  In April this year An Post announced a renewed vision for the post office network which centres on the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network. The announcement was supported by an agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) executive following months of intensive negotiations, and was subsequently endorsed by 80% of IPU members. In its negotiations with An Post, Postmasters sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business.</p>  <p>  It is important that the decision of those who wish to leave the business is respected. These are not decisions that have been taken lightly or without good reason.

Fishing for eel was by way of public licence and therefore the issue of compensation does not arise. However, both Minister Naughten and I have secured Exchequer funding for a support measure.</p>  <p>  Officials have engaged with the European Commission in relation to Ireland's proposals to fund a support scheme for former eel fishermen and the Department has received written advice from the Revenue Commissioners as regards the tax treatment of any payments under such a scheme.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the scheme will be open to former fishermen who held an Inland Fisheries Ireland eel fishing licence or an equivalent permit from ESB prior to the closure.

The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to tackling climate change as a critical issue. The National Development Plan (NDP) commits almost &euro;22 billion to address the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the NDP allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility. This capital investment will enable Ireland to deliver a significant reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.</p>  <p>  The Effort Sharing Directive (ESD) established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020. Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. The Directive includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets. Using banked emissions allocations from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2017. However, cumulative emissions are projected to exceed annual targets for 2018, 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.  While this purchasing requirement is not expected to be significant, further analysis is ongoing to quantify the likely costs involved.</p>  <p>  In terms of renewable energy, the EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. This represented a 12.9 percentage point increase on Ireland's reference starting point of 3.1% in 2005, and was the third highest increase for any of the 28 Member States of the European Union. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.</p>  <p>  Good progress has been made to date, with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) advising that 10.8% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources; with a projected 2020 outcome range of 12.8% to 14% - that is, Ireland is expected to reach between 80-90+% of its 2020 target. The policy focus is on the implementation of new renewable energy measures, such as the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) to assist our efforts to accelerate the low carbon energy transition.</p>  <p>  Contingency planning has also commenced to explore the potential mechanisms and cost of addressing our renewable energy targets within the framework of the Directive. The Renewable Energy Directive makes explicit provision for  countries to work together  to enable targets to be met and one mechanism involving statistical transfers allows Member States to reach their target by purchasing credits from Member States that overachieve on their renewable targets to make up any shortfall. Any purchases arising would be made over a number of years and the cumulative costs would not be known until 2021. The Department is considering various Member States who may be in surplus and informal discussions have taken place with a number of them. </p>  <p>  The 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) sets out the Government&rsquo;s policy for the sustainable development of our abundant offshore renewable energy resources. Offshore renewable energy covers a number of technology types and includes wind (fixed and floating), wave and tidal, all of which rely on harnessing the motion of wind or water to generate energy.  Of these technology types fixed offshore wind has reached the commercial stage, while floating wind, wave and tidal technology are still at the experimental stage globally. Floating wind has the potential to be deployed in deeper waters and as such could have potential for development off the south and west coasts of Ireland. Bottom fixed wind turbines are limited to relatively shallow waters. To date, Ireland has only one offshore fixed wind farm generating electricity in Irish waters. </p>  <p>  Between 2014 and 2017 capital funding of &euro;17.7 million was allocated by my Department under the OREDP for research and development of offshore renewable energy technology, with a further &euro;4.5 million allocated in 2018. Government funding supports Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to world class test facilities and infrastructure including the full-scale Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS), off the coast of Mayo.  </p>  <p>  In addition to Exchequer funding, the provision of a robust consenting regime, support scheme and development of an offshore grid policy are particularly pertinent in supporting our ambition for offshore renewable energy activities. </p>  <p>  The RESS was approved by Government in July and will now be subject to the EU state aid approval process. The first RESS auction will be held in 2019. The new Scheme has been designed to incentivise sufficient new renewable electricity generation to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU wide renewable energy target of 32% for 2030. Technology diversity, including solar PV and offshore wind, will occur naturally as the scheme matures and certain intervention levers may be used within each auction round to promote certain policy objectives such as community participation, community ownership and diversifying the renewable energy mix.</p>  <p>  Legislative proposals have been led by the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government to draft the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill, including provisions to address the absence of a regulatory framework to regulate offshore renewable energy developments beyond the limits of the foreshore (12 nautical miles). If we are to attract investment in the offshore renewable energy sector, it is critical that a robust, streamlined consenting regime is provided to regulate activities in the maritime area. </p>  <p>  My Department will also commence discussions later in the year to develop offshore grid connection policy in conjunction with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) and Eirgrid. The CRU have already published their Enduring Connection Policy (ECP) Phase I which takes into account shovel ready onshore projects. Phase II of the ECP is expected to include offshore applications for grid connections. Ireland is also a member of the North Seas Energy Cooperation Initiative at EU level. The key objective of this project is to enhance coordination and integration of national efforts of renewable deployment in addition to offshore grid planning. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s detailed policy measures and 2030 commitments on emissions reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency will be set out in the upcoming first National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), a draft of which is due in December 2018.</p></reply>

The announcement was supported by an agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) executive following months of intensive negotiations, and was subsequently endorsed by 80% of IPU members. In its negotiations with An Post, Postmasters sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business. An Post advises that where a post office closes, 70% of the business transfers to a neighbouring office.

The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator.</p>  <p>  Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce. Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, that will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland. </p>  <p>  In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various initiatives are under way:</p>  <p>  - My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage. </p>  <p>  - Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis. This exercise is ongoing, and has been included in the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme.</p>  <p>  - A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots. It will also inform future policy in my Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.</p>  <p>  - A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure. </p>  <p>  - ComReg is delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p>  <p>  - Following a consultation process ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p></reply>

The key legislation in this regard is the Litter Pollution Act 1997 to 2009. Under the Act, the primary management and enforcement responsibility rests with the Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I recognise the challenges presented by littering and I believe that a multi-facetted approach is required, incorporating effective enforcement, public awareness and education. Raising awareness of the litter problem and educating the young people of this country is key to affecting a long term change in society&rsquo;s attitudes towards litter disposal. In this context, my Department supports a number of national anti-litter initiatives including the Local Authority Anti-Litter Awareness Grants, the National Spring Clean Campaign, the Green Schools Programme, the Protecting Uplands and Rural Environments (PURE) Project, the Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) &ndash; Litter League, and negotiated agreements with the banking and chewing gum industries.</p>  <p>  Although I am pleased that consecutive annual National Litter Pollution Monitoring System Reports have shown that the litter situation is generally improving across the country in recent years, I am concerned that the fines for offences currently in place under the Litter Pollution Acts, particularly for "on-the-spot" fines, do not serve as a sufficient deterrent. That is why I propose to increase substantially the penalty for on-the-spot offences bringing the current fine of &euro;150 to &euro;250. I am also supporting the overall intent of the private members Litter Pollution (Amendment) Bill 2017, while recognising that some amendments will be required. </p>  <p>  I was of course concerned at the findings of the inaugural IBAL/An Taisce survey of coastlines and waterways. The issue of marine pollution, particularly in relation to plastics, is an increasing priority for me and the EU.  I have welcomed the recently published EU proposal on single use plastic products found on Europe&rsquo;s beaches and seas, as well as lost and abandoned fishing gear, which together account for 70% of all marine litter. </p></reply>

The latest projections from the EPA (published in May 2018) provide an updated assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s total projected greenhouse gas emissions out to 2030.    </p>  <p>  The EPA produced two scenarios when preparing the greenhouse gas emission projections, a With Existing Measures (WEM) scenario and a With Additional Measures (WAM) scenario. The WEM scenario assumes that no additional policies and measures, beyond those already in place by the end of 2016 (the year of the latest national greenhouse gas emission inventory), are implemented. The WAM scenario assumes implementation of the WEM scenario as well as further implementation of Government renewable and energy efficiency policies and measures, including those set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP).</p>  <p>  As per the latest EPA projections for the energy industries sector, projected emissions in the WAM scenario show an increase over the WEM scenario from 2020 to 2025. The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy that supports peat being used for power generation ceases in December 2019 under the WEM scenario, and consequently peat used for power generation significantly reduces. Thereafter, the fuel type used for electricity generation is influenced by fuel price and in this case gas largely replaces peat in the power generation fuel mix leading to lower emissions. Emissions are higher in the WAM scenario based on the assumption that Ireland&rsquo;s peat power plants continue to operate with support for biomass provided for under the REFIT 3 scheme. This scheme includes the co-firing of peat and biomass for power generation which means more peat is used after 2019 to co-fire with biomass. The assumption of biomass co-firing with peat post 2020 is not included in the WEM scenario as the REFIT 3 decision for co-firing at the relevant peat power plants was made in April 2017 (after the 31 December 2016 cut-off point for policies and measures to be included in the WEM scenario).</p>  <p>  The use of peat for power generation will be progressively eliminated by 2030 by converting peat power stations to more sustainable low-carbon technologies. The Lough Ree and West Offaly plants will no longer receive support for their peat production under the PSO from the end of 2019. Both plants have been approved under the REFIT 3 scheme for PSO support for co-firing 30% of total capacity out to 2030, and it is expected that these plants will begin co firing on biomass in 2019. These two plants require the relevant planning permission to operate beyond 2019. The Edenderry plant has been approved for 30% co-firing support out to 2030, subject to renewal of planning permission.  Further increases in the percentage of biomass in the fuel mix of the peat stations is a commercial matter for Bord na Mona or ESB.</p>  <p>  The emissions from the three peat fired power plants are accounted for under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). It is a matter for the companies involved to manage their emissions and ensure that they are in compliance with the ETS.</p></reply>

Standing still is not an option for the network.</p>  <p>  In April this year An Post announced a renewed vision for the post office network which centres on the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network. A central tenet of this strategy was the agreement of a new contract for Postmasters as well as investment in the network. An extended range of services, opening hours and service options are also being rolled out. The announcement was supported by an agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) executive following months of intensive negotiations, and was subsequently endorsed by 80% of IPU members. In its negotiations with An Post, Postmasters sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business. An Post advises that where a post office closes, 70% of the business transfers to a neighbouring office. The reality is that by facilitating those that wish to exit the business, neighbouring offices are further supported thereby ensuring a more sustainable network for the future. </p>  <p>  The agreement represents a necessary first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates by providing a service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas. </p>  <p>  As part of its strategy for modernising the post office network, An Post has established a dedicated business unit within An Post, An Post Retail.  Additional services that An Post proposes to introduce through the network include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses. There is already a rapid expansion of banking services happening with the Smart Current Account and enhanced foreign exchange facilities. Post offices will have credit card services and will be able to provide loans to small business and personal loans. An Post is committed to ensuring that our post offices will be equipped with the range of services that will attract and retain footfall but these measures are meaningless unless the public use the services provided. Key to the survival of this renewed network is the willingness of all citizens to use it. </p>  <p>  Government business is the backbone of the network. In April this year the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department&rsquo;s contract with An Post to provide pensions, child benefit and other social welfare payments at post offices. </p>  <p>  While Government policy is to offer Government services online, there will always be a segment of the population that is not comfortable or proficient accessing online tools or services. The post office network is the obvious choice as the &ldquo;offline gateway&rdquo; for citizens with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens. Government funding of &euro;80,000 has been allocated to roll out a pilot scheme for Digital Assist which will see 10 post offices equipped to help citizens with online Government interactions.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have secured Government approval to explore how further services might be made available to our &ldquo;offline citizens&rdquo;. This would be delivered via a centralised procurement framework. A Working Group comprising representatives across Government Departments will be established to consider this issue and will report back to Government by the end of year.</p></reply>

While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, with increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.</p>  <p>  For 2030, the recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. This is where we must now focus our efforts to ensure that, at the absolute very least, we meet our 2030 target. </p>  <p>  To meet these targets, Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July last year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of the Plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p>  <p>  This Plan very explicitly defined the scale of the challenge Ireland faces in decarbonising its economy and acknowledged that it was a first step and not a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050. Rather it began the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. The Plan is a &lsquo;living document&rsquo; which is being implemented and updated on an on-going basis. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I am required, under the 2015 Act, to bring forward a new National Mitigation Plan at least once every five years. The latest date by which this must happen is, therefore, July 2022.  I propose to initiate shortly the process of updating the current Plan in order to facilitate the detailed policy design required to realise the high-level of ambition articulated in the National Development Plan as well as to develop further cost-effective policy options to address Ireland's targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation. This process will also be informed by Ireland&rsquo;s National Energy and Climate Plan, and by a new long-term low emissions strategy, both of which Ireland must prepare and finalise by the end of 2019 under the EU Clean Energy Package. I intend that the long-term strategy will further elaborate sectoral pathways for Ireland to meet its long-term decarbonisation objectives to 2050, as set out in the National Policy Position.</p></reply>

This is in line with Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Paris Agreement and the National Policy Position which sets out a long-term vision of an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that my Department supports the progressive conversion of peat power stations to more sustainable low-carbon technologies such as biomass by 2030. The REFIT 3 scheme provides support for co-firing of biomass up to 30% of the capacity of each of the three peat power stations. The Scheme provides a transitional period to allow Bord na Mona to manage the phased move away from peat harvesting for electricity production and has the potential to stimulate the growth of a domestic biomass supply chain in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Since 2016, Bord na Mona's Edenderry plant has used the REFIT 3 support to co-fire biomass along with peat and the company's recent annual report notes that  80% of the biomass used in the Edenderry power station in the year to end March 2018 came from domestic sources. The two ESB peat power stations are expected to begin co-firing using the REFIT 3 support for biomass scheme from the end of 2019, subject to planning permission and other consents. </p>  <p>  Use of appropriate sustainability criteria will help to ensure that use of biomass does not have a detrimental effect on the world&rsquo;s forests. EU-wide sustainability criteria are being introduced in the revised Renewable Energy Directive, which is expected to introduce provisions to ensure that energy biomass will be required to emit significantly less carbon than the fossil fuel equivalent. This Directive will exclude certain types of biomass from contributing to a member state&rsquo;s renewable energy performance such as biomass from areas of high biodiversity, areas designated for nature protection purposes and areas designated for protection of rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems or species.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Bord na Mona&rsquo;s BioEnergy division sources sustainable biomass that is used at the Edenderry power station, based on a set of sustainability principles, aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This will help to ensure that biomass used in electricity generation in Ireland is from sustainable sources.</p></reply>

Under Section 53 of the Act, the Compliance Committee of the BAI has the power to decide to conduct an investigation into an apparent breach by a broadcaster of a requirement of the Act or of broadcasting codes and rules. I note that the BAI Authority and Compliance Committee considered a number of complaints in respect of related matters in 2012.</p>  <p>  Given the independent role of the regulator and its powers under the Broadcasting Act, it is the appropriate body to consider this matter, and I have informed the member accordingly.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have asked my officials to bring this matter to the attention of the BAI which I can confirm they have done so.   </p></reply>

In relation to recycling plastic packaging, Ireland is well ahead of its target set in European legislation, as reported in the EPA Progress Report Towards EU Targets 2017, as a result of programmes and initiatives taken to date.</p><p>On 28 May 2018, the EU Commission published a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment. This draft legislation proposes new EU-wide rules to target the 10 most prevalent single-use plastic (SUP) products found on Europe's beaches and seas, as well as lost and abandoned fishing gear, which together account for 70% of all marine litter.</p><p>The full text of the legislative proposal which sets out all the measures contained therein is available at the following link &ndash; .</p><p>As I indicated to the Deputy in my response to question 36530/10 on 7 September 2018, the Commission has indicated that this proposal should be treated as a priority by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in order to deliver tangible results within a short timeframe. Nationally, I am engaging in a range of initiatives, including commissioning a study to explore how we can achieve the 90% target for plastic bottles sought by the Commission in the proposed SUP Directive. I am cognisant, however, that the Commission has warned of the risk of market fragmentation when Member States take measures in an uncoordinated manner, which differ in scope, focus and ambition level. Therefore, my immediate focus is to work closely with the Commission and my EU counterparts to ensure this proposed Directive is progressed as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Prior to this, the power of appointment of State Solicitors had been vested in the Attorney General by Section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  State Solicitors are appointed by the Director of Public Prosecutions under contracts for service and report to the Director and her senior staff. </p>  <p>  There are 32 State Solicitors areas.  Generally one State Solicitor is appointed to every county outside of Dublin.  Exceptions to this rule apply in Counties Cork, Galway, Kildare, Limerick and Tipperary.  In County Cork four State Solicitors have been appointed; one each for Cork City, Cork North East, Cork South East and Cork West.  In County Limerick two State Solicitors have been appointed; one for Limerick City and one for Limerick County.  Counties Galway, Kildare and Tipperary have all been divided into two State Solicitor areas.</p>  <p>  In Dublin the Solicitors Division of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, headed by the Chief Prosecution Solicitor, provides a solicitor service to the Director.  The Division is staffed by solicitors directly employed by the Office and is responsible for the preparation and presentation of cases in the Dublin District and Circuit Courts, the Central Criminal Court and Special Criminal Court, the Court of Appeal and the High and Supreme Courts.  Outside the Dublin area the 32 local state solicitors provide a solicitor service in the Circuit Court and in some District Court matters in their respective local areas.</p>  <p>  When vacancies arise for State Solicitor positions they are advertised and following an open competition a contract is awarded for typically a 10 year period.  The contract awarded is a contract for service.  No oath is sworn on appointment; rather the obligations and duties of the State Solicitor are set out in their contract.  As the contract is not a contract of service (employment contract) the issue of full time or part time does not arise.  The contract places an obligation on the State Solicitor to discharge all of the criminal prosecution work in their area.  In larger areas such as Cork City and Limerick City because of the volume of work the State Solicitor will engage additional solicitor support to assist them in the discharge of their contractual obligations.  The contract allows the State Solicitor to engage in private practice subject to a range of restrictions.  </p>  <p>  There is no specific contractual prohibition on a State Solicitor acting as a contractor or subcontractor for a foreign State provided that the terms of any such contract or subcontract would not conflict with the terms of their contract as State Solicitor.</p></reply>

There is significant work underway across each of these areas.</p>  <p>  Cabinet Committee D also provides a forum for strategic oversight of the implementation of Project Ireland 2040, the Government&rsquo;s overarching policy initiative to achieve balanced development, and meet the infrastructure needs of our growing population. </p>  <p>  Under the two pillars of Project Ireland 2040 - the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan &ndash; Four Funds, totaling &euro;4 billion in investment, have been launched in the areas of both Rural and Urban Regeneration and Development, Climate Action, and Disruptive Technologies. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Land Development Agency, another cornerstone initiative of Project Ireland 2040 was recently launched.  It will work to ensure the optimal use and management of State land through strategic development and regeneration, with an immediate focus on delivering homes, including social and affordable homes.</p>  <p>  Housing remains a central priority for the Government. While the indicators show that the numbers of new houses being built is up by more than a third compared to this time last year and is increasing month on month, we recognise that we are still facing a huge challenge in meeting demand.  We will continue to focus on increasing housing supply, tackling homelessness and increasing the availability of affordable and social housing through the delivery of Rebuilding Ireland and the additional policy measures announced by Minister Murphy to tackle these issues.</p>  <p>  Climate action objectives are also at the heart of Project Ireland 2040 and building on the National Mitigation Plan an investment of &euro;22 billion in Exchequer and non-Exchequer funding will be made to ensure a step change in climate action policy.</p></reply>

This was a special acknowledgement from the Government to the members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who served during the centenary year.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware from my replies to previous Parliamentary Questions, and as I have indicated in response to representations on this issue, many thousands of personnel have served in the Defence Forces since the foundation of the State.  To put in place a mechanism to establish the identity of each, contact those who are still alive, decide on eligibility and, in the case of infirm or deceased former members, resolve who should get the medal on their behalf, would place an inordinate and disproportionate administrative burden on my Department.  This, in turn, would divert important resources to the detriment of other more pressing and relevant requirements of my Department and the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the contribution of veterans to the centenary commemorative events in 2016 it was agreed to present a framed medal to each of the Veterans Associations along with a plaque for each of ONE&rsquo;s 41 Posts and each of IUNVA&rsquo;s 21 Branches.  It is not proposed to revisit this arrangement. </p></reply>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  On foot of a request for ATCP assistance from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Defence Forces personnel were tasked with a number of activities during the Papal visit.  </p>  <p>  The activities completed by Defence Forces personnel ranged from conventional military tasks such as armed security cordons with surveillance equipment and engineer specialist search teams to assisting with the movement of patrons during events. </p>  <p>  Unlike other areas of the Public Service and due to the nature of the duties performed, overtime is not available to members of the Defence Forces.  In its place a Military Service Allowance (MSA) is paid to all ranks up to the level of Colonel.  Military Service Allowance is designed to compensate for the special conditions associated with military life.  These include unsocial hours of duty, exposure to danger, and the restrictions inherent in military discipline. For Privates, Corporals and Sergeants with more 3 years in service, MSA is worth &euro;115.43 per week, per person. For Senior NCOs the rate is &euro;122.87 per week. </p>  <p>  In line with any other occasion when the Defence Forces are requested to operate in an Aid to the Civil Power, Defence Force members on duty in support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during the Papal visit will receive Security Duty Allowance (SDA).  The current rates of SDA is &euro;23.81 for each day on duty for less than 24 hours.  The rate is increased to &euro;47.59 for a 24 hour duty.  Security Duty allowance is paid to all enlisted personnel and to officers up to and including the rank of Commandant. </p>  <p>  The assistance provided by the Defence Forces for the duration of the Papal visit is greatly appreciated and acknowledged by myself and my colleagues in Government.</p></reply>

In this context, it is important that an appropriate balance is maintained between personnel costs and equipment investment.</p>  <p>  In December 2011, the Government decided to stabilise the strength ceiling of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) at 9,500 personnel.  The Defence Budget provides sufficient resources for the full strength of 9,500 personnel and every effort is being made to reach this strength and there are no plans to exceed this figure.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, developing a realistic costing on increasing the establishment to 10,700, is not simply a straight-line calculation.  Achieving and sustaining such an increase would happen over a phased basis and would require the inclusion of other expenditure issues such as the training and accommodation infrastructures for such a larger force, along with training staffs etc., additional equipment, and potentially additional organisational and command structures.  In addition, the issue of where such an increase in personnel was to be applied &ndash; e.g. Air Corps, Naval Service, Army or specialist corps &ndash; would have significant implications in terms of any cost calculation. </p></reply>

Ireland has long been the OECD DAC, Development Assistance Committee, member which provides the greatest percentage of bilateral overseas development aid, ODA, to and through civil society organisations.  In 2016, the Irish percentage was 43%, compared to an OECD DAC average of 15%.  Indeed, in 2017, 51% of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral ODA, over &euro;165 million was channelled to and through NGOs, an even higher percentage.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, prudential management of these Irish Aid funds is imperative to optimise the benefits for the poorest and most vulnerable and to ensure accountability to the taxpayer.  In particular, payments are dependent upon compliance with terms and conditions of grants, including receipt of satisfactory reports on previous funding and achievement of benchmarks.  My officials continue to engage actively with all NGOs in receipt of Irish Aid funding in relation to fulfilment of requirements for remaining payments this year.</p>  <p>  The Department has piloted a new grant management system across Irish Aid funds this year to ensure that programmes and projects funded by Irish Aid meet the increasing level of due diligence required both nationally and internationally.  Given the wide range of grant programmes which Irish Aid administers, it is not correct to generalise about the timing of grants to all NGOs.  Among due diligence requirements, grantees are required to maintain adequate levels of reserves and an appropriate level of dependency on Irish Aid.  Timing of grant disbursal is dependent on a number of factors, not all of which are predictable, including quality of input received from applicants, percentage of successful applicants meeting their benchmarks in a timely manner as well as internal capacity within Irish Aid. </p></reply>

SAFE2 is secure &amp;amp; robust and gives a high degree of assurance regarding the identity of the holder. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service currently requires evidence that first time adult applicants and those seeking to replace lost, stolen or damaged passports issued prior to 2005 are holders of a PSC.  This measure has been an important step in protecting against fraud and identity theft and in upholding the integrity of the Irish passport.</p>  <p>  All passport applications are subject to the provisions of the Passports Act 2008.  The Act provides, among other things, that a person must be an Irish citizen before a passport can be issued to him/her. In order to meet this legal requirement, each person must demonstrate an entitlement to Irish citizenship in his or her passport application.  The PSC does not verify citizenship.</p>  <p>  Section 7 of the Act requires that the Minister be satisfied as to a person&rsquo;s identity and that the person is an Irish citizen before issuing a passport to that person.  Section 7(2) provides as follows: &ldquo;The Minister may require an applicant for a passport to provide such information as the Minister may require for the purposes of the application and to produce to him or her such documents as he or she considers necessary or expedient to enable him or her to perform the functions of the Minister under this Part.&rdquo; </p></reply>

This roadmap takes stock of the changing international tax environment, outlines the actions Ireland has taken to date and the further actions that will be taken over the coming years to ensure that our corporation tax code is line with international best practices. </p><p>This roadmap also includes details in relation to the transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, ATADs, and actions to be taken with regard to the recommendations from the Review of Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Code, undertaken by Mr Seamus Coffey.  The commitments outlined in the roadmap are primarily about introducing measures to limit aggressive tax planning.  To that extent, the commitments are not expected to have any cost to the Exchequer.</p><p>The Budget 2019 commitments set out in the roadmap include legislation to be introduced in Finance Bill 2018 to introduce controlled foreign company, CFC, rules, with effect from 1 January 2019.  The purpose of CFC rules is to discourage the artificial diversion of income to low tax jurisdictions.  As such they are not designed primarily to raise Exchequer revenue, but rather to modify taxpayer behaviour.</p><p>The final legislative steps required to allow Ireland to complete the ratification of the BEPS multilateral instrument will also be taken in Finance Bill 2018.  The changes introduced to the application of Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaties are primarily anti-avoidance in nature and are aimed at stopping international tax planning strategies known as treaty shopping.  It is not possible to estimate the potential budgetary impact from the changes that will be made to the application of Ireland&rsquo;s tax treaties. </p><p>The roadmap also enumerates further commitments to action over the next 12 to 24 months arising from the ATADs and from the Coffey recommendations, including the introduction of anti-hybrid and anti-reverse hybrid rules; an exit tax; an interest limitation ratio; updating of transfer pricing rules; and further work on mandatory disclosure rules, dispute resolution and implementation of the International Mutual Assistance Bill.</p><p>It will not be possible to estimate the budgetary impact of such measures until the process of designing the measures is significantly further advanced.  As I outlined in the roadmap, the confluence of the OECD BEPS outcomes and the most significant US tax reform in recent history is likely to lead to significant changes in the structure of multinationals over the next number of years.  The purpose of the programme of changes set out in the Roadmap is to ensure that Ireland remains on a sustainable path for growth and investment in this rapidly-changing international tax environment.</p></reply>

Motor vehicles are excluded from this Order because the qualifying provisions for the Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme provide for a refund of VAT and residual vehicle registration tax for qualifying disabled drivers, passengers and organisations.  </p>  <p>  Non-profit groups engaged in non-commercial activity are exempt from VAT under the EU VAT Directive.  This means that they do not register for VAT and cannot recover VAT incurred on goods and services that they purchase.  This non-entitlement to VAT deductibility is a general feature of VAT exemption and there is no provision in either European law or Irish VAT law to allow a zero-rating or exemption for supplies of this nature.  VAT is a tax on consumption and is applied to supplies being made by a person and not to supplies received by them. In this context, it is not possible under EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, to introduce a VAT exemption based on services received, or on the basis of the recipient of a service, nor is it possible to allow for zero rating of such supplies.</p>  <p>  However, in line with my Budget 2018 announcement, a VAT compensation scheme for charities will be introduced in 2019 in respect of VAT expenses incurred in 2018.  Charities will be entitled to a refund of a proportion of their VAT costs based on the level of non-public funding they receive, up to a total capped fund of &euro;5 million.  While the high level principles of the scheme were published on Budget day in 2017, the parameters of the operation of the scheme are being progressed so that guidelines for charities can be published in advance of the 2019 commencement date.</p>  <p>  In relation to the aforementioned Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme, Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 and Statutory Instrument No 55/2018 set out the criteria under which charitable organisations can claim a repayment of VRT and VAT paid on specially constructed or adapted vehicles under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme.</p>  <p>  To qualify under the scheme, an organisation must be a charitable organisation within the meaning of the Charities Act 2009 (No. 6 of 2009), that is &ndash;</p>  <p>  (a -entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of that Act, and</p>  <p>  (b- whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities, and</p>  <p>  (c- in furtherance of that purpose, is engaged in the care and transport of disabled persons.</p>  <p>  An applicant must qualify under all the conditions outlined above and adapted vehicles must be used to transport persons who are severely and permanently physically disabled and who hold a Primary Medical Certificate.  </p></reply>

Most recently, it was discussed at the informal ECOFIN on 8 September 2018.  I welcomed the opportunity to discuss the proposal with my EU counterparts and there was a healthy debate.  While it is clear that there is widespread preference for a global solution, Ministers remain divided on the need for interim EU measures.

It has provided rewarding employment for over 300,000 people directly and a transformation of the enterprise base in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Changes in the US tax system are very relevant for Ireland given the large volume of US investment in Ireland. My officials in the Department of Finance, and the Irish Embassy in the US, continue to monitor the situation regarding US Tax reform and continue to engage with business and others to fully understand the potential impacts of the changes to US taxation.  Further Regulations remain to published by the US Treasury and IRS in respect of how parts of the new US tax rules will operate.</p>  <p>  The level of investment from the US into Ireland cannot be attributed just to corporate tax policy &ndash; that is not a fair reflection of the many other reasons that companies choose to locate in Ireland.  Factors such as availability of physical and technological infrastructure, availability of skilled staff, access to the EU market as well as culture and quality of life are also significant and important considerations.</p>  <p>  US business will always want to have operations in the EU, and Ireland will remain very competitive and attractive as an EU location to invest in and do business from.  US multinationals locating real substantial activity in Ireland will continue to be subject to Irish tax at 12.5% on their profits properly attributable to activity located in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax regime will continue to be competitive while also offering long-term certainty to international business.

The tax commenced on 1 May 2018 and applies to first supplies in the State of SSDs.  SSDs are water and juice based drinks, in ready to consume or concentrated form, that contain added sugar and have a total sugar content of 5 grams or more per 100 millilitres in their ready to consume form.</p>  <p>  The exemption limit for small producers of 13,000 litres per annum is linked to the definition of &lsquo;manufacturer of small quantities of products&rsquo; as laid out in S.I. 559 of 2016 European Union (Provision of Food Information to Consumers) Regulations and is based on the requirements for exemption from EU food labelling obligations as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011.  This provides a firm administrative basis for applying the tax.</p>  <p>  The relatively low limit for the exemption from the SSDT reflects the public health policy rationale, the feedback received from the Public Consultation on the introduction of the SSDT and also the need to comply with State aid rules.</p>  <p>  The public consultation on the introduction of the tax on sugar sweetened drinks in 2016/7 included a question on the application of the tax to small producers.  All of the respondents who replied to this question indicated a preference for not providing exemptions for small producers, whether on public health grounds or to comply with State aid rules.</p>  <p>  The SSDT is part of the government's Obesity Policy and Action Plan aimed at reducing obesity, particularly in children, in the context of high levels of overweight and obesity in Ireland and high levels of consumption of sugar sweetened drinks.  By providing a financial incentive to producers to reformulate their product and to consumers to choose healthier drinks, the Government is seeking to rebalance the sources of energy in people's diet to better align with the HSE's Healthy Eating Guidelines and Food Pyramid.</p>  <p>  Therefore the application of the SSDT should be as broad as possible.  Providing for a higher 'small producer' exemption limit would serve to undermine the public health rationale for the tax and put the European Commission&rsquo;s positive State aid decision on the tax as a whole in doubt.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I have no plans to change the exemption provisions.</p></reply>

The majority of these public servants currently have a compulsory retirement age of 65.</p>  <p>  Primary legislation is required for the new compulsory retirement age to be implemented and to that end, a Bill entitled the Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Bill 2018, was published on Monday 9 July and passed all stages in the Seanad on Tuesday 17 July.  The Bill is being treated as a priority and the intention is to secure enactment of the legislation as early as possible in the current term.</p>  <p>  The main provisions of the Bill are that:</p>  <p>  - The vast majority of public servants recruited prior to 1 April 2004 will have a new compulsory retirement age of 70;</p>  <p>  - Those public servants will continue to accrue retirement benefits up to the new compulsory retirement age of 70, subject to a maximum of 40 years' service;</p>  <p>  - The "uniformed pension fast accrual" group, i.e. Garda&iacute;, Firefighters, Prison Officers and the members of the Permanent Defence Force, will be unaffected by these changes.</p>  <p>  The new compulsory retirement age will not come into effect until the legislation is commenced.  In order to make some accommodation for public servants who reach the age of 65 in the period between the Government Decision of 5 December and the commencement of the necessary legislation, the Government approved some limited interim arrangements which became effective from the date of the Government Decision.  The interim arrangements (which have to respect the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65), through retire and re-hire, enable pre 2004 public servants who reach the age of 65 to remain in employment only until they reach the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory), which is currently 66.</p></reply>

After a comprehensive investigation, they found that "In general, evidence suggests that there are not significant recruitment difficulties to the various large scale public service vocational streams.  However, there are problems in the case of some specific and specialist groups across the public service."</p>  <p>  This conclusion is supported by the strong growth in public service numbers since the ending of the Moratorium.  Between Q4 2013 and Q2 2018 the public service increased by 11% or over 35,000 staff from 288,217 to 322,868.  Included in these numbers are over 12,000 teachers, over 4,300 nurses, nearly 1,500 Garda&iacute; and almost 1,800 doctors and dentists.  Importantly, it should be understood that, this increase has been sufficient to replace all leavers (including retirements) from the public service while still growing overall numbers employed.</p>  <p>  As such the evidence suggests that the public service is a good employer offering competitive terms and conditions including flexible working arrangements, decent pension provisions, fair wages that increase over time and secure employment.</p>  <p>  The second report of the Public Service Pay Commission, published on 4 September, went further and investigated recruitment and retention difficulties in some of the specific areas previously identified, starting with the health sector.  Where a difficulty was identified, the PSPC were to further examine the full range of causal factors, including, remuneration, planned future adjustments to remuneration under the PSSA, supply constraints on qualified staff, career structures, work environment, and HR practices etc.</p>  <p>  The main findings of the report were that there were no generalised recruitment and retention problems in respect of nursing and midwifery but some difficulties exist in meeting workforce requirements in specific areas, that training and promotion are the key influencers of migration and turnover in NCHDs and that there is a general difficulty in recruiting consultants, with certain specialities and locations experiencing more significant problems.</p>  <p>  There is a commitment between Public Service employers and staff representatives to meet within four weeks to discuss issues around implementation of recommendations outlined in the Report. Arrangements are being made for this engagement.</p>  <p>  Finally it is worth noting that the next report of the Public Service Pay Commission will explore recruitment and retention issues impacting on other grades and sectors of the Public Service, including the Defence Forces.  It is expected that this report will be completed at the end of 2018 or early 2019.</p></reply>

The OPW Event Management Unit worked with a dedicated Business and Community liaison team and engaged in a detailed process of communication with local residents and businesses with the following actions: </p><p>- 26 July - 200 A4 Flyers and business cards distributed to City centre businesses.</p><p>- 8 &amp;amp; 9 August - Business Briefings in Printworks Dublin Castle.

Attended by 120 people.</p><p>- 14 &ndash; 21 August &ndash; An Post mail distribution of 144,000 booklets containing list of road closures, &lsquo;Dear Community&rsquo; letter and contact information.  These were delivered to residents and businesses in the City to advise them of restrictions in place that may impact them in advance of and during the Papal Visit.  Copies of the booklet were also available from Dublin City Council,  Dublin Town Kiosks, local Garda stations and from the OPW offices in Phoenix Park.</p><p>- 18 &amp;amp; 19 August - 60 x A3 full colour posters distributed in Smithfield, Stoneybatter and Navan Road areas re forthcoming community briefing.</p><p>- 20 August - 130 businesses and residents attended Community Briefing in Parish Hall, Prussia Street, Stoneybatter, D.7</p><p>- 20 &ndash; 27 August &ndash; Dedicated Papal Visit Helpline live in Dublin City Council.</p><p>- 23 August - 4,900 full colour A4 double-sided leaflets delivered to each of the seven designated pedestrian routes giving advance notification to residents and businesses of the large numbers of pedestrians expected to walk along these roads and the suspension of parking on their roads. </p><p>The widespread road closures around the Phoenix Park and at Knock, which probably had the greatest impact on local residents, were implemented entirely to ensure the health and safety of all those anticipated to be attending the events as well as of the residents themselves.</p><p>A post event brief, involving all Agencies involved, has already taken place.</p></reply>

Over the lifetime of the plan 50,000 learners will register on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes.  This represents a more than doubling of activity by 2020.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to expanding the apprenticeship model into new sectors of the economy.  Arising from our two calls for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 and 2017 fourteen new apprenticeships have been developed in a wide range of sectors, including financial services, engineering, ICT, hospitality, logistics and accounting.  Further new apprenticeships across a wide variety of sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture will get underway later in 2018 and throughout 2019.</p>  <p>  As well as developments in new apprenticeships, as the employment and economic situation continues to improve, we have seen strong growth in registrations across the craft trades nationally during 2017 with 4,508 at year end, which represents a 20% increase on 2016.</p>  <p>  This Government is also prioritising the expansion of traineeship offerings.  To date, an additional thirteen new traineeships have been developed in areas such as hospitality, engineering, logistics and animation. These new programmes will complement the existing programmes on offer.  The programmes have been designed by ETBs working in collaboration with employers to meet identified skill needs.  In addition, eligibility criteria on participation has been broadened to include school leavers, older learners and people in employment.</p>  <p>  Apprenticeships and traineeships have a good regional spread and the delivery of Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship will bring real opportunities for learners and employers throughout the country.</p></reply>

The entry requirements and selection criteria for entry to academic programmes, including medicine, is a matter for, and at the discretion of, each higher education institution.  This applies to both EU and non-EU students. </p>  <p>  In relation to EU students, medical schools operate within a quota of places at both undergraduate entry and graduate entry.  The quota arose from the Fottrell Report and was determined by medical workforce planning needs.</p>  <p>  Non-EU students are admitted outside this quota and through a separate entry stream.  Applications are generally made directly to the University through the international admissions office and the CAO is not generally utilised for this purpose.</p>  <p>  Depending on their country of origin, non-EU applicants are required to meet certain entry requirements such as relevant secondary school or college entry qualification, international examination scores (e.g. International Baccalaureate, A-Level) and demonstrated English language proficiency (e.g. IELTS, TOEFL).  Courses such as medicine may have their own additional subject requirements as well.</p></reply>

It gives participants opportunities to improve their general level of education, gain certification, develop their skills and prepare for employment, self-employment and further education and training.  The scheme is operated through local Education and Training Boards and is aimed in particular at unemployed people who are early school-leavers.</p>  <p>  The student that the deputy refers to contacted Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board requesting to undertake subjects of Mathematics, Business and Economics for the Leaving Certificate.

It is the case that many teachers who would have been available to carry out substitution work are now gaining permanent and long term contracts.</p>  <p>  I am aware of reports that some schools are experiencing difficulties in finding substitute teachers.  In order to ease the situation, in the last school year I suspended the limits that teachers on career break can work as substitutes.  Schools were also reminded that, in considering career break applications, the needs of pupils should take precedence and they must take account of the availability of appropriate qualified replacement teachers.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, earlier this year I established the Teacher Supply Steering Group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department.  The Group is considering the issues that relate to teacher supply, including: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group is supported by a number of working groups which are looking in more detail at the issues under these broad headings.  The matter of supply panels is part of that consideration.  In addition, officials of my Department are engaging directly with the teacher unions.  As part of that engagement, the supply panel issue was the subject of an initial discussion with INTO and it is intended to have a follow up meeting on the matter with the union in the near future.</p></reply>

This applies to providers operating in the areas of further or higher education and training.  QQI is undertaking a re-engagement process with its legacy providers, the purpose of which is to renew this relationship and to ensure that providers have in place fit for purpose quality assurance arrangements that serve the needs of learners.  This is essential in order to ensure that all education and training activities meet appropriate quality standards and meet the learning objectives of participants.</p>  <p>  QQI, unlike other awarding bodies, does not provide programmes and related assessment methodologies to providers.  Instead, providers who engage with QQI must have their own capacity to design programmes and assessment methodologies based on awards standards set down by QQI and linked to the National Framework of Qualifications.  Through the process of re-engagement, legacy providers will have the opportunity to demonstrate that they have this capacity and equally importantly, that it is sustainable in the long-term.  This will help underpin the credibility and reputation of the education and training opportunities across the broader spectrum of the further education and training sector and contribute to the further development of the appropriate pathways through that system.  Important considerations that arise in that regard relate, for example, to the capacity that providers will be required to put in place to ensure that the infrastructure required to develop and deliver programmes are consistent with national standards and facilitate the assessment of the achievement of stated learning objectives by learners.</p>  <p>  QQI has worked closely with stakeholders from the Community and Voluntary Sector to identify appropriate solutions that balance the need to continue to facilitate this sector&rsquo;s education providers to support hard-to-reach learners, with the responsibility to ensure that all providers that engage with QQI are equipped to meet the same robust quality assurance standards.  </p>  <p>  The policy informing QQI's fee structure has been subject to extensive consultation and provides that the application of fees will be consistent, transparent and equitable.  It is also important that it reflects the amount and complexity of the work undertaken by QQI.  The level of fees to be applied for the purposes of re-engagement has been subject to extensive deliberation to ensure that they are consistent with this policy and are applied equitably.  It was determined during this process that it would not be possible to develop a fee waiver scheme which would be fair, equitable, objective and justifiable given the diversity of providers in this sector.  On that basis, a range of fees have been formally approved for this purpose and were published by QQI in July of this year. </p></reply>

In the 2017/18 school year over 117,000 children, including over 12,000 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 4,500 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually at a total cost of almost &euro;190 million in 2017.  </p>  <p>  There are 11 Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles operating to various schools in County Louth and there are 145 Contractor&rsquo;s vehicles operating to various schools in County Louth.  </p>  <p>  In order to be considered roadworthy a bus must pass an annual Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test (CVRT), conducted under the auspices of the Road Safety Authority (RSA) at approved test centres around the country.  Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport providers are contractually obliged to ensure that their vehicle has an up to date roadworthiness certificate issued by an RSA accredited test centre when a contract is signed.  The contractor is obliged to keep their roadworthiness certificate current and up to date at all times and provide Bus &Eacute;ireann with evidence of this. </p>  <p>  All school buses in service - procured by Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide services under the School Transport Scheme - that are subject to roadside inspections, must have current roadworthiness certification at the time of inspection. </p>  <p>  A detailed contract is put in place for all contracted services &ndash; which includes numerous safety-related items.  There is a strict process in place before any vehicle or driver is added to the approved list for provision of services under the School Transport Scheme. Required documentation is checked and copies are held by Bus &Eacute;ireann offices.  This documentation includes insurance and insurance indemnity, valid Road Passenger Transport Operator Licence (with required vehicles added), valid Certificate of Roadworthiness (CRW), appropriate valid Public Service Vehicle licence (large/small) (PSV) and evidence of Tax Clearance.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann contracts also include a stipulation that requires all contractors to have planned maintenance programmes, with checking intervals of not more than six weeks.  Every Contractor is also responsible as an individual bus operator, licensed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, to ensure they comply with legislation in all respects.</p>  <p>  In addition to statutory requirements, Bus &Eacute;ireann arranges for additional sample auditing of contractors vehicles operating under the Scheme, throughout the year.  These additional quality assurance checks are carried out by independent vehicle inspection auditors, on both a targeted and random basis.  Almost one in five buses contracted to the School Transport Scheme are audited under these quality assurance checks, which are designed to monitor the condition and roadworthiness status of each vehicle checked. </p>  <p>  Any vehicles that fall short of the standards required during the audits are immediately withdrawn from further service until all identified issues are rectified by the contractor.  If contractors are found not to have carried out the required improvements to their fleet and systems, they face penalties up to and including termination of contract.</p>  <p>  Figures recently released to RT&Eacute; under FOI stated that 51% of the buses inspected by the RSA in the past year failed roadside safety checks.  Almost a third of them were found to have had major or dangerous defects.  It should be noted the figures do not exclusively pertain to operators contracted on the School Transport Scheme.  Many buses included in the figures were operating on privately engaged school services or other private hire work at the time of inspection.  The RSA have also acknowledged that the inspections were targeted at operators of known concern and the published figures reflect this.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann have robust requirements and checks in place to ensure a high level of safety at all times and in this regard they will be issuing a communication to TDs and Senators in the coming days to provide information on these safety requirements and checks.</p></reply>

Enhanced rates are payable to Special Schools and Special Classes attached to mainstream primary schools, the rates are determined by the special education needs category of the class. The enhanced capitation rate for primary ASD special classes is &euro;840 per pupil (inclusive of the mainstream rate of &euro;170). </p>  <p>  The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second-level system. At the core of all arrangements is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding.</p>  <p>  The standard per capita grant for voluntary secondary schools is &euro;296 per pupil. At Post Primary level, an enhanced capitation rate of &euro;190 per pupil is currently only paid in respect of pupils enrolled in special classes for mild or moderate general learning disability.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that the National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (2016) included a recommendation to extend the enhanced level of capitation grant to post-primary schools with special classes on the same basis as primary schools to assist them with the increased running costs associated with these classes. </p>  <p>  My Department has convened an Implementation Group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and representatives from other Departments and agencies to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered.  </p>  <p>  While a number of the recommendations have already been partially or substantially implemented, work is planned on the implementation of the remaining recommendations. </p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to prepare a progress report setting out expected timeframes for full implementation and I expect that report in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

This decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment in consultation with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). </p><p>Students enrolling in specialised placements must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals stating that: </p><p>- S/he has a disability (in line with the designation of the special placement in question) and</p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a specialised setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) plans and co-ordinates the provision of educational support services to children with special educational needs, in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>The enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p><p>Accordingly, the NCSE advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible. Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement, for the 2018/19 school year, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process. </p><p>It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Educational Training Board or to the Secretary General of my Department.</p><p>The NCSE works in collaboration with the Educational Welfare Services (EWS) of the Child and Family Agency which is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child or can offer assistance where a child is out of school. The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWO). Contact details are available at .</p><p>Where there is no placement available for a child with Special Educational Needs, my Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive up to 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available. </p><p>As the matter raised by the Deputy refers to a particular child, I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be forwarded to the National Council for Special Education for their attention and direct reply.</p></reply>

Following the finalisation of a detailed procurement process, a contract was signed in May 2018 with CoreHR for the provision of a payroll and TandS system.  This system will be used to run the payroll function for all ETBs once the ESBS Centre goes live in 2019.  Ultimately, this new system will pay the 27,000 payees that are currently being paid by 16 ETBs across Ireland.  The migration of each of the 16 ETB payroll functions will happen in waves with the first of these migration waves due to take place in 2019.  As each of the 16 ETB payrolls migrate to the ESBS Centre all their employees will have access to online payslips only.</p></reply>

I thank the Deputy for his shared interest in this serious public safety concern.</p>  <p>  My Department has consulted with a considerable number of Government Departments and public bodies over the past number of months to identify a number of relevant pieces of legislation, which have been brought to the attention of the Attorney Generals' Office, to determine whether any legislative amendments are necessary to assist in curbing activity insofar as scramblers and quad bikes are concerned, without giving rise to any unintended negative legislative consequences.  I will be happy to provide the Deputy with a further update on this matter on receipt of a detailed consideration of this issue from the Attorney General's Office.</p>  <p>  My officials are engaged in further consultations with local authorities and local community groups in the context of the positive engagement fostered by local authorities with local communities, such as the provision of a designated area where such vehicles could be used in a safe environment.  In this regard, my Department participates in the taskforce on this issue established by the Dublin local authorities, which met on 21 June and, most recently, on 13 September 2018.</p>  <p>  An important element of this issue is the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes by minors.  The supply of mechanically propelled vehicles to persons under 16 and 17 (depending on the vehicle) constitute offences under Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act 2004.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to actively supporting any positive actions that can be pursued to counteract the serious public safety issues associated with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, which was established in 2015, continues to lead out the policing strategy for tackling drugs by demand reduction and supply reduction strategies.  In this regard the Bureau continues its policy of working with Garda Divisional Drug Units nationwide in tackling supply reduction at local level. </p><p>This work is further supported by other national units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, in targeting persons involved in the illicit sale and supply of drugs.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.  Multi-disciplinary approaches are also utilised to ensure that those involved in illicit activity are effectively targeted including through the use of the proceeds of crime legislation, money laundering legislation and the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I am informed that this approach adopts good practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and in utilising available criminal law to its fullest extent in tackling all forms of organised crime, including drug trafficking.</p><p>We have also seen unprecedented international cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing services in other jurisdictions leading to important arrests and drug seizures. </p><p>Underpinning all these measures is this Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.</p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation including the Divisional Drugs Units.

Applications processed in the seven Visa Offices abroad generally have a shorter processing time.</p>  <p>  The Policy Document on Family Reunification published in December 2013 contains a stated business target that visa applications to join Irish citizens should be dealt with within six months of receipt of application.  However, it should be noted that this is a business target and does not constitute a legal obligation.  The business target reflects the detailed and often complex assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification.</p>  <p>  While the Visa Office endeavours to have applications of this nature processed as quickly as possible, processing times for visas can vary based on a number of factors such as the number of applications, seasonal fluctuations - this for example being the busiest time of the year generally for making visa applications, individual circumstances, the complexity of applications, whether further information or investigation is required, and the resources available.  Any delays in achieving the business target are primarily related to the processing of more complex cases where the provision of additional documentation is requested or where detailed assessments of family rights under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights are required. </p>  <p>  The central concern, as with all visa services worldwide, in deciding on visa applications is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.

That gave rise to a caseload of around 10,500 applications which had to be assessed very carefully to ensure that any fraudulent applications or potential abuses of the Directive are detected and dealt with appropriately.  The majority of these have now been processed, and explains the high figures of applications and refusals for certain countries in those years.  </p><p>Most of the sponsors in these particular cases were United Kingdom nationals who came here claiming to be exercising EU Treaty Rights.  INIS had serious concerns about many of these cases, particularly as they appeared to be using the Common Travel Area to circumvent national UK immigration rules for family reunification.  However, under the Directive genuine movement must be taking place by the EU national, such as taking up employment, etc.  A series of measures were taken by INIS including defending cases in the Courts, working with the Garda National Immigration Bureau to address abuses, and working in close cooperation with UK counterparts who subsequently made changes to their laws.</p><p>Since these measures were taken, the numbers of such new applicants dropped off dramatically in 2017 and this year to date.  Approximately 97% of those 10,500 applications have now been decided, and over 95% refused/withdrawn with a significant number processed this year and thus not reflected in the processing figures in the following tables.  </p><p>Legal proceedings in relation to a number of such applications have been before the courts, and a referral was made by the Court of the Appeal to the European Court of Justice.</p><p>More generally, the central concern, as with all visa services worldwide, in deciding on visa applications is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.

They stated at that time that they were the spouse of a citizen of Portugal.  </p>  <p>  This application was refused on 19 April 2011 as the person concerned failed to submit the documentation requested of them.  The applicant sought a review of that decision and, on 16 August 2011, they were informed that the initial decision had been set aside and that they were to be provided with a residence card as a family member of an EU citizen &ndash; a Stamp 4EUFam - for a period of five years.</p>  <p>  On 06 September 2016, the person concerned submitted an application to retain their residence card on an individual and personal basis.  However, they were advised on 15 July 2017 that their application had been refused.  Based on information available to INIS, it was clear that the EU citizen had departed the State in 2013.  They had ceased to exercise EU Treaty rights in the State in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations and Directive at that time.  As the Union citizen had not been exercising EU Treaty Rights in the State in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 6(3) of the Regulations since 2013, the applicant&rsquo;s derived right of residence under the Regulations ceased from that time also.  Moreover, the applicant did not retain any entitlement to a residence card under Regulation 10(2) of the Regulations or Regulation 9(3) of the Regulations.</p>  <p>  The person concerned requested a review of that decision on 16 August 2017, this application is currently under consideration.  The applicant was provided with temporary permission to remain in the State while their application was under consideration, and this temporary permission will be renewed in the coming days. </p>  <p>  INIS will correspond with the person concerned should further documentation, information, or clarification be required.  Applications are dealt with in strict chronological order, and a decision will issue to the person concerned in due course.

Building on the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, the Working Group considered proposals to enhance the approach to tackling low level offenders and effectively addressing their offending behaviour through a Community Justice Intervention type programme.  This would be a diversion from the courts system in a way that has the potential to respond more effectively to one-off and repeat, low level offending with the emphasis on speedy processing aimed at reducing the risk of re-offending and would also offer quick referral to the necessary services.</p>  <p>  My Department wishes to build on this work and continues to examine a number of possibilities, including the creation of a conditional cautioning system of which there are a number of models, which continue to remain under careful consideration. </p></reply>

However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to take all forms of anti-social and drug-related behaviour very seriously. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities and deploy Garda resources accordingly to address any problems that arise.</p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in Part 13 of the Act, for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>  Anti-social behaviour has no place in a civilised society. For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a very substantial budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and close to &euro;100 million has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018, which inter alia supports Garda activity to tackle these types of problems.</p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle these problems head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone. Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding. These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by wider society in general. We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. </p>  <p>  Clearly, Garda visibility is very important and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently undertaking a programme of accelerated recruitment, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a strengthened service through the Five Year High Level Reform and Workforce Plan, which will see an overall workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. Since 2014, approximately 2,200 new members have attested and been assigned to duties in communities throughout the country. By the end of this year it is expected Garda numbers will have increased to approximately 14,000 for the first time since 2011.</p></reply>

We are agreed that it is essential that value for money is achieved with the resources at his disposal and insofar as the emerging overrun in 2018 is concerned, he will be working with his senior management team to identify any measures that can be taken to ameliorate the situation.  My Department will, of course, continue to engage with Garda management on the issue over the remainder of the year.</p></reply>

Vetting is carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016.</p>  <p>  Vetting checks are conducted by the Vetting Bureau for each new application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that at present, 80% of overall vetting applications are being processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days. This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations. The e-vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-vetting system to do so. In circumstances where there is such a sustained reduction in processing times, the issue of vetting &ldquo;transferability&rdquo; is largely obviated. </p>  <p>  That said, the Deputy will wish to be aware that the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 provides at section 12 for certain circumstances where organisations can share a single vetting disclosure where this is agreed to by the vetting applicant and by the organisations in question.</p></reply>

Section 5 of the 2009 Act requires my Department to undertake a review of the operation of the Act and this review is currently ongoing.</p>  <p>  The parameters of the review were published on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality as well as a call for submissions for a public consultation on the operation of the Defamation Act.  Submissions to this public consultation were also published on the Department&rsquo;s website. In announcing the review, I stated that the central focus for the review is to ensure that our law strikes the correct balance between the right to freedom of expression in a democratic society, and an individual&rsquo;s right to protect their good name and privacy against unfounded attack &ndash; rights which are protected both under our Constitution and under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  Amongst other matters, the review will address whether any changes should be made to the level or type of damages which may be awarded in defamation cases, or to the factors to be taken into account in making that determination. In addition, the review will address whether any changes should be made to the respective roles of judge and jury in High Court defamation cases. The review will further address the adequacy of the current range of defences under the 2009 Act, including the defence of fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public interest.</p>  <p>  My officials have completed extensive work on the review, which includes a comparative examination of the law of defamation in other jurisdictions, including in relation to assessment of damages and the respective roles of judge and jury. The timeframe for the review was extended due to requests by stakeholders for more time to prepare their submissions, the complexity of the issues under consideration, the wide scope of the submissions received, other urgent legislative priorities for the Department, and significant intervening judgments of relevance from the European Court of Human Rights and the Supreme Court.</p>  <p>  The review will culminate in a report to that will be submitted to me and that will include a range of options for reform of the 2009 Act. My officials have informed me that it is expected that the draft report with options for reform will be submitted to me before the end of 2018.</p></reply>

To achieve this the Government has put a plan in place to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 Garda personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.

Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda Resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The official categorisation as a Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs. </p><p>Appointments to the rank of Sergeant are a matter for the Commissioner under section 14 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.</p><p>I am further advised by the Commissioner that there is currently a competition in train for promotion to the rank of Sergeant with the aim of bringing the strength to 2,000 as agreed under the Employment Control Framework.

In this instance I am advised by the Garda authorities that a removal was conducted on behalf of the property&rsquo;s owner who had obtained an injunction order from the High Court directing people who had been occupying the premises to vacate it.  The action was taken by a private firm acting for the owner of the premises on foot of this High Court Order.  </p>  <p>  The law and procedures governing the execution of Court Orders are contained in the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts and the Rules of Court made thereunder and any dispute in relation to the enforcement of a Court Order is solely a matter for the Courts. </p>  <p>  Operational issues are a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I am informed that the role of the Garda&iacute; who were in attendance at the scene that evening was to uphold the law in facilitating the High Court order being carried out safely, to ensure public order and to facilitate peaceful protest.  I understand that Community Garda&iacute; were deployed, and later based on the situation on the ground, supported by a Garda Public Order Unit, to allow the High Court order to be enforced, keep the peace and facilitate a public protest.</p>  <p>  While I understand the discomfort at seeing Garda&iacute; working with their faces covered &ndash; and the Garda Commissioner has made a statement on this issue - we must be conscious also of the difficulties the Garda&iacute; face in managing protests and enforcing the law, including racial abuse and online threats and intimidation that came to light at the weekend.  Such threats are utterly unacceptable and are, rightly, being investigated.  The Garda&iacute;, who work on our behalf, need support from the public not abuse and intimidation.</p>  <p>  I know that everyone in this House will agree that the right to protest is a fundamental one in any democracy, and one which must be protected and facilitated.  However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Garda&iacute; involved were enforcing the law. </p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has made a statement in relation to the protest and I understand he has requested a report from the Assistant Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), to see what lessons can be learned from the event.  I also note that the Policing Authority will be discussing this matter with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have asked the Garda authorities to bring any additional relevant information to my attention. </p></reply>

Further details on the student permission can be found on the INIS website.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances, persons in the State for 90 days for the purposes of tourism can have their permission extended on a case-by-case basis.  Extension beyond the 90 day tourist permission is given in exceptional humanitarian circumstances (e.g. serious illness).

This is an increase of approximately 2% over the allocation for 2017.</p>  <p>  In terms of capital investment, &euro;342 million, including &euro;217 million in additional funding under the Capital Plan 2016-2021, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in delivering professional policing and security services for the community.  This investment will allow delivery of a broad range of projects associated with the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme. </p>  <p>  The Capital Plan 2016-2021 also provides &euro;46 million for investment in the Garda Fleet to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose fleet.  This is additional to the investment of almost &euro;30 million in the fleet in the period 2013 to 2015.  In total, some 2,000 new vehicles have been added to the Garda fleet in the period 2013 to end of 2017.</p>  <p>  Significant investment is also being made in addressing deficiencies in the Garda estate.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is an ambitious 5-year programme, based on agreed Garda priorities, involving over &euro;60 million exchequer funding and benefitting over thirty locations around the country.  The cell refurbishment programme has already completed works at 80 locations nationwide.  And this is in addition to the provision of over &euro;100 million for the development of 3 new Divisional and Regional Headquarters at Wexford, Galway and Dublin (Kevin Street) each of which has now been completed and entered into operational use. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Garda Air Support Unit was established in September 1997 with the delivery of a Pilatus Britten-Norman BN 2T-4S Defender 4000 fixed wing aircraft and a Eurocopter AS355N Eceuriel helicopter.  In 2001 the Unit acquired a second helicopter - a Eurocopter EC 135 T2.  In 2007 the Eceuriel helicopter was replaced by a second EC135 T2+. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the question of prioritising the upgrading or replacement of these craft is in the first instance for the Commissioner, in the context of the above investment and his operational priorities.  My Department will of course continue to engage with Garda management in relation to current and capital resource needs.</p></reply>

However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to take all forms of anti-social and drug-related behaviour very seriously.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities and deploy Garda resources accordingly to address any problems that arise.</p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.  I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in Part 13 of the Act, for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>  Anti-social behaviour has no place in a civilised society.  For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a very substantial budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and close to &euro;100 million has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018, which inter alia supports Garda activity to tackle these types of problems.</p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle these problems head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone.  Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding.  These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by wider society in general.  We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. </p>  <p>  Clearly, Garda visibility is very important and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently undertaking a programme of accelerated recruitment, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a strengthened service through the Five Year High Level Reform and Workforce Plan, which will see an overall workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members.  Since 2014, approximately 2,200 new members have attested and been assigned to duties in communities throughout the country.  By the end of this year it is expected Garda numbers will have increased to approximately 14,000 for the first time since 2011.</p></reply>

Where specific skills prove difficult to source within the State and EEA, an employment permit may be sought by an employer to hire a non-EEA national. </p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed in part through the operation of the highly skilled and ineligible occupation lists for the purpose of grant of employment permits.  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research compiled in the annual National Skills Bulletin and the annual Vacancy Overview Report, undertaken by the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs and coordinated by the National Skills Council.  This data, in tandem with a public consultation process which will involve the submission of evidence based cases for inclusion on, or removal from the HSEOL and ICEL, will form the basis of the bi-annual review process. </p>  <p>  Care workers are currently on the Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL).  In order to have an occupation considered for removal from this list, there would need to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to shortages across the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and/or employment conditions.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed evidence-based case for removal of care workers from the ineligible list, would then need to be put forward by the Department of Health, as the lead Department for the sector, to my Department for review and consideration. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the changed economy and labour market of today as we move clearly and strongly out of the downturn, my Department recently completed a review of the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system at my request.  The report of the review will be published shortly providing recommendations on a framework for the future operation of the employment permits regime.  Following that publication, the next review of the lists of occupations for employment permits is scheduled to be conducted in the Autumn.  </p>  <p>  Employment permit policy is part of the response to addressing skills deficits which exist and are likely to continue into the medium term, but it is not intended over the longer term to act as a substitute for meeting the challenge of up-skilling the State&rsquo;s resident workforce, with an emphasis on the process of lifelong learning, and on maximising the potential of EEA nationals to fill our skills deficits.</p>  <p>  Planning, in relation to the health care workforce, is led by the Department of Health and it has agreed a framework for healthcare manpower planning; the guidance of that Department is key to developments in relation to the supply of health care assistants including the establishment of national standards and a register for home care workers.</p></reply>

The LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, equestrian centres as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. </p><p>For anyone interested in starting or growing a business, the LEOs may be able to offer &lsquo;soft&rsquo; support in the form of training (e.g. a Start Your Own Business course); a mentor to work with the business proposer; or targeted programmes such as Lean for Micro (to help boost business productivity and competitiveness).</p><p>Micro-enterprises may also avail of the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) from the LEOs.  The Scheme offers the opportunity for businesses to develop their website or digital marketing strategy by availing of vouchers of up to &euro;2,500 or 50% of eligible expenditure.</p><p>Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEO to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. Successful applicants can avail of a more favourable interest rate from MFI if they make their application through the LEO.</p><p>I should also draw your attention to the &lsquo;Supporting SMEs&rsquo; Online Tool, which is a cross-governmental initiative to help start-ups navigate the range of Government business supports for which they could be eligible.  The tool is available at <i><i>www.supportingsmes.ie</i></i>.  By answering the eight questions in the Online Tool, a small business will, in one location, be able to:</p><p>- find out which of the over 170 Government business supports from 27 different Government Departments, Agencies and Initiatives are available to them;</p><p>- obtain information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit;</p><p>- identify their nearest Local Enterprise Office where they can discuss the outcomes of the guide further;</p><p>- download all these filtered results into a document for their further use. </p><p>The Deputy should be aware that the centre may be eligible for capital funding by my colleague Minister Ring through the LEADER programme, depending on the type of operation being funded.</p></reply>

It is expected that the General Scheme of a Bill to give effect to this decision will be published shortly. </p>  <p>  Changing the structure of the ODCE from an office to a statutory agency will provide greater autonomy to the agency and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.  Sourcing of expertise and specialist staff will be enhanced under the agency model.  The resourcing requirements of the Agency will be considered in the context of the annual Revised Estimates Volume (REV) process.</p></reply>

The first reported case of narcolepsy as a possible consequence of the Pandemrix vaccination was identified by the Swedish pharmacovigilance authority in August 2010.  The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), being the relevant regulatory authority for Pandemrix, continually monitored the reported adverse reactions of Pandemrix and advised member states accordingly.</p><p>It is important to remember the context in which vaccination against influenza type A (H1N1) was introduced.  On 11 June 2009, following consideration by its Emergency Committee, the WHO raised the Influenza type A (H1N1) alert to Pandemic level 6 which officially declares a pandemic.  In Ireland, children and young adults were the most affected groups.  Eighty percent of cases were less than 35 years of age.  More than 1,000 cases of confirmed Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza were hospitalised and 100 people were admitted to Intensive Care Units.  There were 29 deaths, all but two of which were in &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups and most had other significant underlying medical conditions.</p><p>The Department of Health activated the National Plan for Pandemic Influenza and, based on the advices of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee; &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups were prioritised for vaccination.  Vaccination of children was prioritised as the rates of influenza were highest in those groups at that time.  The public pandemic vaccination campaign ended on 31 March 2010.  Over 1.1 million pandemic vaccinations were recorded giving a 25% uptake for the total population.  Since the 2010/2011 influenza season H1N1 has been incorporated in the seasonal flu vaccine used in Ireland.</p><p>A copy of the report can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i>health.gov.ie/blog/publications/final-report-of-the-national-narcolepsy-study-steering-committee-2/</i>. </p></reply>

Following  consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time.  A new Transport Support Payment Scheme remains a priority and we intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between ourselves, in due course. </p>  <p>  With regard to the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment.  The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020.  Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

In this report the Commission recognised that the implementation of the settlement of the 2008 Consultant Contract claim, while necessary of itself, will serve to highlight further the differential in pay between the pre-existing cadre of consultants and new entrants. It stated that the aggregate level of vacancies for consultant posts at the end of 2017 and evidence of recruitment campaigns with very low levels of applications, suggest a general difficulty recruiting consultants and that a number of factors including the two-tier pay system was among a number of factors raised with it as affecting recruitment. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has noted the process underway regarding the extended salary scales for new entrants across the public service under Section 4 of the Public Service Stability Agreement. Discussions are ongoing with union interests in relation to the new entrant issue and it has confirmed that the outcome to these discussions will encompass the consultants hired on new contracts after 2012. It has also noted that the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission has proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential between pre-existing consultants and new entrant consultants which has increased following the settlement of the 2008 Consultant Contract claim. </p></reply>

The Cabinet Committee on Health, chaired by the Taoiseach will provide overall strategic direction and will oversee implementation, ensuring leadership at the highest level.</p>  <p>  A High Level Delivery Board comprising the Secretaries General of the Departments of Health, Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform, the CEO of the HSE and the Sl&aacute;intecare Executive Director will be established to ensure effective delivery of agreed plans and resourcing of the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.</p>  <p>  A Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office has recently been established in the Department of Health, which will drive the implementation of the Strategy. The office is led by an Executive Director with vast experience of large scale change and it will be resourced with a team with the appropriate skill mix to deliver the reform programme. The Office will establish the programme of reform as approved by Government and put in place the governance arrangements, processes, structures and resources to implement it.</p></reply>

The HSE has completed the first phase of their work in relation to the 50 agencies identified as part of the WRC process.  This exercise has shown that of the agencies who returned data, a majority did apply pay reductions of some form.  It also showed that some agencies made some form of pay restoration between 2016 and 2018.</p>  <p>  Two conciliation meetings took place between the parties at the WRC in July 2018. Unfortunately, the unions withdrew from this process and SIPTU indicated its intention to proceed with industrial action on 18 September 2018.  </p>  <p>  However, I am pleased to say that on 14 September, SIPTU agreed to the deferral of industrial action in favour of reconvening talks on the issues in dispute at the WRC.

The Act provides a robust framework of public safety assurance by requiring that the pharmacist is subject to mandatory CPD, Fitness to Practice, a Code of Conduct and a Core Competency Framework</p>  <p>  A clinical governance framework governing the operation of registered Retail Pharmacy Businesses is created by Sections 26, 27, 28 and 29 of the Pharmacy Act 2007, and Regulations made under Section 18 of the Act further elucidate the specific responsibilities of the pharmacy owner, the superintendent pharmacist, the supervising pharmacist and the registered pharmacist. </p>  <p>  Under the Pharmacy Act 2007, the sale and supply of medicinal products must be carried out by or under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist at all times. Section 30 of the Act allows however for an exceptional circumstance where a registered pharmaceutical assistant may act on behalf of a registered pharmacist during the temporary absence of the registered pharmacist. </p>  <p>  Section 30 also permits the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) to make rules as to:  </p>  <p>1. What may or may not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist; and </p>  <p>2. What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.</p>  <p>  In June, the Council of the Society approved for issuance for public consultation the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018. This public consultation commenced on 17 July and ran until 14 August and afforded any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the public consultation phase, I understand that the Council of the PSI will consider the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its next meeting scheduled on the 20th September 2018. The results of the public consultation undertaken in this regard will be available to the Council. In circumstances where the Council approve these draft rules (with/without amendment), these will then be forwarded to me for my consideration and consent in line with requirements of Section 30 of the Act. </p>  <p>  The Pharmacy Act 2007 does not currently make provision for mandatory CPD for registered Pharmaceutical Assistants, or for application of the Fitness to Practice framework as specified in Part 6 of the Act; these two criteria are distinct and separate from the registered pharmaceutical assistant being in a position to act in the temporary absence of the pharmacist. </p></reply>

Tobacco Free Ireland sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free (i.e. with a prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025.   </p>  <p>  Tobacco Free Ireland contains a number of recommendations to assist smokers in quitting tobacco use.  One of those recommendations is to examine the evidence regarding the outcomes of the use of Nicotine Replacement Therapy ('NRT') and other approaches.  </p>  <p>  My Department requested HIQA to undertake a Health Technology Assessment ('HTA') of the clinical and cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical smoking cessation products and services. The HTA was published in 2017 and found that all the pharmacological interventions were effective compared to no treatment and that a prescription only drug called varenicline was the most effective drug on its own. However, the HTA also found that using a combination of varenicline and NRT was the most effective pharmacological intervention and that people using this combination were over three and a half times more likely to quit than those who were in a control group and did not receive this treatment. </p>  <p>  Group behavioural therapy, individual counselling, intensive advice and telephone support were all found to be effective behavioural interventions with group therapy found to be the most effective of these interventions. The addition of a behavioural intervention to a pharmacological intervention improved the effectiveness of the intervention.</p>  <p>  The HTA recommended that smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of varenicline, either alone or in combination with NRT, for smokers who want to use a pharmacological support. </p>  <p>  In relation to e-cigarettes and vaping, although the HTA found that results for e-cigarettes are promising, there is currently a lack of evidence to recommend their use as a smoking cessation aid and at present no e-cigarette product is licensed as a medicinal product in Ireland. The safety of e-cigarettes is an evolving area of research; while potentially safer than smoking, evidence on its long-term safety has yet to be established.  In the absence of additional evidence confirming the effectiveness of e-cigarettes, the HTA recommended that the HSE smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of combination NRT treatment among those for whom varenicline is contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred.  </p>  <p>  The results of the HTA are informing the development by the HSE, in conjunction with the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee, of national clinical guidelines. </p>  <p>  Current evidence-based means of quitting include behavioural support and pharmacotherapies.  The HSE provides and promotes these safe and evidence-based services, supports and aids to help people to quit.  The HSE recommends that those wishing to give up smoking uses its cessation services as the first port of call.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the emerging research on all products, so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area. </p></reply>

What may or may not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist; and </p>  <p>2. What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.</p>  <p>  On June 21, the Council of the Society approved for issuance for public consultation the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018. This public consultation commenced on 17 July and ran until 14 August and afforded any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the public consultation phase, I understand that the Council of the PSI will consider the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its next meeting scheduled on the 20th September 2018.  The results of the public consultation undertaken in this regard will be available to the Council. In circumstances where the Council approve these draft rules (with/without amendment) these will then be forwarded to me for my consideration and consent in line with requirements of Section 30 of the Act. </p>  <p>  My role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of any such Rules once submitted for my approval.  No rules have as yet been submitted to me by the PSI.</p>  <p>  I must consider any Rules presented to me from a fair and impartial perspective, without prejudice or prejudgement.  I await the receipt of the Rules and possible commencement date for my consideration from the PSI and until that time, I am unfortunately not in a position to comment any further on the matter raised. </p></reply>

Allowable deductions include income tax and, therefore, any income tax arising from rental income should be deducted; other deductions include some health expenses, levies required by law to be paid, and interest on some loans in respect of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence.</p>  <p>  Action 17 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector commits the Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government (DHPLG) to examine the treatment, under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme's financial assessment, of income from the rental of a person's principal private residence where they move into long term residential care.  My officials are working with DHPLG officials and examining a number of possible options.

However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.

The commencement of the greater part of this Act is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives (AHDs) is a matter for my Department. An AHD is a statement made by a person with capacity setting out his or her will and preferences regarding treatment decisions that may arise in the future when he or she no longer has capacity.</p>  <p>  Under section 91 of the Act, the Minister for Health is responsible for the establishment of a multidisciplinary working group to assist in the development and preparation of the Code of Practice for the AHD provisions of the Act. I established this multidisciplinary working group on 17th of October 2016 under section 91(2) of the Act. The role of the working group is to prepare a detailed series of recommendations for the Director of the Decision Support Service, in relation to codes of practice. The Director will subsequently prepare a Code(s) of Practice and will submit it to me for approval and, with my consent, the Director will then publish the Code of Practice.  </p>  <p>  The preparation of the Code of Practice will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Part 8 of the Act, pertaining to AHDs, in its entirety.</p>  <p>  My Department is also actively developing legislation to provide procedural safeguards to ensure that people in relevant facilities are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty.</p>  <p>  The Government approved draft Heads of Bill on this matter for public consultation last December. This draft legislation sets out procedural safeguards to ensure that people in relevant facilities who lack capacity are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty.  The approach taken in the draft legislation makes use of the decision-making procedures, supports and safeguards that already exist under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and also includes some additional safeguards specific to deprivation of liberty.  The proposals build on the machinery of the Decision Support Service, which is provided for under this Act.  The 51 submissions that were received as part of this public consultation are currently being analysed.</p>  <p>  An Advisory Group comprised of key stakeholders has been formed to consider the findings of the public consultation, advise on appropriate amendments to the draft Heads of Bill and ensure that the approach taken integrates effectively with existing legislation.</p>  <p>  Every effort is being made to progress the legislation as quickly as possible.  </p></reply>

These guidelines are also available on the Department&rsquo;s website at the aforementioned web address. The guidelines contain detailed information on medical cannabis, including clinical guidance on the use of medical cannabis and guidance on which cannabis products are appropriate for medical use. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that, while these guidelines will primarily underpin the functioning of the Access Programme, the Department invites all clinicians with an interest in considering use of medical cannabis, and in applying for a licence under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 to prescribe cannabis for their patient, to review this information repository.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are working on secondary legislation in the form of three Statutory Instruments, which will underpin the Access Programme. This work will be finalised once appropriate cannabis-based products, to be included in the legislation, can be sourced. </p>  <p>  Whilst medical cannabis products are not medicines, ensuring that such products meet appropriate quality standards when they are made available to the Irish market is a critical aspect of facilitating safe access to medical cannabis for patients. My officials are working intensively on this issue to ensure a supply of appropriate medical cannabis products from other EU Member States and further afield to meet the needs of patients. However, my Department has no control in relation to business decisions taken by commercial product manufacturers and has no powers to compel such companies to supply their products to the Irish market. </p>  <p>  Until these products are made available in Ireland, it will be a matter for the prescriber and their patient to source the prescribed medical cannabis-based product.</p>  <p>  It is understood that patients who have been prescribed such products under Ministerial Licence have sourced them from a pharmacy in the Netherlands. Contact details for this pharmacy are available on the relevant section of the Department's website. </p>  <p>  To date, Ministerial licences have been issued for the treatment of nine individual patients, upon receipt of valid licence applications from their clinicians.</p></reply>

The Strategy aims to improve dementia care to allow people with dementia to live well for as long as possible and have services and supports delivered as well as possible. A review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy was published in May this year and has identified what has been achieved so far and sets out further work required to further implement the Strategy. This work will feed into the estimates process for 2019 and subsequent years.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the Strategy, a National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme (NDSIP) was agreed by the Department of Health, the HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies. &euro;27.5million was committed to the Programme over a three year period across a number of initiatives, including dementia specific intensive homecare packages, an education and training programme for GPs and Primary Care Teams, and an information and awareness campaign which seeks to challenge public misconceptions about dementia and the challenges facing people living with dementia.</p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the HSE&rsquo;s National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. The project did not look at the generic services that people with dementia or their families and carers may use or the quality of the identified services.  However, it provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area. There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  In addition to these community supports, in 2014 the HSE introduced Dementia-Specific Intensive Homecare Packages (Dementia-IHCPs) to test the feasibility of providing a high level of support to people with dementia with complex needs to facilitate them to remain living at home. These were initially co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies and now fully funded by the HSE, which has committed to continue to provide approximately 120 packages at any one time. At the end of July, there were 171 active Dementia-IHCPs, while 361 people with dementia had availed of an IHCP. In addition to the IHCPs, people with dementia are also able to avail of standard home care services on the basis of need and within the resources available.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health secured &euro;6.26 million through the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans to develop a number of projects which are designed to expand public awareness of dementia and to improve care for people with dementia. Projects receiving funding include the delivery of post-diagnostic supports; a dementia diagnostic service for people with intellectual disability; a national network of memory technology resource rooms; the development of a national dementia registry; the national rollout of a Dementia Training Programme for HSE homecare staff; the development of Dementia Resource Centres; funding for a dementia community activation coordinator; and community support projects for people with dementia. </p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has developed a needs analysis framework to support local dementia service planning and development. This framework is a mechanism to help the Office direct time, energy and resources into dementia care that most appropriately meets the needs of people with dementia. It will be used to make dementia service development more responsive and consistent across the country.</p>  <p>  The level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning. </p></reply>

This is a result both of out-of-cycle smears and increased uptake generally. This has impacted turnaround times for results of smear tests. CervicalCheck has advised that, while normally a smear test result would be received within 4-6 weeks of a test, it may currently take up to 15 weeks from the time of a smear test until receipt of the results. This is a priority concern, and I am advised that every effort is being made to ensure that tests are processed as quickly as possible, having regard to the high standards required for testing. </p>  <p>  I am also advised that, in a small number of cases, certain smears may have to be retaken. This can occur where the smear is not sufficient for reading, the smear has expired for various reasons or the slide is damaged.

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia. Progress made to date and future plans, are recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year.</p>  <p>  The Strategy&rsquo;s implementation was boosted at the time of its launch through a joint programme of investment by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies. This &euro;27.5 million investment allowed for a number of key actions within the strategy to be resourced and implemented. It funded the PREPARED programme, which offers education and clinical resources for GPs and Primary Care Teams; intensive homecare packages for people with dementia; the Understand Together awareness campaign; and the establishment of the National Dementia Office, which has an important role in implementing the Strategy. The Office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia. Additional projects are being funded through &euro;6.26 million in Dormant Accounts funding secured by the Department of Health in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans.</p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area. There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has also developed a needs analysis framework to support local dementia service planning and development. This framework is a mechanism to help the Office direct time, energy and resources into dementia care that most appropriately meets the needs of people with dementia. It will be used to make dementia service development more responsive and consistent across the country. </p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites. In order to fully capture the experience of demonstrator sites and inform the future development of this service, the National Dementia Office commissioned an external evaluation of the service. The evaluation, by University College Cork, began in November 2017 and is expected to be finalised by September 2018. Initial results indicate that a majority of people with dementia are satisfied with the information, advice, support and signposting provided by dementia advisers. The service has brought normality to their lives, provided understanding about dementia and given people with dementia the confidence to ask questions. The appointment of additional dementia advisers will be considered when the results of this evaluation are available. </p>  <p>  A priority action in the National Dementia Strategy is the appointment of key workers to coordinate each patient's care and promote continuity, and ensure that the patient knows who to access for information and advice. It is proposed that the key worker will be responsible for the coordinated planning and delivery of individually tailored care plans, developed in consultation with the person, their family carers and a range of health and social care practitioners. The key worker will also provide expert knowledge and leadership in dementia. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has secured funding through the 2018 Dormant Accounts Action Plan to continue funding in 2019 for the Dementia Community Activation Coordinator post which has been co-funded through a partnership between the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the HSE during 2018. The Community Activation Coordinator is working with national organisations and key community stakeholders to support community dementia champions across Ireland. The Coordinator will seek to grow the number of champions and people within communities to take action to create sustainable dementia inclusive communities.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific requests for funding referred to by the Deputy, the level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

At my request, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is preparing a report which will make recommendations in relation to the clinical and technical issues involved.  I am informed that following policy actions in relation to mesh by health authorities in the NHS and in Northern Ireland in July 2018, as set out below, further engagements with the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Agency, the professional bodies and colleagues in other jurisdictions were needed for the purpose of finalising the report.  I am informed that the CMO&rsquo;s Report is anticipated to be completed in the coming weeks.</p><p>Pending finalisation of the report, a number of significant system actions in relation to mesh implants have already been advanced.</p><p>The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the Health Service Executive on 20 July 2018 to request that the Executive put immediate measures in place to: </p><p>1.  Pause the use of all procedures involving uro-gynaecological/transvaginal mesh implants for the management of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) or Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in HSE funded hospitals, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so. </p><p>2.  Ensure that in situations where expert clinical judgment is that there is an urgency to carry out the procedure and no suitable alternative exists, surgery should proceed only if a delay would risk harm to the patient and should be based on multidisciplinary team decision and fully informed consent.</p><p>This pause is to remain in place pending confirmation of implementation by the Health Service Executive, working in conjunction with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), of three urgent recommendations relating to:</p><p>(i) Surgical Training, </p><p>(ii) Informed Consent and </p><p>(iii) the Development of an agreed Dataset of Mesh Procedures.</p><p>The Department also wrote to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Continence Foundation of Ireland on requesting that they assist the HSE in progressing these recommendations on an urgent basis.</p><p>The HSE has published information for patients on its website concerning the pause.</p><p>It is acknowledged that there may be concerns that restricting the availability of mesh procedures, particularly SUI mesh procedures, which are widely accepted to be less invasive and more effective than non-mesh alternatives will delay access to treatment procedures for distressing symptoms. Advice received in relation to this is that uro-gynaecological mesh procedures are largely elective procedures and it is not anticipated that a postponement of weeks / months will materially affect health outcomes for the majority of women affected. Given the limited number of surgeons and units carrying out these procedures in HSE funded hospitals, it is anticipated that the Executive will be in a position to indicate to the Department that these recommendations have been implemented within a number of months.</p><p>The decision to institute a pause in vaginal mesh procedures in HSE funded hospitals followed a review by Department officials, together with representatives of the HSE and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), of the NHS England decision of Tuesday 10 July to institute a similar &lsquo;pause&rsquo; in their use. This decision in the NHS followed a recommendation by the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety (IMMDS) Review established in February 2018 by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, the Rt. Hon Jeremy Hunt MP. On Wednesday July 11, a pause was instigated by health authorities in Northern Ireland. </p><p>It has been clarified by the NHS that there is no concurrent change in the evidence base concerning these devices. The recommendations of the IMMDS to NHS England arose because of a lack of certainty or confidence that critical clinical governance measures to assure the safety of mesh procedures are demonstrably in place. The Department considers that similar concerns in relation to the visibility and consistency of such measures apply equally in the public health system here.</p><p>There is understandable public and patient anxiety about the ongoing safety of mesh devices in light of the considerable publicity that this issue has received and this has been heightened by recent developments in the NHS. It is important that this be addressed as comprehensively as possible.  A pause on the use of mesh procedures, pending confirmation by the Executive that the recommendations as set out above have been implemented, is considered proportionate and necessary to provide public assurance that these procedures are being carried out in accordance with internationally accepted good practice. </p><p>The advice of the HPRA to the Department is that it is supports a temporary restriction on all procedures involving uro-gynaecological/transvaginal mesh implants, pending the introduction of the further clinical mechanisms proposed relating to the delivery of care for patients. The regulatory status of uro-gynaecological mesh implants at a European level remains unchanged in that they are CE marked medical devices. As such, the benefit-risk profile for the devices is considered positive. Ensuring that the use of transvaginal mesh is appropriate and as safe as possible requires, not only that the device is safe and performs as intended, but also that the healthcare system has appropriate measures for patient selection, treatment and follow-up in place. </p><p>In relation to the provision of appropriate aftercare for women suffering from mesh complications, including appropriate diagnostic facilities, this has already been identified as one of two priority recommendations for immediate advancement by the Executive in the course of preparation of the CMO&rsquo;s report.  The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the HSE, and to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG), the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), and the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) on May 28 2018,  requesting that the Executive commence work on (i) the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials and (ii) clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications, in conjunction with the IOG, the RCSI and the CFI.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed that work has commenced by the National Women and Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) in the HSE to progress all of the recommendations above.  A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the NWIHP on 26 June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website.</p><p>The experiences of women concerned will be an essential element to informing the assessment of need and identifying the aftercare services required. I am informed that a Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations.</p><p>This work is ongoing and will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. It will also include an examination of the role of and requirement for specialist diagnostic services such as translabial scanning. The outcome of this work will clarify if there is a need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any shortfalls identified at national level, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.</p><p>The information provided by the HSE is that approximately 700-800 procedures are carried out annually for pelvic organ prolapse repair and similar numbers of sling procedures for stress urinary incontinence are performed. However, the HSE Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE) system does not record the numbers of these procedures that involve the implantation of a mesh device.</p><p>The HSE advice is that all patients who have experienced complications due to mesh devices are advised to contact their consultant&rsquo;s clinic in the first instance.  Each hospital group has nominated an individual to coordinate a response to this group of patients.  If patients are having trouble accessing information they can contact the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme at <i>smi.nwihp@hse.ie for help.</i></p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  </p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. </p><p>The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p><p>Nusinersen (Spinraza) is for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).  </p><p>An application for the reimbursement of Nusinersen (Spinraza) is currently being processed by the HSE.  No decision has been arrived at as yet as the statutory assessment process is still ongoing. </p><p>Two members of the Beneluxa Initiative (Belgium and the Netherlands) completed a joint negotiation for the reimbursement of Spinraza in July 2018.  This process began before Ireland joined the collaboration and Ireland was not party to these negotiations. </p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective.  However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner.  Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults.  This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service.  In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters.  The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care.  Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient.  If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal, making a clear clinical case for the patient, to the MMP.  Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: hse.ie/yourmedicines.</p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE and you will appreciate that, as Minister for Health, I cannot intervene in individual cases.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

While I cannot comment on individual cases, the Chidren's Hospital Group advises that there are cases where a child has multiple clinical complexities and medical conditions that requires consultation between parents, several doctors and other clinical team members as part of planning treatment options.  In these cases, the children&rsquo;s hospitals are in regular contact with these families.  </p>  <p>  The Children's Hospital Group has advised that suspensions are managed in line with NTPF guidelines.  Patients in the suspended category are those that are not clinically ready for surgery therefore at a point in time are not captured as part of the 4 month target.  There is a plan in OLCHC to progress a clinical case management system to categorise and manage those patients who do not need to be on a waiting list. In reviewing these patients (on the suspended waiting list) there appears to be a number of patients who will be clinically deemed as not requiring surgery in 2018. These patients will be managed via the clinical case management system in the coming weeks in order to ensure that a safe, robust system is in place to support clinical decisions and case management. </p>  <p>  The Children's Hospital advise that should any families wish to discuss their child&rsquo;s care, that they contact the hospital directly. </p></reply>

Last month, it was replaced by the provider with a relocatable cath lab, operating on the same basis as the mobile cath lab, i.e., it is managed by three diagnostic cardiologists, operates Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and carries out diagnostic cardiology procedures only.  </p>  <p>  I am eager that a cath lab capable of undertaking interventional procedures is operational in UHW in order to address waiting times at the hospital and provide a better service for the people of Waterford and the South East.  Interventional procedures can be provided in both relocatable and modular cath labs where additional facilities and staff are available.  </p>  <p>  The contractual arrangements currently in place at UHW are for the provision of a unit capable of carrying out diagnostic cardiac procedures only.  </p>  <p>  In order to comply with public procurement guidelines, the procurement of a cath lab for UHW that is capable of undertaking interventional procedures must be carried out through a new procurement process rather than through an extension of the current contract.  </p>  <p>  All options for the provision of interventional procedures will be considered, taking into account timescales for delivery, cost and the additional staff and facilities required.  The HSE has submitted its proposed new service developments for 2019 to the Department and the estimated cost of providing interventional procedures in a relocatable or modular cath lab is being considered as part of the 2019 estimates and capital planning processes.  </p>  <p>  As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac cath labs and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally will be informed by the outcome of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services, which is expected to be complete by June 2019.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the relocatable lab remains on site and the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services continues to progress.  </p></reply>

The HSE&rsquo;s 2018 National Service Plan provides for a target of some 17.094m home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people, which compares with last year&rsquo;s 16.34m hours delivered to 50,000 people (home help and home care package funded hours combined).  This is an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people. In addition, 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.  A further initiative saw 324 people being provided with home support services in the context of the adverse weather.  </p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow.  It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home support across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available.  In this context, I acknowledge that access to the service may take longer than we would like.  However, the HSE monitors the delivery of home support on an on-going basis, to ensure that activity is maximised relative to individual clients&rsquo; assessed care needs within the overall available resources for home support and having regard to demand throughout the year.  As part of the Estimates process, the Department is actively engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to funding for Older People Services in 2019, including home support services.  </p></reply>

Over &euro;27.6m has been allocated to Task Forces by the HSE and the Department of Health for community-based drugs initiatives this year.  This level of funding is consistent with the amounts provided for the last four years.  </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;250,000 in one off funding was provided in Budget 2018 to improve the organisational effectiveness of the Task Forces in implementing the national drugs strategy. Individual Task Forces can receive up to &euro;10,000 in additional funding.  Payment of this funding is currently being processed by my Department and the HSE.  </p>  <p>  I recently announced a further &euro;290,000 in one off funding for Task Forces to support and enhance services addressing drug and alcohol misuse.  This money will be allocated in quarter four of 2018.  In addition, Task Forces will be consulted by the HSE on the provision of &euro;710,000 in one off funding for priority projects and services in CHO areas.  </p>  <p>  The provision of additional funding for drug and alcohol addiction services, including Drug and Alcohol Task Forces, must be considered in the context of the estimates process for 2019.  As the estimates process is ongoing it is not possible for me to comment in advance on the outcome of this process.  </p>  <p>  I strongly believe that resources should be directed towards interventions that are most effective in reducing problem substance use.  Measuring the effectiveness of responses to the drug problem is therefore an important objective of public policy.  Towards this end, my Department will develop a performance measurement system by 2020 which will improve accountability across all sectors, including the Task Forces.  </p></reply>

A considerable number of patients presenting to the Emergency Departments are frail or acute patients that often require admission. However, acknowledging this, the number of nurses employed in Emergency Departments had increased from 1,231 at end 2015 to 1,500 in September 2018, representing an increase of 269 or 22%. While the vacancies extend to all Emergency Departments, albeit in small numbers, it should be noted a significant number of these vacancies are currently being filled through agency staff and overtime working arrangements.</p>  <p>  The HSE remains committed to filling these vacant posts on a permanent basis and have undertaken a number of national and local recruitment campaigns. In addition to this the HSE is also in the process of offering all graduate nurses and midwives contracts upon registration with NMBI, the nursing regulator. </p></reply>

In this capacity, the Department of Health is working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and its agencies including the HSE have been conducting detailed analysis on the impacts of Brexit in the area of health and intensive Brexit preparedness and contingency planning is underway. </p>  <p>  A key issue will be to ensure that there is minimum disruption to health services and that essential services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island and Ireland-UK basis. Priorities include ensuring continuity in the supply of medicines and medical devices, ensuring access to services, manpower in our health services, continuation of existing cross border health co-operation and public health arrangements. </p>  <p>  On regulatory issues, it is clear that having a single set of rules across the European Union is enormously helpful &ndash; to protect human health, to ensure consumer protection and to provide a level playing field for industry. Ensuring continuity in the supplies following the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU is a priority. The issue of customs is of relevance as it relates to additional food safety controls and medicines. The implications of Brexit for networks and organisations such as the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed are also under consideration.</p>  <p>  Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome was identified as an early priority and is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate economic, regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern.</p>  <p>  This work has provided baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations. This is enabling the modelling of potential responses under different scenarios, such as one where a withdrawal agreement, including a transitional arrangement, is concluded and where a Free Trade Agreement is the basis for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. </p>  <p>  In line with this approach, the Government has already approved a number of key Brexit preparedness measures focused on East-West trade and has mandated the presentation to Government before the end of September of detailed and costed proposals on the staffing, IT, infrastructural and operational requirements for the implementation at ports and airports of the necessary customs controls and sanitary and phytosanitary checks required as a result of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. In total 51 reports analysing the effects of Brexit across a broad range of sectors and in some cases setting out responses have been published to date by Government Departments. All these reports are available on a dedicated Brexit webpage at: dfat.ie/brexit. </p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.  </p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. </p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  Nusinersen (Spinraza) is for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).  </p>  <p>  An application for the reimbursement of Nusinersen (Spinraza) is currently being processed by the HSE.

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. </p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged by his or her GP, that patient should report the matter to their local HSE Health Office.</p>  <p>  The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides a range of treatments to medical card holders from contracted dental practitioners.  This includes free dental examinations every calendar year, which can confirm if a patient is dentally fit to undergo a medical procedure.  Records kept by dentists must be available when requested by patients and given to them within a reasonable period of time.  Services which are not part of the DTSS contract may be charged at the dentist&rsquo;s discretion.  A new National Oral Health Policy is currently being developed which is considering alternatives to the current "fee per item" system provided within the DTSS.  The Policy is due to be published later this year.</p></reply>

Following  consideration of the matter, it was decided to  withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time.  A new Transport Support Payment Scheme remains a priority and we intend to revert to Government with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between ourselves, in due course.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance.  Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and ongoing work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

Based on the 2017 National Forest Inventory, Ireland&rsquo;s forests have removed an average of 3.8 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalents per year from the atmosphere over the period 2007 to 2016.  This carbon resource has proven to be of pivotal significance in Ireland achieving its Kyoto target under the first commitment period of 2008-2012.</p>  <p>  Removals of greenhouse gases by forests in Ireland cannot contribute to emission reduction targets in the current climate mitigation period (2014 -2020).  However, under the now agreed Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) this is no longer the case and Ireland&rsquo;s existing forest resource is set to play an important part in helping Ireland meet its emission targets in the next climate mitigation period (2021&ndash;2030).  Flexibilities introduced as part of the ESR agreement mean that Ireland&rsquo;s forests will be able to account for up to 2.2 million tonnes of carbon each year against our national non-ETS targets up to 2030.  In addition, wood harvested from forests is itself a long term, renewable carbon pool and can produce sustainable materials that can substitute emission-dense non-renewable materials and fuels.</p></reply>

Commission Implementing Regulation 262/2015 (CR 262/2015), which came into effect on 1 January 2016, lays down the rules governing the identification of equidae.  This legislation was transposed into national legislation in Ireland via the European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations (S.I. 62 of 2016) (as amended).</p>  <p>  Article 12(1) of CR 262/2015 provides that all equine animals must be identified with a passport no later than 12 months from the date of birth of the animal, and in any event, before moving permanently from the holding of origin.  The passport must generally accompany the equine on movement.</p>  <p>  Equines for which passports were issued with effect from 1st July 2009 must be implanted with a microchip by a veterinary practitioner and the number of that microchip must be recorded in the passport of the animal and on my Department's central equine database, thereby establishing a link between the animal and its identification document.  However, equines identified with a passport prior to that date are not required to be implanted with a microchip.  Accordingly, the absence of a microchip does not necessarily mean that an equine is not identified properly.</p>  <p>  Equine passports are issued by Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs) approved by my Department.  Information available from these organisations suggest that high rates of compliance with the identification rules are being achieved.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of equine identification legislation is primarily undertaken by authorised officers in my Department and across the various Local Authorities, who liaise with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and officers of the Revenue Commissioners Officials, as required.  Authorised officers from my Department engage in checks at sales venues including marts and fairs, as well as at horse slaughter plants and at export points including ports and airports.  These compliance checks are ongoing and will continue to be undertaken.</p>  <p>  The presence of a microchip in an equine cannot be established visually.  When checking for the presence of a microchip in an equine, it is necessary to physically handle and scan the animal.  From a health and safety perspective, this action should only be undertaken by personnel who are competent in the handling of equines.  In that regard, where a member of  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na requires an equine to be scanned, s/he should liaise with veterinary staff in the relevant Regional Veterinary Offices (RVO) of my Department who will assist in the scanning of the equine.  All of the RVOs have sufficient supplies of scanners.</p></reply>

The basic principles of animal welfare, popularly referred to as the &ldquo;five freedoms&rdquo; are reflected in the detailed provisions of the Act.   In particular, section 11 requires a person who has an animal in his or her possession or under his or her control to take all measures necessary to safeguard the welfare of the animal.  Section 12 contains an explicit obligation not to cause unnecessary suffering to any animal and enjoins a person not to be negligent or reckless regarding the welfare of an animal.  Section 13 of the Act obliges a person having an animal in his or her possession or under his or her control to provide the animal with suitable food and water to satisfy its needs.</p>  <p>   An investigation into suspected abuse will invariably involve a visit to the land or premises concerned, a veterinary assessment of animals and the conditions in which they are kept and, where appropriate, gathering physical or documentary evidence; the person having possession or control of the animal or animals concerned will normally be interviewed. Where non-compliance or breaches of the Act are encountered, a range of measures can be used by an authorised officer depending on the severity and scale of the non-compliance. Minor non compliances may be addressed by means of advice or guidance or reference to codes of practice. For more serious issues, formal notices requiring specific corrective actions and/or fixed penalty notices may be issued. In the most serious cases, authorised officers will prepare files for prosecution, and some cases will require the seizure of animals on welfare grounds.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to  support the animal welfare sector directly with a scheme of ex-gratia payments.  In December 2017, 111 animal welfare organisations received funding of &euro;2.56m which represents the largest annual amount allocated to date. A significant number of these organisations are involved in the care of unwanted horses and assist in important re-homing initiatives. In addition funding  is provided  to local authorities for the development of education and training programmes including new structures to provide shelter for the urban horse population with the aim of reducing the number of straying animals and encouraging young people in the care and welfare of horses.</p></reply>

In the Terms and Conditions, the requirements in relation to entitlement usage are outlined. In the  2018 BPS Terms &amp;amp; Conditions booklet, the requirements relating to entitlement usage are detailed on pages 21 and 22.  Under these requirements, all entitlements allocated are subject to a two-year usage rule.  In effect should a farmer have unused entitlements for two consecutive years, the entitlements will be reverted to the National Reserve in the second year of non-usage.  It states specifically on page 22 - <i>&quot;To avoid the loss of entitlements ... the farmer should ensure he/she has sufficient land in 2018 to utilise all entitlements&quot;.</i></p><p>When an applicant submits his/her BPS application he/she confirms that he/she is aware of the conditions attaching to the Scheme for which the application is made (as set out in the Terms and Conditions) and agree to comply fully with these requirements.  </p><p>The person named had 32.22 entitlements and under the 2017 BPS application, which was submitted online on 11 May 2017. He declared 14.94 hectares.  Under the 2018 BPS application, the person named again still only claimed 14.94 hectares.  This means that a portion of his entitlements were reverted in 2018 to the National Reserve due to non-usage.  </p><p>A farmer&rsquo;s usage position is available for them to view at any time on the online system where it clearly states the number of available entitlements and the number which have been used in each year. </p><p>It should be noted also, that all farmers have the opportunity, under the BPS, to make amendments to their applications up to a certain date. Under the 2018 BPS, amendments were permitted, including the addition of land parcels up to 31 May 2018 without penalty and up to 9 June 2018 with a penalty. This is also highlighted in the Terms and Conditions booklet that issued to the farmers.  It is, however, not possible to add land to a BPS application after that date. </p></reply>

Inhalation of PM can increase respiratory morbidity (including exacerbation of existing conditions such as asthma) as well as contributing to cardiovascular disease.</p><p>In recognition of the fact that air pollution has greater impact on health at lower levels than was previously understood, I am preparing to launch Ireland&rsquo;s first ever National Clean Air Strategy, which will provide the strategic policy framework to identify and promote the required integrated measures across Government to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while also delivering on wider social and economic objectives.  A number of measures to address emissions from transport will be set out in the strategy, including a review of financial measures that may incentivise particular consumer choices in transport.  </p><p>In addition, a key part of the strategy will be the expansion of our monitoring and data gathering capacity, to better inform policy choices.  The new national Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP) will double the number of ambient air quality monitoring stations in Ireland by 2022 and enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public.  Further details on the timeframes for the expansion of the network will be released as they become available. I fully endorse this important initiative, and have committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme. Testing of particular areas, such as 'set-down' areas around schools, is not currently planned but I would fully support local initiatives that Local Authorities or school authorities may begin in this regard; for example in the context of the Green Schools programme or the Clean Air Award under the Tidy Towns programme. </p><p>Finally, I am a strong proponent of Electric Vehicles (EVs). 2018 has seen a marked step change in the take-up of EVs in Ireland.  So far this year, EV sales have already surpassed the total number of EVs sold in 2017 and I think this trend will only continue as more people become aware of the environmental and broader benefits driving an EV brings.Further information on  the supports available and on the benefits and realities of driving an EV are available on the website <i>www.DrivingElectric.ie</i>which is a one-stop shop providing information on EVs.</p></reply>

Drilling commenced on 13 July 2017 and the well was plugged on 19 September 2017. The well did not result in a find of oil or gas. Operatorship of the Licence subsequently transferred to Total E&amp;amp;P Ireland BV.</p><p>Providence Resources Plc currently operates a single licence in the Porcupine Basin, Frontier Exploration Licence 6/14. The term of the Licence is from 1 April 2014 to 31 March 2029.</p><p>Providence Resources Plc holds a minority interest in, but does not operate, Licensing Option 16/27 and Frontier Exploration Licences 2/14, 2/04, 3/04, 4/08, all located in the Porcupine Basin.</p><p>Petroleum exploration authorisations, including Licensing Options and Exploration Licences, enable the holder to explore for oil and gas generally and are not specific to oil or gas.</p><p>Under Section 57 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 half yearly reports detailing all petroleum authorisations granted during the period of the report are required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. These reports are also made available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The last such report published was in respect of the six-month period ending 30 June 2018.</p></reply>

This network includes circa 80 fast chargers, mainly on national routes. </p><p>A key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involves examining how best to support the development of the public charging network. The first phase of the Taskforce's work, which focuses on electric vehicles, is nearing completion and will lead to an expanded range of supports for the provision of effective and efficient electric vehicle charging.</p><p>In July I announced the first Call for Applications for the Climate Action Fund which is one of the four funds established under the <i>National Development Plan 2018-2027 </i>as part of <i>Project Ireland 2040</i>. The Climate Action Fund will provide at least &euro;500 million to support initiatives that contribute to the achievement of Ireland's climate and energy targets over the next decade.  The first Call for Applications focuses on funding larger scale projects that are scheduled to commence development in 2019 or 2020.  Local infrastructure projects including the provision of electric vehicle charging networks will be eligible to apply.  Further information can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Funding for public charging in local communities can also be accessed through the Better Energy Communities Scheme.  The scheme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, supports community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of homes, businesses and community facilities in a local area.</p><p>Although I cannot provide a timeline for the provision of additional charger installations at this point, I expect the supports that are in place, and further proposals that I intend to bring forward later this year, will increase the availability of publically accessible electric vehicle charging.</p></reply>

SEAI is administering the grant on behalf of my Department.  Home heating is a significant investment for most households, especially if changing from familiar fuels and systems, and is not a decision usually hurried.  Once a household has  looked at the options, the supports available for heat pumps and decided to invest and to apply for a grant they go through the following steps:</p><p>- Obtain quotes</p><p>- Submit an application to the SEAI</p><p>- Take up to 6 months to complete the works</p><p>- Return declaration of works to SEAI</p><p>So, there is a necessary lag time between applying for a grant and having works carried out.  To date SEAI has received 160 applications from homeowners for the installation of a heat pump, which are currently being processed.  While all homeowners are eligible for this grant, to protect homeowners from installing heating systems in homes that are not well insulated (resulting in  heat loss and higher energy bills), the home must meet a certain level of energy efficiency before SEAI can approve the application. </p><p>Grants for all types of wall insulation and attic insulation are also available from SEAI and I increased the amount of grant support offered for these energy efficiency measures earlier this year.  </p><p>Heat pumps are also grant funded under other energy efficiency schemes administered by SEAI.

I am acutely conscious of the value placed by communities in both rural and urban areas on services provided by post offices and I am fully committed to ensuring that a sustainable post office network is available to all our citizens for the medium and for the long term.  While I completely accept that the recent announcement of closures will have an impact on the communities served, it is important to be put the announcement of these closures into context.  </p>  <p>  It is widely accepted that the post office network has been facing many challenges for some years now with a continuing decline in transaction numbers primarily driven by the move to online payments and online banking, as well as eSubstitution.  Less than 2 years ago, I was presented with a future for An Post and the post office network that was uncertain and extremely bleak.  The potential for a complete shutdown of postal services with the loss of thousands of jobs was undeniable.  Immediate action was needed and since then there has been significant work undertaken to restructure the company. </p>  <p>  As part of this process An Post announced, in April this year, a renewed vision for the post office network which centres on the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network.  The announcement was supported by an agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) executive following months of intensive negotiations, and was subsequently endorsed by 80% of IPU members.  In its negotiations with An Post, Postmasters sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business.  An Post advises that where a post office closes, 70% of the business transfers to a neighbouring office.  The reality is that by facilitating those that wish to exit the business, neighbouring offices are further supported thereby ensuring a more sustainable network for the future. </p>  <p>  The agreement represents a necessary first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates by providing a service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas.</p>  <p>  An Post has done extensive work combining business and demographic data with local knowledge to produce a network plan which actively supports the future of rural Ireland.  An Post is committed to ensuring a vibrant network for all its customers through investment and the expansion of e-commerce, financial and government services to drive usage and relevancy of the post office in today&rsquo;s changing environment.</p>  <p>  While Government policy is to offer Government services online, there will always be a segment of the population that is not comfortable or proficient accessing online tools or services.  The post office network is the obvious choice as the &ldquo;offline gateway&rdquo; for citizens with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens.  Government funding of &euro;80,000 has been allocated to roll out a pilot scheme for Digital Assist which will see 10 post offices equipped to help citizens with online Government interactions.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I have secured Government approval to explore how further services might be made available to our &ldquo;offline citizens&rdquo;.  This would be delivered via a centralised procurement framework.  A Working Group comprising representatives across Government Departments will be established to consider this issue and will report back to Government by the end of year. </p></reply>

SEAI estimates that a level of 30.1% was achieved in 2017.  </p>  <p>  The increased level of renewable electricity has primarily been driven by the REFIT support schemes.  Although the REFIT support schemes have closed for new applications, projects that have been approved continue to be developed and will further contribute to meeting our 2020 renewable electricity target. </p>  <p>  In July, I secured Government approval for a new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme.  This scheme, which is subject to State Aid approval, will support additional growth in renewable electricity. </p>  <p>  As part of the recently agreed recast of the Renewable Energy Directive, an EU renewable energy target of 32% for 2030 was set.  Ireland's contribution to this target, including the level of renewable electricity in 2030, will be set out in our National Energy and Climate Plan.  The first draft of this plan is due to be developed by the end of 2018 and a final plan by the end of 2019. </p>  <p>  Increasing the level of renewable electricity also makes an important contribution to decarbonising the transport sector.  Greater levels of renewable electricity leads to a higher overall reduction in emissions from electric vehicles.  It is therefore critically important that we continue to grow the share of renewables in the electricity sector alongside the growth of electric vehicle use.  </p></reply>

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to roll out services and make specific investments in particular locations.  The ComReg consumer helpline is accessible at <i>consumerline@comreg.ie</i>and I would urge consumers who feel they have not received an appropriate response from service providers to make contact with the Regulator.  Notwithstanding ComReg's independence, I recognise the frustration felt by Irish consumers where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Accordingly, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  The Taskforce worked with key stakeholders to produce a report in December 2016, available on my Department&rsquo;s website, which contained 40 actions to alleviate some of the deficits.  The Implementation Group I co-chair with Minister Kyne is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.  This includes ComReg, which attends as both an action owner, and in an observer capacity in its role as the independent Regulator. </p><p>Minister Kyne and I published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the actions identified by the Taskforce.  Of the 40 actions, 29 have been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme.  Following close engagement with stakeholders at the National Stakeholder Forum, an additional 23 new measures have been identified for delivery in 2018, which will lead to improvements for consumers across Ireland. </p><p>In terms of addressing mobile coverage blackspots, various initiatives are under way:</p><p>- My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development have worked to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage. </p><p>- Both Departments also worked with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots.  This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis.  This exercise is ongoing, and has been included in the 2018 Taskforce Work Programme. </p><p>- A focus group was established to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority.  The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018.  It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots.  It will also inform future policy in my Department with regards to priorities for mobile phone services.</p><p>- A working group has been established with the remit of investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure. </p><p>- ComReg is delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the services available to them.</p><p>- Following a consultation process ComReg has developed a licensing scheme which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p><p>All of these initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p><p>In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for the introduction of 5G, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage.  Mobile operators&rsquo; commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction.  At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.</p></reply>

The output from wind turbines is intermittent, and cannot be fully relied upon from a system security viewpoint.  </p><p>In general terms, an excess of about 10-15% of installed generation over peak demand would allow the adequacy standard to be met, allowing for scheduled and forced outages of generation and transmission constraints.  Ireland currently has a surplus of generation.</p><p>In respect of the highest demand for electricity recorded in the past five years, EirGrid has advised that this was 4917MW.  Fluctuations in demand will be influenced by new customers connecting on to the grid, which includes demographic growth and industry demand.</p><p>Further details in relation to generation capacity can be found in EirGrid&rsquo;s Generation Capacity Statement which is published on an annual basis and can be found on EirGrid&rsquo;s website <i>www.eirgridgroup.com</i>.</p><p>Live and historical electricity demand figures can be observed on EirGrid&rsquo;s SmartGrid dashboard, available at <i></i>.</p><p>Electricity demand in Ireland has begun to grow once more following a sharp decline due to the economic downturn in 2008.  Electricity demand growth has many contributing factors, including population growth and economic growth with exceptional demand arising from time to time due to the effects of weather.  To consider Ireland's future energy needs, EirGrid is currently working through an assessment of a number of future energy scenarios under a project entitled Tomorrow's Energy Scenarios, considering a large number of variables including population and economic activity, the electrification of heating and transport, the roll-out of smart meters, and the increase in demand side management in the residential and commercial sectors.

One of the key requirements identified in the 2015 Energy White Paper is the need for appropriate energy infrastructure, including energy networks and interconnection with other countries&rsquo; energy systems.  Ireland has two interconnectors currently in place &ndash; a North-South interconnector limited to 300 MW capacity , linking the electricity systems of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the 500 MW East-West Interconnector connecting Ireland and Wales.  A second North-South interconnector, at 1500MW capacity, is currently planned to further support the All-Island Single Electricity Market.  Northern Ireland is also connected to Scotland via the 500 MW Moyle Interconnector.</p><p>Factual data in relation to the exchange of electricity &ndash; the import and export of power - is most readily viewed using the EirGrid smart grid dashboard available at this website <i></i>.</p><p>Two other electricity interconnector projects are currently proposed.  The 700 MW Celtic Interconnector proposes to link Ireland and France and the 500 MW Greenlink interconnector proposes to link Ireland and Wales. </p><p>In the aftermath of Brexit, it is anticipated that the efficient trading on cross-border subsea interconnectors will continue, although this is subject to close monitoring by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and the relevant system operators in light of developing negotiations at European level.  The development of further interconnection to the Continent will enhance our integration in the EU electricity market.  For example, if the Celtic Interconnector is constructed it will provide a clear diversification of our connectivity and provide additional security of supply.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-18a.1672.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018091800077#WRZ04400"><p>The 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development sets out an ambitious long-term commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland by at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and, in parallel, to pursue an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.  </p><p>Under the Paris Agreement, the EU has committed, on behalf of its Member States, to a reduction of at least 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, to be achieved by reductions in the Emission Trading System (ETS) sector of 43% and in the non-ETS sector of 30%.  The EU Effort Sharing Regulation, which entered into force on 9 July 2018, sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030.  Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of non-ETS emissions by 2030, with a starting point of May 2019, based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018. </p><p>Official inventories of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are prepared annually by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The most recent data, for the year 2016, are available on the EPA's website at: <i>www.epa.ie/pubs/reports/air/airemissions/ghgemissions2016/#d.en.63244</i>. </p><p>According to this data, the breakdown of emissions by sector in 2016 is as follows: <table><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Mt CO2eq.</th><th>% of total 2016 emissions</th></tr><tr><td>Agriculture</td><td>19.85</td><td>32.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Industries</td><td>12.56 </td><td>20.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Transport</td><td>12.29</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Residential</td><td>6.05</td><td>9.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing Combustion</td><td>4.55</td><td>7.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Industrial Processes</td><td>2.15 </td><td>3.5%</td></tr><tr><td>F-Gases</td><td>1.27</td><td>2.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial Services</td><td>0.99</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Waste</td><td>0.96</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Public Services</td><td>0.87</td><td>1.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Total ETS</td><td>17.73</td><td>29%</td></tr><tr><td>Total Non-ETS</td><td>43.81</td><td>71%</td></tr></table></p><p>The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020.  These targets concern emissions from most sectors not included in the EU ETS, such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  For 2030, the recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030.  Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction on 2005 levels of emissions by 2030.</p><p>The latest EPA report on greenhouse gas emissions projections, published in May 2018, indicates that Ireland complied with its annual emissions reduction targets limits in the period 2013 to 2015, but exceeded its annual binding target for the first time in 2016.  The report indicates that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020, in the context of a target that emissions should be 20% below their 2005 levels.  While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, with increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular.</p><p>The projected shortfall to our target is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU-wide cost-effective basis.  With this in mind it is crucial that the focus of our efforts must now be to ensure that we, at the absolute very least, meet our 2030 target. </p><p>As a means to addressing Ireland&rsquo;s emissions reduction challenge, I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan in July 2017.  It has established the framework for the development and implementation of medium-to-long-term policy options so as to achieve progressive emissions reductions in each of its four key sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use). </p><p>It is important to note that the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as ongoing analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  This continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy.  Such a process will be critical towards managing to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from economic activity. </p><p>Building on these strategies, the publication in February of the National Development Plan, reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society.  Almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society.  In addition, the National Development Plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.  This means that well over &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on climate mitigation and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030, as well as realising opportunities for sustainable economic growth. </p><p>To reflect the significant policy developments since the National Mitigation Plan, in particular with the publication of the National Development Plan, I published an update on climate mitigation policy -<i>Investing in the Transition to a Low-Carbon and Climate-Resilient Society 2018-2027</i>, which coincided with the <i>Empowering Communities for Climate Action </i>event on 20 June and is available to download on the DCCAE website. </p><p>In terms of expenditure, both the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan explicitly recognise that reliance solely on Exchequer expenditure schemes is neither affordable nor adequate to the scale of the challenge to be addressed, and climate mitigation action will require a targeted balance between Exchequer-supported expenditure, taxation measures, regulation and behavioural change.  In certain cases, taxation policy may have a stronger role to play in changing individual or business behaviour and investment decisions, including harnessing non-Exchequer finance. </p></reply>

In order to minimise the costs of the scheme to consumers, all renewable technologies will be subject to a viability gap look back analysis prior to each auction to identify which RES-E technologies can participate in each auction round.</p>  <p>  Regarding future projections for waste to energy in the generation mix, EirGrid's recent Tomorrow's Energy Scenarios 2017 publication estimates installed capacity for waste to energy generation to range from 80 to 100 MW by 2030, based on the assumption that waste to energy plants source half of their waste from renewable sources.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-18a.1678.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018091800077#WRZ05000"><p>The Energy White Paper presents a long-term strategic vision that is intended to guide the direction of Irish energy policy from now until 2030.  At its heart is a commitment to transform Ireland into a low carbon society and economy by 2050 and envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the energy system by 80-95% relative to 1990 levels by 2050.  The White Paper identifies the importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050 but also recognises that some fossil fuels will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period.  Furthermore, the National Mitigation Plan 2017 restates the Government's commitment to move from a fossil fuel based electricity system to a low carbon power system.  </p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  Overall, provisional SEAI analysis shows that 10.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources with renewable electricity generation accounting for 30.1% of electricity demand in the same period.  Given Ireland's baseline starting point  in the reference year of 2005, when Ireland was in the bottom quartile of renewable energy in Europe, Ireland has made significant progress and is expected to achieve over 80% of its renewable energy target by 2020.  The SEAI has also estimated that the contribution of renewables avoided &euro;276 million of fossil fuel imports in 2017.</p>  <p>  Ireland aims to increase renewable energy in transport by increasing the use of sustainable biofuels and by the increased deployment of Electric Vehicles (EV).  An EV Grant Scheme, administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), is in place to provide grant aid of up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new full battery EV or Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).  A new grant to support the installation of home charger points for buyers of new and second-hand EVs is in place since January 2018.  Other significant initiatives to advance Ireland's level of renewable energy include the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme and the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat.</p>  <p>  In June of this year the EU agreed an EU-wide binding renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030 and Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this ambition will be informed by the development of Ireland&rsquo;s first integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), a draft of which will be submitted to the Commission in December. </p>  <p>  The agriculture sector has a key role to play in helping Ireland meet its renewable energy targets.  Bioenergy will be an important part in the renewable energy mix for Ireland and thus displacing fossil fuel usage.  The sector is a key supplier of bioenergy feedstock including forest thinnings and animal by-products such as residues from the meat processing industry, slurries and other agricultural by-products.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) currently offers funding under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme for planting fast growing species.  In addition, DAFM provides supports for farmers wishing to avail of Renewable Heat technologies in the form of supports for biomass boilers and air-source heat pumps.  Grant aid is also available for solar panels used for electricity production (photovoltaic) and water heating.  Energy efficient grants for the dairy sector are also being provided through the SEAI.</p>  <p>  In addition Bord Bia operates Origin Green, Ireland&rsquo;s national sustainability programme for the food and drink sector.  The Programme sets out meaningful and measurable sustainability goals which help the sector reduce their environmental impact and achieve efficiencies in the daily running of their businesses.  Complimentary programmes like these delivered across a number of Government Departments are crucial in delivering our climate and energy ambitions as laid out in the National Development Plan and Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

My Department is currently drawing together data and information from many sources, which will inform its work.  As the Deputy is aware, given the complexity and various actors involved in Public Transport, this is rightly a very involved and detailed process, which will take time.  All elements of public transport are being considered in the review, including public transport in rural communities.</p>  <p>  As a key part of this policy review process, I decided to host a Round Table Discussion on Public Transport Policy.  I envisaged engagement with key stakeholders involved with the provision of Public Transport infrastructure and services.  Indeed, I had made advanced arrangements to host this in 2017, however I was clear that it could not go ahead against the backdrop of industrial unrest which was present at the time.  A window only became available in May of this year to host a successful event. </p>  <p>  The event included a broad &ndash; though, by no means, exhaustive &ndash; range of organisations and individuals who are closely connected with the public transport sector.  These stakeholders included: passenger and consumer interests; providers of bus, rail and taxi services; providers of transport infrastructure; trades unions with members working in public transport; those who share road-space with public transport; environmental interests; local authorities; regulators; legislators; policy-makers; and analysts and academics who focus on public transport. </p>  <p>  The discussions, papers and presentations from that Round Table Discussion will now inform a public consultation that is expected to take place over the coming months.  This consultation will further inform the ongoing review.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, I will draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the NTA&rsquo;s &lsquo;Local Link Rural Transport Programme Strategic Plan 2018 to 2022&rsquo; which was published in March of this year.  The Strategic Plan outlines key objectives and actions across 9 priority areas for the Rural Transport Programme over the next 5 years.  I see it as the road map for strengthening and developing the RTP over the coming years.  Work on delivering the actions outlined in this plan is already under way. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, I should note that the National Transport Authority (NTA) and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann report on the Rail Review was published in 2016.  Since then, the NTA has held a public consultation on the Review.  Over 300 submissions were received in response to that consultation process.  A report of those submissions has been submitted to my Department by the NTA and I intend to bring the report to Government for consideration.</p></reply>

Documentation in this regard was received from SDCC in July 2016. Following examination by my Department's technical adviser and my officials, SDCC was given approval in October 2016 to appoint the recommended design team and proceed to the design brief. In April 2017, the detailed drawings were received by my Department and referred to my Department's technical advisor for consideration. Following clarification of some technical queries, my Department issued approval to the technical design element of the Preliminary Report on the 5th July 2017. This approval allowed the Council to have the detailed contract documents prepared and therefore allowed SDCC to proceed to the Part 8 planning process. </p>  <p>  I have recently been informed that the contract documents were finalised by SDCC in August and advertised for tender on 9 August, with a closing date of 24 September.

This includes matters relating to aviation.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the work on contingency planning, there are ongoing consultations and meetings between my officials, other Government Departments and agencies, and other public and private key stakeholders in order to continue to plan for and mitigate the risks associated with Brexit. </p>  <p>  It is also important that the aviation industry takes steps to prepare for the possibility of a disorderly Brexit and that industry stakeholders undertake contingency planning to minimise the impact of Brexit on their operations. Stakeholders should refer to the European Commission&rsquo;s published Notices to Stakeholders in the field of air transport, aviation safety and aviation security. </p>  <p>  The full implications of Brexit for air transport will only become clear once the negotiations have been completed and the arrangements for the future relationship between the EU and the UK have been decided.</p></reply>

It is not possible to extract emissions specifically pertaining to Dublin Bus fleets from this figure; it is, however, clear that it represents a very limited proportion of total transport carbon emissions.</p><p>Nevertheless, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from PSO fleets remains a priority for my Department.  As the Deputy is aware, the <i>National Development Plan</i>has committed us to no longer buy diesel-only buses for the urban public bus fleet from July 2019, including, of course, the Dublin Bus fleet, and work is already underway on preparing for implementation of this transition. Together with the National Transport Authority (NTA) and key urban transport operators (Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann), my Department has begun planning an up-to-date and comprehensive set of bus trials to commence this year, with the objective of helping to further inform purchasing decisions for new buses over the coming years. </p><p>Analysis of the suitability of different fuelling options for urban bus fleets is a complex issue and must consider a range of diverse factors. The data derived from the trials will build upon and complement information from trials and demonstrations of lower-emitting buses undertaken in other jurisdictions across Europe and further afield, providing us with a better picture of how these technologies operate in the Irish context. This will allow us to ensure the continued provision of efficient and cost-effective public transport services and support modal shift in an increasingly sustainable way.</p><p>It should also be noted that the oldest and most polluting buses (Euro III- and Euro IV-classes) in the PSO fleets have been incrementally replaced with cleaner and greener Euro VI-class buses as part of the ongoing fleet renewal programme. Those older vehicles still remaining in the fleet will naturally be the first to be replaced as we transition towards lower-emitting alternative fuels and technologies with resulting reductions of both air quality pollutants and CO2 emissions.</p></reply>

It involves intensive work across legislative, ICT, administrative, governance and communications areas, and I am glad to report that positive progress is being made across all of these areas.</p><p>The legislation establishing the new Affordable Childcare Scheme, the <i>Childcare Support Act 2018</i>, was signed by the President on Monday, 2nd July.  The Act will be underpinned by detailed secondary legislation and formal policy guidelines.  Work is currently ongoing on both of these and also on the development of regulations to provide, for the first time, for the registration of school-age childcare services by the Tusla Early Years Inspectorate.  These latter regulations will be introduced in advance of the Affordable Childcare Scheme to allow school-age childcare services to register and thereby participate in the scheme from its inception.</p><p>Following a successful open tender procurement process, the ICT system to underpin the scheme is under development.  The launch of the scheme is dependent on this ICT system.  As such, now that an ICT contractor is in place, my officials are finalising a detailed project plan and I will shortly confirm and communicate a planned start date for the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p><p>With regard to the timeline of Q4 2017 set out in the Action Plan for Rural Development, I would note that, in Q3 2017, I introduced a range of interim measures designed to fast-track many of the benefits of the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  These involved an increase of up to 50% in current targeted childcare subsidy rates and a new universal subsidy for all children aged between 6 months and 3 years who are in a Tusla-registered setting.  To date, these measures have seen very good take-up rates and 84,000 children have benefitted. The measures will continue to be available over 2018 and 2019. </p></reply>

This measure enhances the previous provision, and increases the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a current average of 61 weeks, to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years). This further expansion delivers on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers. </p>  <p>  The practical provision of a second year of ECCE required either an increase in the upper age limit for ECCE, or a reduction in the lower age limit. The latter was chosen and is consistent with the law in this country with regard to school starting age and the associated policy of the Department of Education and Skills. This minimum age was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years care and education in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios. The upper age limit will remain the same (i.e. a child is not eligible if they reach the age of 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year).</p>  <p>  This new measure addresses the previous situation with three entry points (September, January and April) which gave rise to a significant fluctuation in the number of free preschool weeks a child could avail of (between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child). A single entry point will ensure a programme that is equitable in terms of entitlement for all children and helps streamline the administration process, making it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year and making it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children. </p>  <p>  As with any large scheme at national level, clear rules are required to ensure transparency and objectivity in administration. It is a feature of administrative schemes that where cut off points relate to age and birth dates, the age parameters may not suit some applicants. In this regard it should be noted that parents have the discretion to decide how much of ECCE to avail of for their child. A decision may be made to utilise only one year of the programme for various reasons.  For example, some parents of children born in the first quarter of the year, may prefer for their child to start school at 4 years of age rather than 5. These parents may therefore opt for 1 year of ECCE only. </p>  <p>  I accept that the use of age limits in a scheme such as this creates a situation whereby a child can fall just outside the age range. My Department has no immediate plans to revise the ECCE lower age limit beyond the changes already introduced in September 2018. A consideration of any future change would need to have regard to a wide range of issues as to what is in the best interests of all of the children participating in the scheme.</p></reply>

While some Local Authorities, such as Clare and Limerick, already have Digital Strategies in place, these Authorities were given the opportunity to have their strategies reviewed using the Digital Readiness Assessment tool.</p>  <p>  Work is also now progressing on preparing a suite of guidelines that will assist Local Authorities to produce comprehensive, appropriate and effective Digital Strategies. Workshops and other supports are being provided to Local Authorities as they research and prepare their strategies, which are anticipated to be completed by the end of the year.</p></reply>

The Department makes approximately 80 million social welfare payments per annum of which nearly 42% are by cash via the post office network.</p>  <p>  These cash payments are governed by the Department&rsquo;s Cash Services Contract with An Post which was signed in December 2013 and came into effect in January 2014.  This agreement allows me, as Minister, to extend the term of the contract on an annual basis up to the end of 2019. Earlier this year I renewed this contract for another year to provide pensions, Child Benefit and other social welfare payments in cash at Post Offices.  Last year&rsquo;s contract amounted to &euro;51 million for 33.6 million payments, and the value of the 2018 contract is expected to match that.</p>  <p>  The Department is required by law to go to public tender for the provision of cash services from 1 January 2020.  The award of public sector contracts with a significant financial value is subject to various EU Directives.  Public procurement rules ensure that the taxpayer receives value for money and ensures that all potential suppliers are given the opportunity to put forward the most efficient, effective and competitive solutions for consideration and evaluation.</p>  <p>  As far as is possible, the Department remains committed to giving social welfare recipients a choice of payment method.  Its consistent position has been that it will respect customer choice as appropriate and make payments in line with customer preference where choice is available.</p></reply>

The only limitation to retaining an OFP payment is an upper earnings threshold of &euro;425.  If earnings are below this threshold, the OFP recipient can work whatever number of hours suits the family circumstances, and the appropriate rate of OFP, relative to the earnings received, will be paid.</p>  <p>  Working Family Payment (WFP) may also be payable, where a minimum of 19 hours per week is worked.  Again, there is no upper limit on the hours worked, but an earnings threshold applies (this varies depending on the number of children in the household).  It is clear, therefore, that policy is aimed at supporting and encouraging work where this is a viable option for lone parents.</p>  <p>  Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting 27,400 recipients at a cost of &euro;180 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or income increase.  Income from employment and Working Family Payment (WFP) in excess of the standard Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) weekly rate of payment attracts an additional income disregard and the income is assessed as follows; the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 can be disregarded for means assessment purposes.  The standard weekly minimum rent contribution for a one parent family is &euro;30 with many recipients paying more than this amount due their assessable means (part-time work etc.), after the appropriate disregards, being above their appropriate SWA rate.</p>  <p>  This overarching policy concern of security of tenure is being addressed via the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme (HAP).  HAP has been designed to simplify the current system of housing supports, and it allows households that get full-time employment to remain in the new scheme (rent supplement is not generally payable where a person or their spouse or partner is in full-time employment, i.e. for 30 hours or more a week).  Under HAP, a &lsquo;differential rent&rsquo; based on household weekly income is paid in the same way rents are charged to tenants in local authority housing.</p>  <p>  The strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short-term income support, and is being facilitated with the introduction of the HAP.  The transfer of long-term recipients of rent supplement to HAP is expected to be completed by 2020 in line with targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; The Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.</p></reply>

Each case is assessed on its own merit and on a case by case basis, therefore a situation may arise where opinions differ.</p></reply>

Social welfare inspectors inspect a wide range of businesses, as part of their on-going compliance operations.  Inspections are also undertaken jointly with other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  In 2017 social welfare inspectors carried out 979 employer inspections.  In 2018, 1,273 employer inspections have been completed as of 9 September.</p>  <p>  With respect to the question of the number of inspections, which specifically related to false self-employment and the number of workers that are categorised as being in false self-employment, I regret that the Department does not collate statistics to report on this matter.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Scope section determines employment status and the correct class of pay-related social insurance (PRSI).  Where misclassification of workers as self-employed is detected, the correct status and class is determined and social insurance arrears are collected as required.  Under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, there are specific offences in relation to the incorrect classification of employment contributions.  On conviction, fines and/or imprisonment can ultimately be imposed.</p>  <p>  In May the Department had a significant media campaign on false self-employment.  The campaign was aimed at ensuring that there is better public awareness of the important service the Department provides in determining employment status and to help develop a better understanding of the scale and nature of false self-employment.  The main advertising campaign ran over a two week period, with digital and social media promotions continuing for a further two weeks.  The campaign directed people to a dedicated page on the Department&rsquo;s website as a first step.</p>  <p>  The new web page attracted more than 10,500 visits during the campaign with an average time of over three minutes spent on the page which is regarded as very favourable.</p>  <p>  Scope section received some 50 calls and 30 emails during the campaign from individuals who had become aware of the service directly as a result of the ad campaign.  Feedback suggests the detailed information available on the dedicated website appears to have been successful in addressing issues for many people.  The majority of callers confirmed that they had visited the website first before contacting the Department.  Ten formal applications for a Scope decision were registered.</p>  <p>  Social Welfare Inspectors are undertaking targeted employer inspections based on the feedback gathered during the campaign.  These will focus on the sectors identified and any companies reported to Scope section.  While the number of direct contacts with Scope section has been small, the campaign has been successful in raising public awareness about the issue of false self-employment.</p></reply>

It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and are in receipt of disability allowance, invalidity pension, incapacity supplement and blind pension.</p>  <p>  In June this year, I introduced a new telephone support allowance of &euro;2.50 per week for people who were in receipt of both the living alone allowance and fuel allowance, ensuring the additional payment was targeted at people living alone, including pensioners, of limited means.</p>  <p>  The appropriate rate of weekly social welfare payments, including pension payments and the Living Alone Allowance, will be considered by the Government in the context of the upcoming Budget, in light of available resources and other priorities.  In this regard, each &euro;1 increase in the Living Alone Allowance would cost an estimated &euro;10.9 million in 2019 and a full year.  This cost is subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2019.</p></reply>

While I understand this figure was calculated as approximately 37% in 2012, the latest EU Gender Pension Gap figure (including second and third pillar pensions), amounts to 26% in Ireland.  The equivalent figure across the EU is 37%, and so the Irish figure is significantly lower than the norm across Europe, rather than higher as suggested in the details supplied with the question.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that most of this gap refers to differences in payments from occupational and private pensions as conversely, the gap between average State pension payments to men and women over 66 made by my department is currently 1%.  This reflects the different dynamics of 4 state pension payments &ndash; 3 of which benefit women more than men, and one (the State pension contributory) which benefits men more than women.  Changing patterns in working lives over the decades are expected to continue to see the outcomes for male and female retirees converge over time.</p>  <p>  Another EU statistic is the gender gap among over 65s in the &ldquo;At Risk of Poverty and Social Exclusion (AROPE)&rdquo; indicator.  This gap is 2.0% in Ireland, compared to 5.6% in the EU, and is the 4th lowest among the 28 Member States.  The three countries with a lower gender gap in this measure than Ireland, all have a bigger Gender Pension Gap than we do.</p>  <p>  As a general policy, the Government intends to introduce a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to establishing level of entitlement for all new state pension contributory claims from 2020 onwards.  Separately, I announced on 23rd January an interim TCA for those affected by the 2012 rate-band changes.  Under this approach, a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 (i.e., who is among those affected by the new ratebands introduced from that date) and who has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.</p>  <p>  Up to 20 years of HomeCaring credits, and/or 10 years of other qualifying credits (e.g., when unemployed or ill) may be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.  It will make it easier for pensioners assessed under the yearly average model, to qualify for a higher rate of the State Pension (contributory).  This interim TCA will ensure that the totality of a person&rsquo;s social insurance contributions - as opposed to the timing of them - determines a final pension outcome.</p>  <p>  Legislation has to be drafted and enacted to enable implementation of these arrangements, and a number of options regarding the best approach to passing that legislation are being considered.  In addition, an information technology system has to be developed in line with the legislation.  My Department is currently working on both of these.  It is planned to commence the reviews before the end of this year, with the first payments being made in the first quarter of 2019 backdated to the end of March this year.</p>  <p>  My Department will write to the people impacted and provide them with the opportunity to have their pension calculation reviewed.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This will be a successor to the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 (NAPinclusion) and its 2015-2017 update which concluded last year. </p>  <p>  My department is developing the new four year plan for the period 2018-2021. Like its predecessor, the plan will have a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach that aims to improve outcomes for the vulnerable and marginalised in our society, while recognising a shared responsibility across Government to implement actions to achieve the overall objectives. The theme of the new plan is one of active inclusion, which will enable every citizen, notably the most disadvantaged, to fully participate in society, including having a job. </p>  <p>  The primary focus will be the reduction of consistent poverty, which in 2016 was 8.3%. This will be achieved through a three pronged approach: supporting incomes through as high as possible a level of employment, and encouraging and assisting people to enter the workforce; setting targets for the level of relevant welfare payments designed to reduce relative poverty among those who cannot (or cannot find) work; and finally improving access to quality services such as health, education, childcare, training, housing, community supports in order to minimize deprivation for all groups and, in particular those who are on relatively low incomes. </p>  <p>  Following a public consultation process and discussions with colleagues, both internally and in other departments, to identify specific actions for inclusion, drafting of the plan by my officials is at an advanced stage. It is my intention that the plan will be published in Autumn 2018. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-18a.2020.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018091800082#WREE01300"><p>Entitlements under the social welfare system are primarily based on a number of defined contingencies such as sickness, unemployment, old age or widowhood.  There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system.</p>  <p>  Firstly there is the contributory principle which links the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and their entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid, subject to legislative provisions, where a particular contingency arises, and without a means test.  </p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle where the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more likely to have an income need as a result of circumstances that have arisen in their lives.  In this regard, it should be noted that most PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  It should also be noted that access to Widow&rsquo;s/Widower&rsquo;s/Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension is available to those who have been married or in a civil partnership only, and that scheme will not benefit someone who has been single all their life. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the benefits and pension system is to provide a person with an adequate income.  The rate of payment is set with this objective in mind, and the fact that there are a number of ways one can qualify for a pension does not mean someone may qualify for multiple PRSI-funded payments at the same time.  As is common with social security systems across the world, the Irish social welfare system generally applies the principle of one person, one full payment. </p>  <p>  It can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time, e.g., an unemployed person may also become sick and incapable of work.  The PRSI paid by the person and their employers only provides coverage for one payment at such times.  Under the legislation for the schemes, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, generally he or she can receive only one core payment.  Amending the social welfare system to allow Illness Benefit (or Jobseekers Benefit if they are unemployed) to be paid in addition to a pension such as a Widow&rsquo;s pension would be a significant change to the system, as it would in effect be a double payment, providing certain people with the income currently paid for two people, and would greatly increase costs.  This extra cost would have to be financed from either an increase in the rate of PRSI contributions, an increase in the Exchequer subvention to the scheme, or a reduction in the rate of payments. </p>  <p>  There are a number of supports in the social welfare system which benefit widows, including those of working age such as the Fuel Allowance Scheme. To receive Fuel Allowance, Widows pension recipients must also satisfy the other conditions for that payment, i.e., be unable to provide for their heating needs from the resources of their household, live alone or only with one of a list of exempted persons, and satisfy a means test. </p>  <p>  In addition, a widow aged between 60 and 65 years, whose late spouse/civil partner received the Household Benefits package from this Department, may qualify for that package if they otherwise satisfy all other conditions and receive a relevant qualifying payment. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them. The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement. </p>  <p>  The Department was a member of the Inter-Departmental Advisory Group for the Review of the DEIS Programme undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills (DES), following which DEIS Plan 2017 was published in February 2017. The Plan sets out targets and actions aimed at improving the educational outcome for pupils at greatest risk of not reaching their full potential by virtue of their socio-economic circumstances. </p>  <p>  Some 240 additional schools, including DEIS and non-DEIS schools, were identified to receive support under the school meals scheme from September 2017 in consultation with DES, which has developed a more robust and responsive framework for assessing individual schools levels of concentrated disadvantage as part of this process. </p>  <p>  In 2018 the Department liaised with DES with a view to including additional non-DEIS schools in the scheme, deemed in need of support under the school meals programme, from September.

Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.  </p>  <p>  Credited contributions, normally known as credits, are awarded to recipients of carer&rsquo;s benefit and of carer&rsquo;s allowance where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Recipients of these payments qualify for credits where they have at least one paid contribution in the previous two years or have had credited contributions in that period.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid carer&rsquo;s leave from work.  </p>  <p>  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.</p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who do not qualify for a payment or for credits, may qualify for the homemaker scheme.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for state pension (contributory).  Years spent caring on a full-time basis are disregarded when calculating the state pension (contributory) rate of payment. </p>  <p>  Through the award of credits and the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, the social insurance system already gives significant recognition of the service provided by carers.  Awarding paid contributions would be contrary to the principle that entitlement to social insurance benefits, as a right, is directly linked to the actual payment of PRSI contributions on income and to do so would have cost implications which would need to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the key role carers play in society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review. However, any improvements or additions to these supports can only be considered in a budgetary context  and in the light of available financial resources.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66. This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028. The Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 has stated that future changes in State pension age will be decided on research into life expectancy. </p>  <p>  As a result of considerable demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by roughly &euro;1 billion every 5 years. This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  </p>  <p>  Census 2016 has confirmed that the population of over 65&rsquo;s increased by 19.1% to approximately 638,000 over the preceding 5 years.  The ratio of the number of people of State pension age and above relative to the size of the working age population is projected to change from the 2015 rate of 4.9:1 to 2.7:1 by 2045.  This will be paralleled by an increase in the number of years spent in retirement and over which pensions payments are required.  </p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (although at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension. </p>  <p>  It is estimated that the net saving in 2019 is likely to be in the region of over &euro;85 million, and this is expected to increase over time.  </p>  <p>  However this would not be the total cost of reducing the State pension age for existing State pension payments.  If the age for the State pension (contributory) and the State pension (non-contributory) were both reduced to 65 from 66, rather than the reintroduction of State pension (transition), there would be an additional cost as the State pension (contributory) does not have the retirement criterion that the State pension (transition) did.  There would, therefore, be an additional cost to the Social Insurance Fund, paid in respect of people who would still work while aged 65, in addition to receiving the State Pension (contributory).  There would also be an additional cost in respect of those with insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for the State pension (contributory) who, prior to 2014, would still have to work until 66 to qualify for a pension. It is unclear what that additional cost would amount to, but it would mean that the cost would be significantly higher than the estimated cost for re-introduction of the State pension (transition).</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.</p>  <p>  Where this is not possible, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-18a.2074.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018091800082#WREE06700"><p>Entitlements under the social welfare system are primarily based on a number of defined contingencies such as sickness, unemployment, old age or widowhood. There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system. </p>  <p>  Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Secondly, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, but is based on social insurance contributions, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Accordingly, it is important to ensure those qualifying for the State pension contributory have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  The idea of a universal State pension, paid at full rate to everyone over 66, regardless of their contributions or their means, has been proposed on a number of occasions, and officials in my Department have examined such proposals a number of times.  There are significant issues regarding the scope such a pension would have, particularly in respect of its interaction with public service pensions, and with occupational pensions in companies that were previously part of the public service.  Additionally, consideration would have to be given to the treatment of retirees who are not resident in the State, but who have built up a contributory pension entitlement over the years that they worked here and paid PRSI.  There are also potential legal issues regarding treating occupational pensions differently when they are in the public or private sector.</p>  <p>  These factors make precise costing of such a pension challenging.  However, it is clear that regardless of decisions made regarding these factors, the cost would be very substantial, and officials in my Department believe that the additional cost could be expected to be over &euro;1 billion per annum, and potentially substantially more depending on some of the factors I mention above.  </p>  <p>  Clearly, this would either be very expensive or, if introduced on a cost-neutral basis, require very significant diversion of funds from elsewhere, e.g. a large reduction in the current rate of the State pension, substantial increases in the rate of PRSI deductions, or equivalent measures reducing tax relief on occupational and private pensions, which would impact very significantly upon the take-home pay of the workers affected, and act as a disincentive to such pension provision. </p>  <p>  The biggest beneficiaries would be people who, not only contributed less to the Social Insurance Fund, but who have significant additional means, resulting in their not qualifying for a non-contributory pension, which is paid at up to 95% that of the maximum contributory pension rate.  Those who contributed most to the system, including those with no additional means, and widows depending on a single pension from the state, would receive no benefit at all from the additional spending involved.  However, such people could be significantly impacted by any subsequent restraint in increases in the rate of the pension caused by the larger state pension bill faced by the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  Any changes to pension entitlements would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Firstly, in terms of affordable housing for purchase, relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 have been commenced, which place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing. This Scheme, aimed at households, including any qualifying military personnel, earning low to moderate annual gross incomes of maximum &euro;50,000 for a single applicant and maximum &euro;75,000 for joint applicants, will be delivered by local authorities developing their sites in key locations. The Scheme will be complementary to other Government Schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan scheme.</p>  <p>  Secondly, I am determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live aswell as work. Cost rental is an important component of progressive housing systems around Europe. Two cost rental projects have previously been announced for Emmet Road, Inchicore, and at Enniskerry Road, Dundrum. Learning from these pilot projects, I expect cost rental projects to be rolled out across other suitable sites.</p>  <p>  Finally, in order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  This overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will provide funding for those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing. The bids received from local authorities under the first call are now being assessed, and I expect to make initial funding awards next month. </p>  <p>  Based on preliminary estimates, the local authorities in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, Cork and Galway, have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes. My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites for at least 10,000 new affordable homes, and that analysis is progressing well.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Government has now launched the Land Development Agency which is aiming to build some 150,000 new homes over the next 20 years. The new Agency has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, with at least 40% of these homes being for social and affordable housing purposes.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive.  </p><p>SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  Following a tendering process, my Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced in the coming weeks, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in early 2019.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property. Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an AHB.</p><p>To further assist the re-activation of vacant properties, my Department introduced a Buy &amp;amp; Renew (B&amp;amp;R) Scheme to facilitate local authorities in acquiring and remediating vacant properties that may be suitable for social housing. The properties involved can range from those in good condition to those that need remediation and may have been vacant. To ensure a local-led response to such work, responsibility for property acquisitions is delegated to local authorities.</p><p>As with standard acquisitions, local authorities have delegated responsibility to utilise the B&amp;amp;R Scheme, as part of the blend of property acquisitions, as appropriate to their area, given housing need and the availability of properties of different types.</p><p>Further funding initiatives such as Long-Term Leasing, Home Renovation Incentives and Better Energy Homes Grants are also important in feeding into the re-introduction of vacant homes to the usable housing stock. </p><p>Similarly, my Department has, earlier this year, introduced new planning regulations which allow change of use, and related works, of certain vacant commercial premises, including &ldquo;over the shop&rdquo; type properties, into residential use without the need to obtain planning permission.</p><p>The Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), also known as the &quot;Fair Deal&quot; Scheme, was published by the Minister for Health in July 2015. A Working Group is overseeing the implementation of its recommendations, including any legislative changes that may be required.  In this regard, Action 17 of the <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>undertakes to examine the treatment under the NHSS&rsquo;s financial assessment of income from the rental of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence (PPR), where they move into long-term residential care. This examination aims to explore the potential to encourage vacant accommodation to be brought into active use.</p><p>My Department and the Department of Health are examining the treatment under the NHSS's financial assessment of income from the rental of a person&rsquo;s principal private residence where they move into long-term residential care.  In this context, the Department of Health has received legal advice to the effect that changes to the treatment of rental income in the Scheme would require primary legislation. A number of options for policy and legislative change have now been identified and will be the subject of further discussion and exploration between the two Departments with a view to eliminating any financial disincentives that may currently exist to letting homes while the owners are in nursing home care. </p><p>Discussions are also taking place between the two Departments with regard to the treatment of the proceeds from the sale of a principal private residence in the context of the financial assessment of applicants for the NHSS scheme and of existing participants within the scheme. The aim is to encourage relevant vacant properties back into active use.</p></reply>

All landlords, including those in receipt of Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p><p>HAP is underpinned by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. Under section 41 of the 2014 Act, local authorities are required to commence the inspection process within 8 months of the commencement of HAP support being provided in relation to a particular dwelling if not already inspected within the previous 12 months. HAP may be provided on a property which is the subject of a subsisting improvement notice under section 18A of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.

Local authorities are currently recording inspection activity across a range of data systems, and the SSC is working closely with local authorities to ensure that data in relation to HAP related inspections is recorded on the new HAP module. This involves the migration of some historic data and the refinement of existing data management practices to ensure that overall, the data is being managed efficiently.

The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 provides for a court order on application by the tenant, tenant purchaser or the housing authority or approved body concerned, which has the effect of excluding a household member engaged in anti-social behaviour from the dwelling and, if appropriate, from the estate in question for a maximum period of three years. The Act also empowers a housing authority to refuse to allocate or sell a dwelling to a person engaged in anti-social behaviour or in the interest of good estate management.</p>  <p>  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 strengthened the powers of housing authorities in relation to securing excluding orders where there is anti-social behaviour in their housing stock. Part 2 of the 2014 Act prescribes procedures to deal with serious breaches of the tenancy agreements for their dwellings, including anti-social behaviour and strengthens the power of housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households in serious breach of their tenancy agreements, including engaging in anti-social behaviour.

We are working with all Dublin local authorities to see these sites are brought forward as quickly as possible, with the optimum tenure mix and ensuring the greatest value for money for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, it is a matter for the local authority and its elected members to agree the optimal approach to development and financing. In this context, agreeing the annual budget, authorising borrowing and the disposal of land are all reserved functions. All borrowing by local authorities is of course subject to the overall limits which are set by the Government from time to time in the context of the General Government Balance.</p>  <p>  For my part, I have made it clear that direct Exchequer funding will be provided for any social housing element of these mixed-tenure developments. In addition, both sites identified in this question are designated as Major Urban Housing Development sites. In recognition of this, I am keen to support their development and have committed combined funding of &euro;8.5 million under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) to provide public infrastructure which will open up the two sites for development. </p>  <p>  In order to support the development and financing of social and affordable housing projects, my Department has engaged extensively with the European Investment Bank with regard to financing options and also leveraging the Bank's vast experience and knowledge in developing and supporting public housing projects in other Member States.  Local authorities have also engaged directly with the EIB for the same purpose. </p>  <p>  I and my Department will continue to work with local authorities on their major mixed-tenure housing projects to help them ensure the optimal delivery outcome.</p></reply>

Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p><p>In addition, local authorities also have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and put a plan in place for works to bring buildings into compliance. They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis.  Given these clear statutory roles, it is the local authority that the residents concerned should engage with.</p><p>In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, it was agreed that a review be undertaken by an independent fire expert to develop a framework for general application.  In August 2017, the <i>Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings </i>was published, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework will also be of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations. The framework contains the following:<i></i></p><p><i>- </i>an explanation of the statutory provisions in respect of fire safety, namely the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014 and the Fire Services Acts 1981 &amp;amp; 2003, and the respective responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, occupants, local authorities; </p><p>- a range of actions that may reduce risk and improve the level of fire safety where deficiencies arise in dwelling houses, apartments and /or the common areas of apartment buildings; and </p><p>- a fire risk assessment methodology for professional advisors to prioritise the remedial actions, if any, that may need to be carried out on a dwelling.</p><p>Additionally, in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy in June 2017, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, Minister Murphy asked the Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management to convene and coordinate a Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland. The work of the Task Force has now been completed and its findings are reflected in &ldquo;Fire Safety in Ireland: Report of the Fire Safety Task Force&rdquo;, which is available on the Department's website at the following link:  <i><i>.</i></i></p><p>The Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has now been mandated to oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations.</p></reply>

The Survey, which covers metropolitan housing markets in nine countries (Australia, Canada, China, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States), uses data for the third quarter of 2017 and covers areas in Ireland with a population of 50,000 people or more. It reported that, relative to household income, Ireland has the most affordable housing costs compared to all other countries included in the Survey. It does, however, point to a significant affordability challenge in Dublin and an affordability issue in Cork and Galway. </p>  <p>  As Minister, I have been clear that we need to address housing affordability, recognising the pressures that exist for low- to middle-income households, particularly in Dublin and certain other of our main urban centres. The delivery of targeted affordable housing, for purchase and rent, was a priority topic at the Housing Summit which I held with Local Authority Chief Executives in July. It is also featured prominently at the post-Housing Summit meeting with Local Authority Housing Directors of Service and at a Forum I held with Approved Housing Bodies on 17 September.</p>  <p>  A three-pronged, targeted approach to affordable housing provision is being pursued, aimed at households earning low to moderate annual gross incomes at a maximum of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.  Firstly, in terms of affordable housing for purchase, I have now commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing. This Scheme will be delivered by local authorities developing sites in key locations. The Scheme will be complementary to other Government schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p>  <p>  Secondly, I am also determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future. There is a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live aswell as work. Cost rental is an important component of progressive housing systems around Europe. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I have announced details of a major cost rental project with the potential to deliver over 300 cost rental homes at Emmet Road, Inchicore, as part of a mixed-tenure development of some 470 homes in total. In parallel, the Housing Agency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have been working on a smaller-scale cost rental pilot, at Enniskerry Road, the tenders for which will issue shortly.  Learning from these pilot projects, cost rental will now be rolled out across other suitable sites.</p>  <p>  Finally, in order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing &euro;75 million in Exchequer funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  The bids received from local authorities under this first call are now being assessed and I expect to make initial funding awards next month.  </p>  <p>  From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites for at least 10,000 new affordable homes from local authority-owned land.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has now launched the Land Development Agency, which will be aiming to deliver some 150,000 new homes over the next 20 years. The new Agency has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites, and will deliver at least 40% of any housing potential on such lands for both social and affordable housing purposes.</p></reply>

Section 149(4) of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, states that every function of a local authority which is not a reserved function is an executive function. The division of reserved and executive functions is such that the Chief Executive operates within a framework of policy laid down by the elected members. </p>  <p>  It is not within the remit of a Chief Executive of a local authority to change reserved functions to executive functions. </p></reply>

My Department has recognised the need to support local authorities in their efforts to increase both capacity and output in this regard. In addition to substantial capital and current funding provided under Rebuilding Ireland, additional dedicated co-ordinated support resources including the Housing Delivery Office, my Department is providing a range of additional staff related supports including:</p><p>- Local authorities have designated Vacant Homes Officers to act as a central point of contact and to provide information and advice for owners of vacant homes and also to deal with queries from members of the public in respect of private residential vacant properties in their administrative area.  My Department has provided funding for each local authority (&euro;50,000 per annum, for a period of two years (i.e. a total of &euro;100,000 to each local authority for 2018 &amp;amp; 2019)) to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. The provision of central funding will allow for focus to be given to the role of the Office in establishing a co-ordinated approach towards the implementation of their Vacant Homes Action Plans and will reinforce the capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority. The Vacant Homes Office is expected to play a key role in the co-ordination of this work within the local authority.</p><p>- Earlier this year my Department advised local authorities of arrangements for the appointment (where required) of a dedicated staff member to provide assistance in seeking out potential properties; establishing relationships with local property agents and landlords; supporting those homeless households to exit emergency accommodation and secure a tenancy. An allowance towards the staffing cost of this officer is recoupable from the Department via the homeless services (&lsquo;Section 10&rsquo;) recoupment arrangements.</p><p>- The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and a range of different leasing schemes funded by the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) all provide local authorities with administrative payments in respect of new households entering the schemes and for certain on-going monitoring and management expenses. The purpose of these payments is to recognise the resources required by local authorities in respect of the set up and management of tenancies under these programmes. </p><p>- Local authority in-house professional services assigned to the delivery of new capital funded social housing build projects can be recouped from the Department at a percentage of the approved tender cost, with the actual percentage depending on the services provided.  Services covered include architectural and other design team professional services, contract monitoring and management and the assigned certifier role.  </p><p>At a general level, section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. </p><p>My Department oversees workforce planning for the local government sector, including the monitoring of local government sector employment levels. To this end, my Department gathers quarterly data on staff numbers in local authorities; however, the data gathered does not provide details in terms of the increases in staff in Council housing departments. Accordingly, the information requested is not available in my Department, but may be obtained directly from the individual local authorities concerned.</p><p>Since 1 January 2016, my Department has received 124 housing-related staff sanction requests from Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council, 120 of which have been approved, with 4 pending. Posts that are pending, in general, are awaiting supporting information prior to a final decision being taken.<table><tr><th>Local authority </th><th>2016 </th><th>2017 </th><th>2018 @17/9 </th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council</td><td>15 </td><td>23 </td><td>33 </td><td>71 </td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire - Rathdown County Council</td><td>4 </td><td>2 </td><td>17 </td><td>23 </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>2 </td><td>8 </td><td>15 </td><td>25 </td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council</td><td>5 </td><td>0 </td><td>0 </td><td>5 </td></tr><tr><td>Total per year </td><td>26 </td><td>33 </td><td>65 </td><td>124 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

My Department has recognised the need to support local authorities in their efforts to increase both capacity and output in this regard. In addition to substantial capital and current funding provided under Rebuilding Ireland, additional dedicated co-ordinated support resources including the Housing Delivery Office, my Department is providing a range of additional staff related supports including:  </p><p>- Local authorities have designated Vacant Homes Officers to act as a central point of contact and to provide information and advice for owners of vacant homes and also to deal with queries from members of the public in respect of private residential vacant properties in their administrative area.  My Department has provided funding for each local authority (&euro;50,000 per annum, for a period of two years (i.e. a total of &euro;100,000 to each local authority for 2018 &amp;amp; 2019)) to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. The provision of central funding will allow for focus to be given to the role of the Office in establishing a co-ordinated approach towards the implementation of their Vacant Homes Action Plans and will reinforce the capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority. The Vacant Homes Office is expected to play a key role in the co-ordination of this work within the local authority.</p><p>- Earlier this year my Department advised local authorities of arrangements for the appointment (where required) of a dedicated staff member to provide assistance in seeking out potential properties; establishing relationships with local property agents and landlords; supporting those homeless households to exit emergency accommodation and secure a tenancy. An allowance towards the staffing cost of this officer is recoupable from the Department via the homeless services (&lsquo;Section 10&rsquo;) recoupment arrangements.</p><p>- The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and a range of different leasing schemes funded by the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) all provide local authorities with administrative payments in respect of new households entering the schemes and for certain on-going monitoring and management expenses. The purpose of these payments is to recognise the resources required by local authorities in respect of the set up and management of tenancies under these programmes. </p><p>- Local authority in-house professional services assigned to the delivery of new capital funded social housing build projects can be recouped from the Department at a percentage of the approved tender cost, with the actual percentage depending on the services provided.  Services covered include architectural and other design team professional services, contract monitoring and management and the assigned certifier role. At a general level, section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. </p><p>My Department oversees workforce planning for the local government sector, including the monitoring of local government sector employment levels. To this end, my Department gathers quarterly data on staff numbers in local authorities; however, the data gathered does not provide details in terms of the increases in staff in Council housing departments approved and funded by Councils. Accordingly, the information requested is not available in my Department, but may be obtained directly from the individual local authorities concerned. </p><p>Since 1 January 2014, my Department has received 870 housing-related staff sanction requests from local authorities, 859 of which have been approved, with 11 pending. Posts that are pending, in general, are awaiting supporting information prior to a final decision being taken.<table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Number of posts</th></tr><tr><td>2014 </td><td>18 </td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>400 </td></tr><tr><td>2016 </td><td>139 </td></tr><tr><td>2017 </td><td>127 </td></tr><tr><td>2018 </td><td>186 </td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>870 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The purpose of the Manual is to ensure that the welfare and needs of pedestrians are prioritised in the design of streets in urban areas, so that roadways for cars do not dominate our towns and cities. It also promotes design approaches that better facilitate and encourage pedestrian movement, and is fully consistent with national planning policy objectives to create more compact settlements. </p>  <p>  Supplementary material is currently being prepared for inclusion in the Manual towards providing greater design clarity. This is likely to include material around a universal design approach to meet the needs of all people regardless of age, size, ability and disability particularly where shared spaces are proposed.</p>  <p>  While I am aware of the changes taking place in the UK in relation to shared space and road schemes, it should be noted that the design and construction standards for public roads are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>  <p>  In relation to the building regulations, the aim of the building regulations is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. The building regulations apply to the design and construction of a new building (including a dwelling) or an extension to an existing building as well as for material alterations and certain material changes of use to existing buildings.</p>  <p>  Part M of the Building Regulations provides that adequate provision shall be made for people to access and use a building, its facilities and environs. The accompanying Technical Guidance Document M (TGD M) provides detailed guidance on how this may be achieved in practice.</p></reply>

This Scheme will be delivered by local authorities developing their sites in key locations. The Scheme complements other Government Schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. </p>  <p>  In addition, it is important that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future to fill a gap between social housing and the rental market, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.  A number of pilot cost rental schemes are being advanced at Enniskerry Road, in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown and at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, Dublin 8. Once these have progressed satisfactorily, I plan to roll out cost rental across other suitable sites.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing substantial Exchequer funding of &euro;75 million for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  The call for proposals under the Serviced Site Fund issued in June, with a closing date of 31st August.  The bids received from local authorities under this first call are now being assessed and I expect to make initial funding awards early next month.  </p>  <p>  From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area, as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites which would see the level of ambition increase to at least 10,000 new affordable homes from local authority-owned land.</p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously, including at the Third Housing Summit with Local Authority Chief Executives in early July, and the follow-up session with LA Directors of Housing, the provision of affordable housing should be targeted in areas where the market is failing to provide such affordable homes to buy or rent and is unlikely to do so in the near future. </p>  <p>  In order to evaluate the necessity and feasibility of providing affordable housing and the financial assessment of the viability of local authority sites, authorities need to carry out an economic assessment of housing affordability locally.  My Department will be writing to local authorities to ensure a uniform and consistent approach to this assessment nationally.</p></reply>

HAP is a form of social housing support that allows tenants to work full-time and retain their housing support so in many cases, people may make choices about affordability taking this into consideration.</p><p>It should be noted that local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that tenancies are sustainable and are advised not to provide HAP support to tenancies where the household would not be in a position to meet the rental costs being sought.</p></reply>

However, in considering that figure, it should be noted that those numbers were recorded at a single point in time and included houses for sale or for rent, as well as homes that are not recoverable for occupancy for a wide range of reasons.</p><p>My Department, in conjunction with the local government sector, is working on more accurately identifying the numbers of vacant buildings in between Census dates and understanding the reasons behind that vacancy. In order to more accurately determine the levels of long-term vacant but recoverable dwellings that can be re-introduced into the liveable housing stock, the Department, working with the Housing Agency, the CSO and local authorities, has developed a survey methodology in relation to locating vacant housing.  A pilot field-based survey has commenced across six local authorities. To identify long-term vacancy, the pilot will require two visual inspections, six months apart, with those houses occupied between the two inspections disregarded. </p><p>The aim of the pilot survey being undertaken is not only to count the number of vacant homes, but also to visually assess the condition of these homes and to focus particularly on areas where there is a high demand for homes, which have vacant or under-utilised houses capable of being brought back into use.  The results of the pilot field-based survey will be analysed to assess whether there would be significant value in rolling out the survey on a national basis.</p><p>My Department has also made funding available for a Vacant Homes Office in each local authority that will undertake the follow-on work needed to ensure that the owners of vacant properties are engaged with and informed about their options, should they wish to bring their properties back into the liveable housing stock.</p><p>The following table provides national and Dublin City vacancy data drawn from Census 2011 and Census 2016. This data excludes &ldquo;temporarily vacant homes&rdquo; and &ldquo;holiday homes&rdquo; in the classification of vacant dwellings. <table><tr><th>(National and Dublin only) Dwelling Type</th><th>National 2011</th><th>National 2016</th><th>Dublin City 2011</th><th>Dublin City 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Unoccupied - vacant house</td><td>168,427</td><td>140,120</td><td>7,995</td><td>7,457</td></tr><tr><td>Unoccupied - vacant flat</td><td>61,629</td><td>43,192</td><td>16,321</td><td>10,967</td></tr><tr><td>Vacancy Rate: </td><td>11.53%</td><td>9.15%</td><td>10.06%</td><td>7.66%</td></tr></table></p><p>Between 2011 and 2016, the national vacancy rate fell from 11.53% to 9.15%. Dublin City&rsquo;s vacancy rate also fell, from 10.06% to 7.66%. </p><p>In the case of vacant social housing stock, between 2015 and 2017, Dublin City Council restored 2,866 such units and recovered them in to use as residential social lettings. To date in 2018, Dublin City Council has recovered an additional 267 units into use as residential social lettings.  Over 2,100 of these units were supported, with some &euro;33m in funding, under the Voids Programme through which my Department provides support to local authorities in preparing vacant units for re-letting. The purpose of the Voids Programme is to ensure that vacant units are actively targeted, with a view to minimising the turnaround and re-let time of these units and return them to use in an energy efficient condition. </p><p>In an effort to tackle vacancy among the private dwelling stock in the city, and under Objective 2 of the National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy, Dublin City Council is actively promoting two government schemes with private property owners of vacant dwellings, namely the &lsquo;Buy and Renew&rsquo; and &lsquo;Repair and Lease&rsquo; schemes. </p><p>The following table summarises the results of efforts by Dublin City Council to promote the &lsquo;Buy and Renew&rsquo; and &lsquo;Repair and Lease&rsquo; Schemes. There are currently 337 identified vacant dwellings that Dublin City Council consider are potentially suited for the &lsquo;Buy and Renew&rsquo; and &lsquo;Repair and Lease&rsquo; schemes. Of these, 160 of these have been inspected and subsequently a title search has been conducted for 87 units. Title research was not conducted on all inspected properties as some did not appear un-occupied or long-term vacant when inspected while others were sale agreed, under refurbishment, demolished or subject to planning applications.<table><tr><th>Summary Data for DCC &lsquo;Buy and Renew&rsquo; and &lsquo;Repair and Lease&rsquo; schemes.

Such counter-cyclical action will be aimed at stabilising any tendency towards volatility in development land values, securing more of the increase in such values as a result of the planning and infrastructure investment processes for the common good and thereby driving increased affordability through better and more cost-competitive land availability.</p>  <p>  The Agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Central Mental Hospital site in Dundrum, discussions have been ongoing between the landowners [Office of Public Works/Health Service Executive] and the LDA and it has been agreed that the LDA will manage the pre-development activities to prepare the site for future development, pending the decanting of the existing users of the site to alternative facilities, which is anticipated to conclude in Q3 2020, after which a development programme is anticipated to commence, subject to securing the necessary planning and other relevant consents in the meantime.</p>  <p>  Initial assessments place the potential development yield from the site at around 1,500 new homes. In addition and as a result of the Government&rsquo;s new public lands affordability requirements agreed in the context of bringing forward the LDA, a minimum of 30% of any housing developed on public lands must be reserved for affordable purposes, in addition to the 10% social housing requirement of Part V of the Planning and Development Act. </p>  <p>  The immediate priority for the site is the preparation of a development strategy by the LDA in the coming months, including how the social and affordable housing elements, including  any cost rental element, will be deployed. </p></reply>

Key highlights of this capital investment include:</p>  <p>  - The on-going management, development and operation of our 87,000 hectare National Park and Nature Reserve Network.</p>  <p>  - The expansion of Wicklow Mountains National Park with the purchase of 4,900 acres (or 1,983 hectares) of the Dublin Uplands, in the area known popularly as the Featherbeds. This land increased the total size of the National Park to over 22,000 hectares. The Department completed the purchase in December 2016 for &euro;800,000.00</p>  <p>  - &euro;390,000 was spent in 2017 on consolidating National Parks property. The Department purchased an OPW property in Corofin for future use in respect of the Burren National Park, and purchased 800 acres at Altnabrockey in Mayo to consolidate its holding in the Wild Nephin.</p>  <p>  - Trail maintenance continued with on-going upgrades to the popular Diamond Hill in Connemara National park, the resurfacing of the Blue Road at Shrahduggan in Ballycroy National Park and on-going clearance of scrub and invasive species in a number of National Parks and Nature Reserves.</p>  <p>  - Upgrading of the road network in Killarney National Park and the restoration of the historic windows and essential maintenance and restoration works to the roof of Muckross House.</p>  <p>  With regard to 2018 expenditure by my Department, the Deputy will be aware, that such expenditure is presently on-going  and subject to internal verification and monitoring processes. Adjustments may fall to be made between subheads as part of this process and all figures are subject to audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  2018 expenditure will include the conclusion of the multi-million euro investment in the restoration Killarney House and Gardens. Following on from the successful opening of the restored ornamental gardens in April 2016 and the opening of the 3 Historic Rooms of Killarney House in July 2017 the Department&rsquo;s phased completion of the Killarney House &amp;amp; Gardens project at Killarney National Park will conclude with the formal opening of the 18 Room Visitor Centre and Exhibition on the 28th of September, 2018. Roughly 55,000 people have visited the rooms since their opening in July 2017 with more than 375,000 visitors to the Garden since their opening in April 2016. </p>  <p>  In addition to such direct investments by my Department, the Deputy will also be aware that the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department has been proactively working in partnership with other State agencies, to further develop the Park and Reserves Network and support marketing initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East</p>  <p>  In December 2017, the Department announced the expansion of Ballycroy National Park with the addition of the Wild Nephin area, expanding the total size of the National Park to over 15,000 hectares. This was the culmination of constructive engagement between Coillte and the Department addressing a long-standing strategy to align key environmental assets. The National Parks and Wildlife Service will now manage this transfer of land and a public amenity conversion plan will be put in place. Overall, the project reflects the on-going commitment of all stakeholders to improve the recreational potential of this area whilst ensuring the highest standards of nature conservation. Work in this regard is on-going.</p>  <p>  In January 2017, the Department entered into Strategic Investment Partnership with Fa&iacute;lte Ireland, aimed at enhancing and promoting the tourism offering at Ireland&rsquo;s National Parks and also conserving and protecting the natural environments of the National Parks for the enjoyment of future generations. Since then, more than &euro;400k has been expended on scoping and feasibility studies for the development of capital projects. In July of this year, as part of this partnership, we published Experiencing the Wild heart of Ireland &ndash; A Tourism Interpretative Masterplan for the National Parks and Nature Reserves.  The Plan sets out a framework that will guide the phased development of enhanced visitor experiences and improved visitor facilities at our National Parks and Reserves, taking into account our  conservational objectives and based upon research into international best practice.  </p>  <p>  The plan recommends a suite of capital projects of varying size (from smaller scale interventions such as installation of viewing platforms to larger projects such as the development of new boardwalks and trails, to the construction of new visitor centres). From these proposals, projects will be funded jointly by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and F&aacute;ilte Ireland through a multi-million Euro investment package over the coming years. The first such project, a &euro;2.1m investment in Wild Nephin- Ballycroy National Park was announced on the 31st of August, 2018 to develop a continuous 53km walking cycling trail from Newport to Ballycastle on the Wild Atlantic Way through the National Park.  At present a section of the waymarked Western Way (200km linear trail from Galway to Mayo) runs north-southwards through the eastern portion of Wild Nephin providing a continuous 53km walking cycling trail from Newport to Ballycastle on the Wild Atlantic Way.  This project will eliminate the need to walk the busy R312 by creating a spur which will provide a more direct and safe route on quiet tracks through bogland and forests. The outcome of this project will be an off road continuous cycling and walking trail in challenging terrain which will link the popular Great Western Greenway with the Wild Atlantic Way.  This 56km section of the Western Way has potential to be walked/cycled for its full 56km and be promoted internationally as a unique, off road Grade 3 trail of scale to meet the rising demand for challenging outdoor recreational activity that is away from it all. The funding will provide opportunities for existing and new private sector operators in bike hire, guiding, outdoor recreation and will in time, support the accommodation and food sectors. The experience will appeal to domestic and international visitors that seek an off-road, wild experience on the western edge of Europe. Importantly, the project will ensure that the area is accessed in a sustainable way, protecting the habitat and directing tourists through a managed route.</p>  <p>  In addition to its interactions with Faillte and Coillte, the Department has successfully operated a joint management arrangement the Trustees of Muckross House since the early 1980s. As part of the Department and the Trustees ongoing commitment to the development, conservation and presentation of Killarney National Park, a regular programme of jointly funded capital projects are undertaken.  A restoration of the of the Victorian Servants&rsquo; Dining Hall and Laundry Room in the basement of Muckross House was commenced last year and is due to finish shortly. It is estimated that the total costs associated with this restoration project will be in the order of &euro;400,000.  This latest project at Muckross House follows on from the significant investment in refurbishing the original metal-framed windows, which also included repairs to the roof, chimneys, gutters and downpipes, during 2016 and 2017.  These capital investment projects at Muckross House, derive directly from the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department and the Board of Trustees, providing tangible evidence of the cooperation of a Government Department and a locally based not-for-profit body.</p>  <p>  Under "Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage, 2018 &ndash; 2027" capital investment of some &euro;50m has been earmarked for the National Parks and Nature Reserves. This investment ensures long term protection of the National Parks and Reserves and my Department is delighted to have this opportunity for investment and implementation of measures to protect our habitats, landscapes and wildlife.</p></reply>
