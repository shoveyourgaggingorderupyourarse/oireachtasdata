The results are encouraging with 14,276 site visits to fetchcourses.ie and 26,439 site visits to apprenticeship.ie by 1st   March. </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the project with a view to further developing and expanding CAO FET offers building on the experience of the 2022 application process.</p>  <p>  Also, in line with the strategic objective of building a well-functioning unified knowledge and skills system across further and higher education, research and innovation, my Department is identifying an initial set of actions to realise that objective and promote unity across the various sectors.  I intend to bring greater detail on the development of this policy to Government in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

These range in duration from 2-4 years. They comprise both on-the-job and off-the-job phases. The off-the-job training is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology, Technological Universities and other higher education institutions, depending on the programme in question. </p>  <p>  A further 17 additional programmes are being developed across agriculture, construction, engineering, equine, finance, horticulture, hospitality and food, ICT and logistics. A number of other potential apprenticeships are at an exploratory stage, in sectors such as health, beauty, environmental, engineering, ICT and finance. </p>  <p>  Among the 62 apprenticeships, construction related programmes include electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery, plastering, painting and decorating and the recently launched scaffolding apprenticeship. Apprenticeships are also in development in roofing and cladding (L5) and advanced quantity surveyor (L9). </p>  <p>  In recent years, annual intake in construction related apprenticeships has steadily been increasing, from a low of 650 in 2010 rising to 3,499 in 2019. In 2021, a record 8,607 new apprentices were registered. This was an almost 40% increase on the figures from 2019, the last &ldquo;normal&rdquo; pre-pandemic year. 6,955 of these registrations were in craft apprenticeships, and of these, 5,181 were in construction and electrical apprenticeships. As of January 2022 (the latest full month figures available), there have been 524 apprenticeship registrations, with 376 of these on construction-related programmes.</p></reply>

In Ireland this includes further and higher education. Expenditure covers not just government expenditure but also expenditure by households; and expenditure from international and private sources. For Ireland, the most recent OECD report based on financial data for 2018 suggests tertiary education expenditure represented 0.9% of GDP, compared to an OECD average of 1.4%.  However, in reality this comparison is not meaningful, given that GDP is not a good measure of the size of the domestic economy in Ireland.  This is borne out by the fact that average figures for expenditure per student at tertiary level were slightly above the OECD average.</p>  <p>  In terms of a more meaningful and recent comparison it is possible to give a general approximation of GDP, GNI and modified GNI proportions for the publicly funded Higher Education system, comprising funding investment by my Department towards grant funding and student support expenditure.</p>  <p>  Based on the Central Statistics Office's assessment of the size of the economy in 2020 and expenditure on higher education via my Department for that year, the proportion of national income on higher education and student support was in the order of:</p>  <p>  - Around 0.6% as a proportion of GDP;</p>  <p>  - Around 0.8% as a proportion of GNI. </p>  <p>  - Around 1.1% as a proportion of modified GNI, which is the measure which most accurately represents the size of the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  It is also important to say that public investment in higher education through my Departments allocation is on an upward trend, and now stands at &euro;2.4 billion. Annual current expenditure has increased by 40% since 2015.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing the process of investing in our higher education system and to the development and implementation of a sustainable funding, reform and performance model for the sector.</p></reply>

That is why Government launched Housing for All led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage which sets out a series of actions which will be delivered to address the housing crisis backed by a transformative budget of &euro;20 billion. </p>  <p>  In their ambition to deliver student accommodation, the third level sector is facing the same issues which are affecting construction developments globally, including disrupted supply chains and other constraints. Very significant progress is being made in Government's overall housing policy with both housing completions and commencements showing significant acceleration and the construction workforce back to pre-pandemic levels.  Notwithstanding positive recent trends, construction costs and other constraints are acting as a deterrent to institutions in proceeding with new developments. My Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are continuing to consider whether there are options that may be open to us to support increased supply within affordable rental levels.  </p>  <p>  With this in mind, I am working with my officials to consider immediate options and those initiatives which can be achieved in the more medium term.</p>  <p>  I have recently written to all universities, technological universities and institutes of technology asking them to identify any potential local solutions which could contribute to increased supply ahead of the next academic year. This may involve the repurposing of existing buildings.</p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to examine how student accommodation can be incorporated into other developments aimed at boosting housing supply such as the Land Development Agency's plans in Limerick. In my view student accommodation should form part of the overall residential mix. </p>  <p>  On affordability, restrictions have also been put in place to limit the amount that students can be required to pay up front for their accommodation, ending the practice whereby students were required to pay a lump sum up front each term. The total amount that anyone is required to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure a tenancy to no more than the equivalent of 2 months&rsquo; rent- that is one month&rsquo;s rent, and one month&rsquo;s deposit. In addition, student accommodation is subject to Rent Pressure Zone caps.</p>  <p>  I will bring a policy paper on student accommodation to the Housing Cabinet Committee at the beginning of April.</p></reply>

My ambition is to ensure that we provide supports and opportunities for learning to all. This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, the most marginalised and those with special and additional needs. </p>  <p>  The Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) Supporting DEIS Learners Transition to FET Steering Group was established in 2018 at policy?development?level under ETBI structures to support collaboration amongst ETBs, continually improve practice and, develop draft proposals, policies, procedures, information and resources in areas of supporting DEIS learners transition to FET. Since 2018, the Group has supported the establishment of local networks providing information and clear pathways for DEIS learners transition to FET, mapped existing local initiatives to support the Transition of DEIS Learners to FET and shared best practice, developed   a community of shared practice, facilitating learning and development and enhancing capacity within the membership and has established a communication channel facilitating the exchange of information between ETBI, ETBs, JMB and ACCS.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of the new National Access Plan (NAP) 2022 - 2026 is at an advanced stage and I will be bringing the new Plan to Government shortly. </p>  <p>  The vision of the Third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 (NAP) is that the student body entering, participating in, and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population. The plan set out five goals and more than thirty actions, developed following widespread consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of supporting increased access and participation in higher education by six main target groups.  Those groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first-time mature students, students with disabilities, part-time/flexible learners, further education and training award holders; and Irish Travellers. The plan also indicated subgroups that require support, including lone parents, teen parents and ethnic minorities. Improving equity of access to higher education is an ongoing objective. The NAP identified a number of indicators that help to inform progress on NAP implementation and the delivery of increased equity of access.  These include entry to higher education from students who have attended DEIS schools, students in receipt of the special rate of grant and data based on postcodes. </p>  <p>  At the commencement of the NAP there were 3,959 new entrants to higher education from DEIS schools. This data is recorded through the HEA Student Record System (SRS).  As we develop the new National Access Plan 2022-2026, which is currently underway, and continue to gather data on this particular group, a notable increase is evident in 2020/21, with 5,320 new entrants from DEIS schools attending higher education. This finding is in line with a Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills  (2021) report which noted an increase in the transition rates of those attending DEIS schools to higher education in 2020.  We will continue to measure entry to higher education for those attending DEIS schools over the lifetime of the new Plan.</p>  <p>  DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) Initiative is the most significant national (and centrally funded) initiative that targets support at disadvantaged communities, particularly those located in urban areas, the Departments work collaboratively to support successful educational transitions to further and higher education. Early intervention and early educational experiences are crucial &ndash; Access to further and higher education starts early, and earlier inclusive experiences of students in education is crucial influencing factor.</p>  <p>  Engagement with DEIS schools also features in Strand 3 of the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH). PATH 3 supports HEI capacity in developing regional and community partnership strategies (including with DEIS schools) for increasing access to higher education by specified groups. A number of projects approved under PATH 3, including under the recent extension of a funding for another three years, include engagement with local DEIS schools. </p>  <p>  Similarly, a number of projects supported under Strand 1 of PATH, which is committed to increasing the diversity of initial teacher education for new entrants, involve engagement with DEIS schools. For example, several Centres collaborate with DEIS schools in mentoring programmes to improve the reach of access to higher education and in particular, access to initial teacher education. </p>  <p>  In addition, the PATH 2 bursaries now with three tiers of support take a wider range of indicators into consideration and students from DEIS schools can feature among the recipients.  </p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to seven Special Disadvantage Initiatives located in areas of socio-economic disadvantage in Dublin and Limerick cities. These projects specifically target children and young people in primary and post primary DEIS schools who are generally at risk of not reaching their full academic potential. They also seek to direct further targeted activities at children and young people who demonstrate high academic potential but may be at risk of not progressing to further or higher education for a variety of reasons. </p></reply>

Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic: Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding, Supply Chain Associate. A further three programmes are close to launch: Wind Turbine Maintenance, Bar Manager, Transport Operations and Commercial Driving.</p>  <p>  There are 17 additional programmes being developed across agriculture, construction, engineering, equine, finance, horticulture, hospitality and food, ICT and logistics. A number of other potential apprenticeships are at an exploratory stage, in sectors such as health, beauty, environmental, engineering, ICT and finance.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;34 million was provided in Budget 2022 to expand apprenticeship, including the development of new programmes noted above. The funding was also allocated to address the Covid-related backlogs on off-the-job training placements for craft apprentices, to establish the National Apprenticeship Office which will operationalise the new system, and funding to introduce a new employer grant. This grant of &euro;2,000 per eligible apprentice is designed to encourage more employers to engage with a wider range of apprenticeships and to help encourage the development of new programmes. It also means that, for the first time, all employers will receive a level of support towards the cost of apprentice training.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan sets a target of 10,000 annual apprentice registrations by 2025. In 2021 there were a record 8,607 registrations- up from 6,177 for 2019, the last pre-COVID full year, and the highest annual registrations since the 2006 figure of 8,306, showing the high degree of interest in this career option amongst both employers and potential apprentices. At the end of 2021, the overall apprentice population was 24,212.</p>  <p>  The increase in registrations, despite the pandemic, provides us with a solid pipeline of new talent coming through the apprenticeship system and highlights the huge interest in this area of training. The measures I have outlined above, combined with other deliverables in the Action Plan, mean that the funding allocated n Budget 2022 will support further progress towards achieving the vision articulated in the Plan. </p></reply>

Our higher education institutions have a duty of care to their students and staff, and a responsibility to foster a campus culture that is clear in the condemnation of unwanted and unacceptable behaviours, which act as barriers to their safety and their active participation in college life. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made regarding the Framework for Consent in Higher Education, since it was first launched in 2019. The Framework aims to ensure the creation of an institutional campus culture which is safe, respectful and supportive. </p>  <p>  In August 2020, I wrote to all the Presidents of the publicly funded higher education institutions, with a view to strengthening institutional action in the area of consent. Institutions were requested to produce individual action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment and to submit these to the HEA Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality, whose responsibilities have been expanded to cover all areas of equality, diversity and inclusion, as well as oversight of the implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs.</p>  <p>  As part of monitoring requirements moving forward, the HEA requires that institutions, in respect of both staff and students, report progress annually on implementation of the Framework for Consent. </p>  <p>  My Department has provided support for a number of consent awareness raising and training initiatives in the HEIs, including the:</p>  <p>  -  NUIG Active Consent Programme</p>  <p>  -  UCC Bystander Training</p>  <p>  -  Speak Out report and support online platform</p>  <p>  -  The ESHTE Toolkit and It Stops Now Campaign led by the NWC in conjunction with USI.</p>  <p>  My Department is partnering with the Department of Justice and the NUIG Active Consent programme to support the an online hub that will provide, for the first time, an integrated, publicly available resource on sexual consent awareness and learning, which is an important resource for our further and higher education institutions and the wider community.</p>  <p>  The IUA has published guidelines entitled 'Guidelines for Universities on How to Respond to Alleged Staff or Student of University Related Sexual Misconduct', which are available to assist HEIs in this area.</p>  <p>  THEA launched their PROPEL Report (Promoting Consent and Preventing Sexual Violence), in March 2021, with funding from my Department.  The PROPEL report details key components and options for inclusion in institutional action plans, outline of best practice and guidelines for emerging policies and procedures in this area and a series of conclusions and recommendations.</p>  <p>  With regard to the recently published surveys of student and staff experiences of sexual violence and harassment in higher education, I want to take this opportunity to thank students and staff across the country who took the time to engage with this survey and share their experiences with us. A total of 11,417 responses were analysed (7,901 students and 3,516 staff) and inform the findings.</p>  <p>  The survey findings point to some positive developments in the higher education institutions that can be built upon in areas such as awareness raising and education. But there are also some deeply troubling findings, such as the levels of sexual harassment experienced by staff and students that responded to the survey and particularly the female students that reported that they had experienced sexual violence. </p>  <p>  An Expert Advisory Group chaired by the HEA is currently reviewing the survey reports and will be submitting proposed actions shortly which will complement the work already underway on the Consent Framework in the higher education sector.</p>  <p>  I will continue to lead the way on institutional change, championing the changes required to achieve a cultural norm where bullying and sexual harassment are not tolerated.</p>  <p>  Since 2019, around &euro;1m has been allocated to support projects in this area. </p>  <p>  Funding is provided to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) - Centre of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, for oversight of work in this area, as part of the HEA grant allocation. My Department has also collaborated with the Department of Justice on a dormant accounts funded project for the NUIG Active Consent programme in 2022. The Department of Justice has secured &euro;189,000 in dormant accounts funding for this project in 2022.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022, &euro;300,000 additional funding was secured to support sectoral sexual consent  related initiatives. This will be allocated by the HEA. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-03-08a.83.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030800067#WRC07400"><p>My objective as Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, is to ensure that there is access into either further or higher education for each person who wishes to pursue educational options at third-level. Access to higher education in Ireland is very open by international standards, with our population of 25-34 year-olds having the highest level of higher education qualifications in Europe.</p>  <p>  While I aim to ensure that learners are given the opportunity to access the courses that interest them, there are real, material limits on the number of students that can be accommodated in some courses. In particular, courses with significant practical or laboratory elements, courses which require work placements and courses which must satisfy specific requirements from professional bodies all face specific challenges when it comes to any increase in intake.  Expansion of higher education must also take into account issues around sufficient classroom space and the staff to student ratio, as well as the importance of maintaining a balance within third level between further education, higher education and apprenticeship.</p>  <p>  In light of the limits on the number of places, admissions criteria are necessary. Many students currently enter on the basis of CAO points calculated based on the Leaving Certificate or other post-primary qualifications. However there are a range of other pathways into higher education such as mature entry, further to higher education pathways, and access programmes. Admissions criteria for higher education are determined by the higher education institutions, in line with their autonomy.</p>  <p>  It is  important to emphasise that while the Leaving Certificate is used by some students as the basis of a CAO application, it is not an entrance examination for higher education. The primary function of the Leaving Certificate is as the terminal exam of post-primary education, and it can be used to pursue other options such as training, apprenticeships and employment.</p>  <p>  There is a diverse range of pathways in further and higher education that meet both individual and wider educational and skills needs.  In my role as Minister for Further and Higher Education, it has, therefore, been a priority for me to highlight and communicate the need for a balanced tertiary education system.  To progress this key goal, from this year, school leavers will be able to explore options across the third level system, whether in higher education, further education or apprenticeship options, from the CAO website.  </p>  <p>  My Department already contributes significantly towards the fees for undergraduate degrees. Under my Department&rsquo;s free fees schemes, the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate higher education students. All students eligible for the scheme receive state support whereby the Exchequer pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution (&euro;3,000). The Exchequer pays the student contribution (in full or part) on behalf of students who qualify under the student grant scheme for approximately 45% of Free Fee Eligible students. The fee payable by a student can vary depending on a variety factors including the type of course and the student's access route including previous education.</p>  <p>  Where students do not qualify for free fees funding, they must pay the appropriate fee as determined by each higher education institution.</p>  <p>  I am highly conscious of the challenges posed by the increased cost of living. As part of Budget 2022, I have secured an additional &euro;15m to enhance the existing financial supports under the Student Grant Scheme for implementation in 2022. This will mean:</p>  <p>  -  An increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit allstudents entitled to receive a maintenance Grant. There are currently circa 62,000 SUSI grant recipients receiving maintenance support.</p>  <p>  -  The income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant has been increased by &euro;1,000.</p>  <p>  -  The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km, effective from the start of the 2022/23 academic year.</p></reply>

More specifically, they include housing and retrofitting related programmes such as electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery, plastering, painting and decorating and the recently launched scaffolding apprenticeship. Curricula in existing apprenticeships are updated on an ongoing basis to keep pace with changes in industry practices and regulations. </p>  <p>  In relation to a retrofit apprenticeship programme, it is worth noting that modelling in the EGFSN report &lsquo;Skills for a Zero Carbon Economy&rsquo; regarding retrofit breaks down the labour and skills demand by retrofit job type. Insulation and airtightness works are the largest category, followed by cosmetic and repair works, such as plastering, painting, and replacing flooring, whilst other significant jobs include lighting and electrics, heating, and engineering and support services. Recognising the diversity of skills required for retrofit, it is considered that the current training options available offer a more agile way of meeting labour and skills needs, with several relevant apprenticeship programmes available in this regard.   </p>  <p>  General provision in areas such as green skills and sustainability, which includes retrofit and Near Zero Energy Building (NZEB), is ongoing across the FET sector, with some 50+ programmes already running across the sector. NZEB skills training comprising one to four days of training is largely targeted to existing construction professionals. Ongoing innovation in delivery includes a move to a blended model of training in addition to the development of a pilot VR programme which is expected to be operational by year end.  </p>  <p>  At non-craft operative level there is a Skills to Advance programme in Thermal Insulation Installation. Follow-on modules in Ventilation and Air Tightness will be offered to all participants of the Thermal Insulation Programme.</p>  <p>  SOLAS&rsquo;s Green Skills for FET Roadmap 2021-2030 will build on this progress when it is launched 23rd March. It will set out the FET requirements to meet the Climate Action Plan 2021, Skills for Zero Carbon 2021, and similar government policies/plans. It incorporates the National Recovery and Resilience Plan Green Skills Action Programme which began in 2021. The NRRP has committed &euro;29M to NZEB &amp;amp; Retrofit upskilling and reskilling programmes and &euro;10M to Green Skills Modules. Under the Plan, 4,550 retrofit and NZEB standard places and 60,000 green skills places are to be provided by the end of 2022. </p>  <p>  In the Higher Education sector, supplementing core education delivery, funding is provided under Springboard and the Human Capital Initiative to incentivise the delivery of programmes which support the development of professionals in areas such as building analysis and climate adaptation; sustainable building technology and retrofit, conservation and sustainability.</p></reply>

In 2021 there were a record 8,607 registrations- up from 6,177 for 2019, the last pre-COVID full year, and the highest annual registrations since the 2006 figure of 8,306. This shows the high degree of interest in this career option amongst both employers and potential apprentices.</p>  <p>  There are currently 62 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 37 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic; Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding , Supply Chain Associate. Several other programmes are close to launch including Wind Turbine Maintenance, Transport Operations, and Commercial Driving.</p>  <p>  There are 17 additional programmes being developed across agriculture, construction, engineering, equine, finance, horticulture, hospitality and food, ICT and logistics. A number of other potential apprenticeships are at an exploratory stage, in sectors such as health, beauty, environmental, engineering, ICT and finance.</p>  <p>  The Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board (LCETB), deliver training for phase 2 in Wood Manufacturing &amp;amp; Finishing, Electrical Instrumentation, Metal Fabrication, Plumbing, M.A.MF., Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, Toolmaking, Carpentry &amp;amp; Joinery, Motor Mechanics, Electrical, Aircraft Mechanics.</p>  <p>  The Technological University of the Shannon &ndash; Moylish Campus Limerick delivers training for phases 4 and 6 in M.A.MF, Carpentry &amp;amp; Joinery, Motor Mechanics, Electrical.</p>  <p>  Details of consortia-led apprenticeships delivered in Limerick along with further details of all apprenticeship programmes available as of Oct 2021 can be found in the attached document.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan also sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship accessible to employers and learners. </p>  <p>  The Plan will address the clear need to broaden the awareness of apprenticeship as a work-based route to internationally recognised qualifications and experience for people of all ages, be they progressing in their career, school leavers, career changers, or the unemployed. Growing that message is a key feature of planning for apprenticeship in the coming years. </p>  <p>  By the end of 2021 31% of the overall apprenticeship population were over 25 years of age. In a number of recently developed apprenticeships such as CGI Technical Assistant, Equipment Systems Engineer, and Principal Engineer, the over 25 cohort rises to 100%. Across all of the 37 more recently developed apprenticeships the average age of apprentices is 27.</p>  <p>  A new National Apprenticeship Office (NAO) will make accessing information on, and engagement with, apprenticeship more straightforward for both learners of all ages and employers. In 2022 the public service will set out a roadmap for the recruitment of apprentices and a new Apprenticeship Employer Grant of &euro;2,000 per annum has been launched for employers of consortia-led apprenticeships. This will encourage more employers to engage with a wider range of apprenticeships and apprentices and help to encourage the development of new programmes. It also means that, for the first time, all employers will receive a level of support towards the cost of apprentice training.</p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan the impacts of, and outcomes from, existing access to apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programmes as well as other interventions across the sector will be examined to provide an evidence base for best practice and future interventions to deliver an apprentice population which better reflects the general population.  Enhanced cooperation with the State's Public Employment Service as set out in the Plan will also increase visibility of apprenticeship to employers and career changers.</p>  <p>  Skills for a New Generation is a 2022 online showcase of inspiring apprenticeship experiences, with information on all national apprenticeships. The showcase, which includes 10 individual short videos, includes advice from apprentices of all ages and backgrounds, former apprentices, tutors, and industry leaders can be accessed on www.apprenticeship.ie.</p>  <p>  These measures and the implementation process for the Action Plan for Apprenticeship overall will have a significant impact in ensuring greater diversity in the apprenticeship population as a whole.  </p></reply>

Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the COVID-related shutdown of on-site learning activity significantly impacted their ability to access off-the-job training.</p>  <p>  In response, capital funding of &euro;20m was provided in 2020 to extend and upgrade craft apprenticeship facilities across further and higher education institutions. Additional funding of &euro;17m was provided under Budget 2022 to further facilitate the SOLAS and HEA&rsquo;s response to the backlogs. This included a significant recruitment campaign to increase the number of trainers.</p>  <p>  At the end of February 7,796 craft apprentices were waiting for access to phase 2, 4 or 6 off-the-job training. This is down from nearly 12,000 apprentices who were waiting last August.</p>  <p>  2022 will see an increase of over 3,100 off-the-job training places being made available across craft apprenticeship phases 2, 4 and 6 over 2021 scheduled numbers (pre-COVID expected provision). </p>  <p>  This additional capacity has already begun to come on-stream from September 2021 and is being delivered under a three-step response plan agreed by SOLAS, HEA and education and training providers. The immediate focus is on the three craft apprenticeships with the longest waiting lists, namely Electrical, Plumbing and Carpentry &amp;amp; Joinery.  </p>  <p>  For Phase 2, which is delivered in ETBs, a focused, time-limited response will increase the number of intakes per year from two to three. Planning is also underway for further expansion of workshops to facilitate additional classes in 2022. Phase 2 off-the-job training capacity is expected to increase to 5,390 places, with in the region of 8,800 off-the-job training places across phases 4 and 6 in 2022. </p>  <p>  All of these measures combined put us in a good position to respond to the backlog and enable apprentices affected to continue with their training in as timely a manner as possible.  </p></reply>

The Green Skills for FET Roadmap 2021-2030 will be launched 23rd March and sets out (in high-level) the FET requirements to meet the Climate Action Plan 2021, Skills for Zero Carbon 2021, and similar government policies/plans. It incorporates the National Recovery and Resilience Plan Green Skills Action Programme which began in 2021. Under the Programme, 60,000 green skills places and 4,550 retrofit and NZEB training places across a total of five centres of excellence are to be provided by the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  The expansion of Technological Universities will also develop expertise and provide opportunities for Ireland&rsquo;s future green economy.</p>  <p>  In higher education, the Human Capital Initiative (HCI) has provided significant funding for courses that include a focus on the environment, climate change and sustainability. Across HCI Pillars 1 and 2, 16 courses with a specific focus on environment/energy/sustainability/circular economy were approved, providing almost 1000 course places for learners. A number of HCI pillar 3 projects with notable components addressing climate action, environment and sustainability were awarded funding and will have wide-reaching impacts, given the multi-partner collaborative approach adopted in many instances. A number of Springboard+ courses also have a focus on environment and sustainability matters. </p>  <p>  In April, Minister Foley and I announced a public consultation on the development of the second National Strategy on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). The strategy will be aligned with UNESCO&rsquo;s Framework to 2030 and SDG 4.7, which aims that:</p>  <p>  &ldquo;By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture&rsquo;s contribution to sustainable development&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Further embedding ESD in curricula and programmes at all levels will be a key focus area in the strategy to support this. It is expected that the new strategy for ESD to 2030 will be published later in Spring 2022. </p></reply>

This is essential in ensuring that our higher education institutions can effectively meet high standards of quality and achieve critical outcomes for our economy and society.</p>  <p>  The Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions. Funding is distributed via the Recurrent Grant Allocation Model (RGAM) which utilises a 'two pot' system.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the Higher Education Authority (HEA) appointed an independent Expert Panel to review the current allocation model for funding higher education and to make recommendations on the most appropriate funding model for the future. The completed review recommends reforms to the HEA funding distribution model. A key recommendation was that (in principle) the future funding model should adopt a universal approach to supporting all higher education institutions facilitated by the development of a Costing Model applied consistently across Higher Education Institutes.</p>  <p>  The implementation of a reformed allocation model is dependent on implementation of a sustainable funding model.</p>  <p>  I will be bringing forward a proposal on a funding model to Government, which will be implemented as part of forthcoming Budgets. Implementation will entail the sector delivering strengthened performance and enhanced outcomes, based on a robust reform agenda.</p>  <p>  This approach will be informed by the comprehensive economic evaluation of funding options which has been carried out under the auspices of the European Commission's Structural Reform Support Programme.</p>  <p>  I brought this matter to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery shortly before Christmas. This allowed the key issues to be explored. It was agreed that both I and my Department would engage with Minister McGrath and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to inform Government's consideration, in particular undertaking technical work to update costings reflecting relevant funding decisions in Budget 2022 and other issues, which is nearing finalisation. This work has sought to robustly assess the assumptions underpinning the economic evaluation and to take account of the significant levels of State funding which have been invested in higher education and student support in recent years.</p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s my intention to bring final proposals for funding and reform of higher education arising from this work to Government very shortly. I am very clear that, from a policy perspective, addressing the sustainability of the higher education system must proceed in tandem with measures which address the costs of education as a barrier to accessing higher education.  We need to focus on both if we want a system that can be accessed by everyone and that can deliver the talent and skills that our country needs.  With that in mind, I will also be bringing the review of the Student Grant Scheme to Government at the same time.</p>  <p>  The new funding and reform framework will be provided to the Oireachtas Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, following Cabinet consideration and will be published along with the DG Reform sponsored economic assessment report on sustainability of higher education and the SUSI review.</p>  <p>  There have been many reports on Higher Education Funding over the last number of years, and my goal is not simply to publish the economic assessment but for Government to make big decisions that will allow for a multi-annual, inclusive process implementation process to commence. The implementation process will allow for important input from stakeholders and provide much needed momentum on the implementation of key decisions that will guide funding and reform of the Higher Education sector in the years ahead.</p></reply>

It is open to any industry that wishes to explore such options to bring forward a proposal. Applications for new apprenticeship development are open on an ongoing basis, allowing all employers to progress the development of programmes in response to emerging skills needs on an as-needed basis.</p>  <p>  Expanding apprenticeship across all sectors of the economy has widened its impact in areas of skills shortage such as Engineering, Technology Skills, Logistics and FinTech. </p>  <p>  There are currently 62 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 37 programmes introduced since 2016. Despite the pandemic, eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021: Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding, and Supply Chain Associate. </p>  <p>  A further three programmes progressed during this time and are close to launch: Wind Turbine Maintenance, Bar Manager, Transport Operations and Commercial Driving.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are 17 additional programmes being developed across agriculture, construction, engineering, equine, finance, horticulture, hospitality and food, ICT and logistics. A number of other potential apprenticeships are at an exploratory stage, in sectors such as health, beauty, environmental, engineering, ICT and finance.  </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 sets out new ways of structuring, funding, and promoting apprenticeships to make apprenticeship more accessible to employers and learners, to achieve a target of 10,000 annual registrations across a wide range of programmes by 2025. </p>  <p>  Meeting these targets requires an apprenticeship system that is flexible and responsive, provides a strong value proposition for employers and potential apprentices, is attractive and easy to engage with, and which delivers high standards and sought after qualifications.</p>  <p>  We have made important progress to date. Last year saw a record 8,607 registrations- up from 6,177 for 2019, the last pre-COVID full year, and the highest annual figure since 2006, which saw 8,306 registrations. This is a strong foundation on which to build as we advance delivery of the Action Plan, in order to embedding apprenticeship as a preferred route to skills development.</p></reply>

The scheme has seen some of Ireland&rsquo;s most prominent researchers &lsquo;shadowing&rsquo; members of the Oireachtas for the day in Leinster House. The scheme was developed by the Irish Research Council to bridge the divide between policy-making and research and to ensure that elected representatives are supported to avail of and engage with publicly funded research.  </p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Shadowing Scheme pairs an Irish Research Council-funded researcher with a member of the Oireachtas. Typically, the researcher will be matched with a TD or Senator from his or her local constituency or who has expertise in an area of interest. The researcher accompanies the TD or Senator to Leinster House on the agreed date, observes proceedings and shadows their work for the day. The scheme is an excellent opportunity for researchers to deepen their understanding of political engagement and the policy-making system &ndash; and for members of the Oireachtas to engage directly with publicly-funded researchers. Members are welcome to do a return visit to the researcher&rsquo;s institution, if they wish.  </p>  <p>  The scheme was due to run again in 2020 but was paused as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Irish Research Council is looking into future pairing as social distancing measures ease. The next pairings will expand to include Irish members of the European Parliament and initial contacts have already taken place with selected MEPs. </p>  <p>  In 2019 Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) launched a pilot programme which is designed to attain the objectives referenced by the Deputy.    </p>  <p>  This programme offers researchers a unique opportunity to be temporarily seconded to Government Departments and Agencies to work on specific projects where they can add value resulting in mutually beneficial outcomes. The programme recognises the importance of connecting the Irish research community with public sector organisations to help inform new policy and improve the services that they deliver and contribute to solving national societal challenges.  This initiative will contribute to the Government&rsquo;s objective of promoting a culture of innovation through collaboration, knowledge exchange and the development and implementation of data-driven and evidence-based approaches, as outlined in Our Public Service 2020.</p>  <p>  Following the Public Service Fellowship programme pilot, SFI is exploring options to re-launch this important initiative, subject to budget availability.</p>  <p>  A total of 12 Public Service Fellowships were awarded with placements in a number of hosts: Houses of the Oireachtas Library and Research Services (6 Fellows), the Department of Children, Disability, Equality and Integration (1 Fellow), Food Safety Authority of Ireland (2 Fellows), The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (2 Fellows) and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (1 Fellow). Of the 12 Fellowships, 7 were due to end their placement in 2021. The remaining Fellows will carry out their placements until 2023.</p>  <p>  It has become very clear the essential input, expertise and service that the academic research community can provide to bolster colleagues in Government Departments and agencies.</p>  <p>  Equally, placements within Government Departments and agencies will expose academic researchers to the mechanics of public service and policy making which will contribute greatly to their career development. The secondment model will also provide an opportunity for further dissemination of knowledge and learnings to a broader academic cohort on return of the Fellow to their academic institution. Thus, the SFI Public Service Fellowship pilot programme will help in increasing the linkages between the research and civil service systems.</p>  <p>  In addition my Department initiated the Creating our Future campaign - our national conversation on the role research can and should play in addressing opportunities, challenges and hopes for the future. I am pleased to say that over eighteen thousand submissions were received. </p>  <p>  I also recently announced plans to decouple the Chief Science Advisor role from the role of the Director General of Science Foundation Ireland in the medium term. In August, my Department initiated informal discussions with stakeholders on the provision of science advice. My Department will present a formal consultation document and commence a public consultation, in Q2 2022, on the provision of science advice to identify the best model for Ireland. The Department will work together with other Departments and also take advice from the European Commission, OECD and other international experts in formulating detailed proposals. </p></reply>

The Convention seeks to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity. </p><p>Inclusion is one of the core strategic goals for my Department, and my ambition is to ensure that we provide supports and opportunities for learning to all. This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, people who are most marginalised and people with special and additional needs. </p><p>The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities are the two key policy leavers operating across Government. My department is represented on the steering committees of both strategies to ensure that the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland are progressively realised. </p><p>My department has recently published a number of policy documents which articulate policy responses for key groups, including persons with disabilities. The Further Education and Training Strategy 2020-2024 includes plans to target priority groups who have diverse needs, such as people with disabilities. The 10 year Adult Literacy for Life Strategy (2021-30), which was launched last September, outlines a cross-Government approach to reduce the number of adults in Ireland who have unmet literacy, numeracy and digital skills needs. People with a disability are one of the key target groups within the strategy. </p><p>The Action Plan for Apprenticeship (2021-25) was launched in April 2021. One of the five unambiguous objectives in the plan is &lsquo;Apprenticeship for all&rsquo;, meaning that the profile of the apprenticeship population will more closely reflect the profile of the general population. The explicit &lsquo;deliverables&rsquo; underpinning this include an apprenticeship structure that is inclusive in terms of access and delivery. </p><p>I intend to publish the Strategic Action Plan for Equity, Participation and Success in Higher Education (2022-2026) in the coming weeks. The new plan<b></b>will include specific supports for persons with disabilities, including those with intellectual disabilities. </p><p>I believe that my Department can play a leading role in terms of improving opportunities for people with disabilities. My Department will continue to play its part in improving opportunities for persons with disabilities to engage in education, undertake apprenticeships and gain meaningful employment. </p></reply>

Our higher education institutions have a duty of care to their students and staff, and a responsibility to foster a campus culture that is clear in the condemnation of unwanted and unacceptable behaviours, which act as barriers to their safety and their active participation in college life. </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made regarding the Framework for Consent in Higher Education, since it was first launched in 2019. The Framework aims to ensure the creation of an institutional campus culture which is safe, respectful and supportive. </p>  <p>  In August 2020, I wrote to all the Presidents of the publicly funded higher education institutions, with a view to strengthening institutional action in the area of consent. Institutions were requested to produce individual action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment and to submit these to the HEA Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality, whose responsibilities have been expanded to cover all areas of equality, diversity and inclusion, as well as oversight of the implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs.</p>  <p>  As part of monitoring requirements moving forward, the HEA requires that institutions, in respect of both staff and students, report progress annually on implementation of the Framework for Consent. </p>  <p>  My Department has provided support for a number of consent awareness raising and training initiatives in the HEIs, including the:</p>  <p>  -  NUIG Active Consent Programme</p>  <p>  -  UCC Bystander Training</p>  <p>  -  Speak Out report and support online platform</p>  <p>  -  The ESHTE Toolkit and It Stops Now Campaign led by the NWCI in conjunction with USI.</p>  <p>  My Department is partnering with the Department of Justice and the NUIG Active Consent programme to support the development of an online hub that will provide, for the first time, an integrated, publicly available resource on sexual consent awareness and learning, which will be an important resource for our further and higher education institutions and the wider community.</p>  <p>  The IUA has published guidelines entitled 'Guidelines for Universities on How to Respond to Alleged Staff or Student of University Related Sexual Misconduct', which are available to assist HEIs in this area.</p>  <p>  THEA launched their PROPEL Report (Promoting Consent and Preventing Sexual Violence), in March 2021, with funding from my Department.  The PROPEL report details key components and options for inclusion in institutional action plans, outline of best practice and guidelines for emerging policies and procedures in this area and a series of conclusions and recommendations.</p>  <p>  With regard to the recently published surveys of student and staff experiences of sexual violence and harassment in higher education, I want to take this opportunity to thank students and staff across the country who took the time to engage with this survey and share their experiences with us. A total of 11,417 responses were analysed (7,901 students and 3,516 staff) and inform the findings.</p>  <p>  The survey findings point to some positive developments in the higher education institutions that can be built upon in areas such as awareness raising and education. But there are also some deeply troubling findings, such as the levels of sexual harassment experienced by staff and students that responded to the survey and particularly the female students that reported that they had experienced sexual violence. </p>  <p>  An Expert Advisory Group chaired by the HEA is currently reviewing the survey reports and will be submitting proposed actions shortly which will complement the work already underway on the Consent Framework in the higher education sector.</p>  <p>  I will continue to lead the way on institutional change, championing the changes required to achieve a cultural norm where bullying and sexual harassment are not tolerated.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s support for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering.</p>  <p>  However, we also recognize that the actions of the Russian state are no reflection on its people. I am determined that Russian and Ukrainian students studying in Ireland, as well as Irish students studying at third level institutions in Russia and Ukraine, are supported in these difficult times.  From my own engagement, along with that of my Department's, we have been reassured that this is the case. </p>  <p>  Futhermore, there are Irish students on mobilities under the Erasmus programme in Moscow State University, and should any of these students wish to return to Ireland, the EU Commission have indicated that additional costs may be met under its 'force majeure' clauses.  </p>  <p>  I am also aware of a group of over 30 Irish students who were studying Medicine and Dentistry in Ukraine whose studies have been disrupted as a result of the invasion. My Department is in contact with them with a view to, in the first instance, ascertaining their safety, and to see how they can be supported in continuing with their studies. A key element of this is to align the students&rsquo; programme with the Irish system of medical/ dentistry education. In this regard my Department is currently engaged with the Irish Universities Association (IUA). </p>  <p>  I recently met with Commissioner Mariya Gabriel, who has responsibility for innovation, research, culture, education and youth when inter alia we discussed the situation in Ukraine.  We agreed that it is essential that access to education is maintained, and I confirmed to the Commissioner that Ireland is ready to support any actions proposed by the Commission to make sure that remains the case.</p></reply>

My Department is committed to the continued roll-out of supports and targeted initiatives in 2022 to tackle educational disadvantage and support equity of access, participation and success in both further and higher education.  </p><p>The main support available to assist postgraduate students with the cost of attending higher education is the Student Grant Scheme. The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p><p>Under the Student Grant Scheme 2021, a student in receipt of a postgraduate research award where the stipend portion of the award does not exceed &euro;18,500 may apply to the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) for financial assistance.  </p><p>Postgraduate students who meet all of the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;5,915 in 2021/22. The income threshold for this grant for the 2021/22 academic year is &euro;24,500 with a qualifying social welfare payment. Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270.  One Parent Family Payment is a qualifying payment for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme. One Parent Family Payments (Means Tested) (where paid to the applicant) is also listed as an income disregard under the Scheme i.e. not counted as reckonable income for the student grant means test.</p><p>Alternatively a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;3,500 contribution made towards the cost of his/her fees. The income threshold for this payment is up to &euro;54,240 for the 2021/22 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents.  </p><p>Budget 2021 provided for enhanced postgraduate supports for the academic year 2021/22 including the fee grant amount rising from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500 and the income threshold for eligibility for these grants to increase from &euro;31,500, now &euro;54,240. This was an initial step in meeting part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding SUSI grant support.</p><p>In addition to this measure in Budget 2022 I secured &euro;15m to enhance student supports which includes the special rate of grant payment being increased by &euro;200 (along with all other maintenance grant rates) for the 2022/23 academic year. The special rate of grant will be payable at the non-adjacent rate of &euro;6,115 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,575, depending on the distance from ordinary residence to the college attended.  </p><p>Students can determine their eligibility at . The student may also wish to discuss his eligibility for SUSI assistance by calling the SUSI Support Desk on 0818 888 777.</p><p>The vision of the Third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 is that the student body entering, participating in, and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population. The plan set out five goals and more than thirty actions, developed following widespread consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of supporting increased access and participation in higher education by six main target groups.  Those groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first-time mature students, students with disabilities, part-time/flexible learners, further education and training award holders; and Irish Travellers. The plan also indicated subgroups that require support, including lone parents, teen parents and ethnic minorities. Improving equity of access to higher education is an ongoing objective. </p><p>Lone parents are a sub-group of the target groups within National Access Plan (NAP), 2015-2021. Since 2017, following an independent review of the barriers facing lone parents in accessing higher education and other reviews of the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) and Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD), the Government has invested &euro;3 million from 2017 to 2019 which enabled the extension of the SAF to part-time students who are lone parents or other members of National Access Plan target groups. </p><p>It is a condition that at least 20% of the PATH 2 1916 Bursaries should be allocated to Lone Parents.  I can say that over the four years this fund is in existence this target has been achieved, and actually exceeded.In 2020/2021 25% of bursaries went to Lone Parents.</p><p>In 2018/19 830 students who are lone parents received funding under the SAF (725 full-time) and 105 (part-time).</p><p>My Department is committed to the continued the roll-out of supports for students and targeted initiatives to support delivery of the vision and targets within the National Access Plan.  </p><p>Work on developing the new National Access Plan 2022 &ndash; 2026 is underway.  Colleagues in my Department are working closely with the Higher Education Authority in developing up priority actions and new target groups for the next National Access Plan.I am looking forward to publishing this new and exciting Plan this year. We hope to have a more student centred plan that drives our strategic goal of inclusion which is a cornerstone of my Department priorities. Our new plan which is at an advanced stage of preparation will have an increased focus on student success.</p><p>I secured an additional &euro;5m in budget 2022 to bring forward targeted measures to support the implementation of this plan when it is published.</p><p>As part of the package of COVID19 supports for 2020 and 2021 the level of baseline core funding was doubled by providing an additional &euro;8.1m in each of those two years.</p><p>Also in 2021 an additional &euro;1.3m was allocated to the Fund (as a result of underspends in SUSI) to meet the additional demands identified by the Higher Education Institutions arising from COVID19.</p><p>The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.  </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>. </p><p>Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including for those heading one-parent families. FET provision is largely free or heavily subsidised, and a number of financial supports may be available to learners to facilitate the participation of individuals who would not otherwise be in a position to take up training. I would encourage people to make an appointment with their local Adult Education Guidance Service (AEGS), available in each Education and Training Boards (ETB) across the country free of charge, to discuss what supports may be available to them.</p></reply>

As of January 2022 (the latest full month figures available), there have been 524 apprenticeship registrations, with 376 of these on construction-related programmes.</p><p>A number of local authorities throughout the country employ apprentices, with in the region of 50 apprentices currently employed by these bodies. The majority of the apprentices are employed in craft trades such as plumbing, carpentry and joinery, and electrical.</p><p>A key commitment of the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025 is to grow the number of apprenticeship registrations across the public service, including local authorities, to reach 750 annual registrations by 2025.</p><p>Department officials have undertaken a numbers of actions in order to make progress towards achieving this commitment:<ol type="1"><li>A number of general and sector-focussed information sessions on apprenticeship were held, including one for local authorities.</li><li>A Working Group has been established, representing Government Departments and local authorities, to develop a Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan by summer 2022.</li><li>More specifically, there has been extensive bilateral engagement with the LGMA, to assist with surveying local authorities in relation to their skills needs.</li></ol>A public service wide skills survey is currently underway through the auspices of the Working Group. The survey results will inform the development of the Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan, with the content, level, and duration of public service apprenticeships determined by these identified skills needs.</p></reply>

My Department incentivises the creation of courses and places in ideas of identified skills need through initiative such as Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative (HCI). In the 2021/22 academic year there were 13,444 places provided under Springboard+ and the HCI in a range of key skills areas including hospitality and tourism.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently working with the Higher Education Authority and with the higher education sector to examine where additional undergraduate places can and should be provided in the higher education system for the next academic year. Any additional places created this year will be targeted at areas of acute skills need as identified through our national skills architecture. The introduction of additional places should also be sustainable and aligned with medium term planning. There are challenges in expanding the facilities, lecturing expertise and clinical and other placements associated with particular courses and, to the extent that these can be overcome, sustainable approaches are required.</p></reply>

The purpose of the FSD is to provide resources to further and higher education institutions for the delivery of key services and supports for students with disabilities on full-time and part-time courses. The FSD aims to support the personal, educational and professional development of the participating student and contribute to the achievement of their full potential. The FSD operates within the context of the wider education policy landscape in Ireland, which emphasises the importance of the system being one in which students of all backgrounds can succeed within the mainstream, including those with disabilities. The FSD is designed to complement, rather than substitute for, the core system.</p><p>The annual allocation to the fund is &euro;9.6m for both Further and Higher Education. In 2019/2020, circa 16,500 students were supported through the fund.</p><p>Funding can be used to provide supports and accommodations in any of the following broad categories: </p><p>-  assistive technology equipment and software (including student training)</p><p>-  non-medical helpers (e.g. personal assistants, notetakers)</p><p>-  academic/learning support</p><p>-  deaf supports (e.g. sign language interpreters, SpeedText)</p><p>-  transport support</p><p>The funding allocation for the Higher Education sector amounts to &euro;7.658m annually.</p><p>The number of students in receipt of supports funded under FSD in Higher Education by Disability Category has increased significantly over the period  2017/18, 2018/19 and 2019/20.  The table below shows that the total number of students supported between 2017/2018 and 2019/2020 increased from 11,773 to 14,358.  This represents an increase of 2,585 students or 22%.</p><p>The table below refers to primary disability only.

Under the Plan there will be an increase in online visibility of apprenticeship engagement and apprenticeship development processes for employers/sectors who wish to assess the potential for new apprenticeship development. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan sets a target of 10,000 annual apprentice registrations by 2025. In 2021 there were a record 8,607 registrations- up from 6,177 for 2019, the last pre-COVID full year, and the highest annual registrations since the 2006 figure of 8,306, showing the high degree of interest in this career option amongst both employers and potential apprentices.</p>  <p>  In 2021, 6,955 registrations were in craft apprenticeships, and largely in the construction sector, which will be vital for realising the ambition set out in Housing for All. There were 1,652 registrations on the newer, post-2016 programmes. At the end of 2021, the overall apprentice population was 24,212.</p>  <p>  There are currently 62 apprenticeship programmes on offer: 25 craft programmes and 37 programmes introduced since 2016. Eight new programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic; Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding , Supply Chain Associate. A further three programmes are close to launch; Wind Turbine Maintenance, Bar Manager, Transport Operations and Commercial Driving.</p>  <p>  There are 17 additional programmes being developed across agriculture, construction, engineering, equine, finance, horticulture, hospitality and food, ICT and logistics. A number of other potential apprenticeships are at an exploratory stage, in sectors such as health, beauty, environmental, engineering, ICT and finance.</p>  <p>  Key to the delivery of the ambition set out in the Action Plan is a new organisational architecture, involving a National Apprenticeship Office (NAO) and National Apprenticeship Alliance (NAA). The Office will have responsibility for all aspects of the management, oversight and development of the apprenticeship system and for implementing the Action Plan. Under the Action Plan the NAO will exercise on a shared and conjoint basis the relevant functions of SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority (HEA). </p>  <p>  The new National Apprenticeship Office will deliver additional practical supports and information for employers and apprentices seeking to engage with apprenticeship. Dr Mary-Liz Trant, who has extensive experience in education and training, has been appointed as the first Director of the Office. </p>  <p>  The NAO Director is currently providing the leadership required to address the next stage of the NAO&rsquo;s development, including finalising a work programme for 2022, staffing allocations and the development and implementation of solid governance and financial arrangements, aligned with the Action Plan. This is being done in consultation with SOLAS, the HEA, my Department and other key partners and &euro;1 million has been allocated in Budget 2022 for the first year of the NAO&rsquo;s operation.</p></reply>

The new Employer Grant is funded in Budget 2022 and will see annual payments to employers of &euro;2,000 per apprentice for those apprenticeships which are not eligible for the payment of off-the-job training allowances. Its introduction means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices will now have access to some level of financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through the employer grant. The grant is effective from January 2022 with operational arrangements being finalised by the Department and SOLAS. </p><p>The grant will be paid for each eligible apprentice for the duration of their apprenticeship with the parent company. This includes apprentices who were registered 2019-2021 and who continue in employment as of 1<sup>st</sup>January 2022. Two payment points are planned per year; June and December.</p><p>Eligible employers do not need to do anything as they will be contacted by the National Apprenticeship Office in May/June and invited to submit their claim online. Further details can be found on www.apprenticeship.ie</p><p>New apprenticeships introduced in 2022 and subsequent years will also be included in the grant scheme.</p></reply>

That is why Government launched Housing for All led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage which sets out a series of actions which will be delivered to address the housing crisis backed by a transformative budget of &euro;20 billion. </p>  <p>  Current construction costs are acting as a deterrent to institutions in proceeding with new developments. My Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are continuing to consider options that may be open to us to support increased supply within affordable rental levels. </p>  <p>  I have also written to all universities, technological universities and institutes of technology asking them to identify any potential local solutions which could contribute to increased supply ahead of the next academic year. This may involve the repurposing of existing buildings. </p>  <p>  On affordability, restrictions have also been put in place to limit the amount that students can be required to pay up front for their accommodation, ending the practice whereby students were required to pay a lump sum up front each term. The total amount that anyone is required to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure a tenancy to no more than the equivalent of 2 months&rsquo; rent - that is one month&rsquo;s rent, and one month&rsquo;s deposit. In addition, student accommodation is subject to Rent Pressure Zone caps. </p></reply>

Specifically the PfG commits to &ldquo;Ensure that every Higher Education Institution commissions a survey for all staff and students on harassment, sexual harassment, and bullying, with a view to informing their equality, diversity and inclusion action plans.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Following consultation with key stakeholders, a decision was made to undertake separate surveys on sexual violence &amp;amp; harassment and to commission distinct surveys on bullying.   </p>  <p>  In April 2021, at my request the Higher Education Authority (HEA) conducted national surveys to monitor the experiences of students and staff in relation to sexual violence and harassment in order to create a robust evidence base for further policy and funding decisions in relation to tackling sexual violence and harassment in higher education institutions (HEIs). The HEA established an expert Advisory Group on Ending Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment in HEIs in January 2021 to support this work. </p>  <p>I met with this HEA Advisory Group on 9th February 2022. I tasked them to review the surveys and to come back to me with actions as a result of the conclusions and recommendations from the surveys. I have also tasked the National Advisory Council (NAC) in the National Women&rsquo;s Council, to review the surveys and come back to me with actions based on the conclusions and recommendations from the surveys. I expect both groups to report to me shortly; so that an action plan can be developed which will complement the work already underway on the Consent Framework. </p>  <p>  My Department is also working closely with the Department of Justice on the Third National Strategy to combat Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence. The Deputy will be aware that the public consultation phase is currently underway and will remain open until March 10.  </p></reply>

This is essential in ensuring that our higher education institutions can effectively meet high standards of quality and achieve critical outcomes for our economy and society. </p>  <p>  I will be bringing forward a proposal on a funding model to Government, which will be implemented as part of forthcoming Budgets. Implementation will entail the sector delivering strengthened performance and enhanced outcomes, based on a robust reform agenda.</p>  <p>  This approach will be informed by the comprehensive economic evaluation of funding options which has been carried out under the auspices of the European Commission's Structural Reform Support Programme.</p>  <p>  I brought this matter to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery shortly before Christmas. This allowed the key issues to be explored. It was agreed that both I and my Department would engage with Minister McGrath and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to inform Government's consideration, in particular undertaking technical work to update costings reflecting relevant funding decisions in Budget 2022 and other issues, which is nearing finalisation. This work has sought to robustly assess the assumptions underpinning the economic evaluation and to take account of the significant levels of State funding which have been invested in higher education and student support in recent years.</p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s my intention to bring final proposals for funding and reform of higher education arising from this work to Government very shortly. I am very clear that, from a policy perspective, addressing the sustainability of the higher education system must proceed in tandem with measures which address the costs of education as a barrier to accessing higher education.  We need to focus on both if we want a system that can be accessed by everyone and that can deliver the talent and skills that our country needs.  With that in mind, I will also be bringing the review of the Student Grant Scheme to Government at the same time.</p>  <p>  The new funding and reform framework will be provided to the Oireachtas Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, following Cabinet consideration and will be published along with the DG Reform sponsored economic assessment report on sustainability of higher education and the SUSI review.</p>  <p>  There have been many reports on Higher Education Funding over the last number of years, and my goal is not simply to publish the economic assessment but for Government to make big decisions that will allow for a multi-annual, inclusive process implementation process to commence. The implementation process will allow for important input from stakeholders and provide much needed momentum on the overdue implementation of key decisions that will guide funding and reform of the Higher Education sector in the years ahead.</p></reply>

Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  </p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for student grants are reviewed annually by the Department and approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. All proposals made in relation to education expenditure, including student grants, are considered in the context of the annual Budget.  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I have secured an additional &euro;15m to enhance the existing financial supports under the Student Grant Scheme for implementation in 2022.</p>  <p>  For the academic year 2022/23 this will mean:-</p>  <p>  - An increase to all student grant maintenance payments, including the special rate of grant, of &euro;200 per year which will benefit all students entitled to receive a maintenance Grant. There are currently circa 62,000 SUSI grant recipients receiving maintenance support. </p>  <p>  - The income threshold to qualify for the standard rate of student grant has been increased by &euro;1,000. </p>  <p>  - The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km, effective from the start of the 2022/23 academic year.</p>  <p>  I have prioritised these changes for the 2022/23 academic year and they will benefit thousands of students building on the improvements that have already been made for postgraduate students through this year&rsquo;s student grant scheme. These improvements to the student grant scheme have been a priority for me since taking up my Ministerial appointment.</p>  <p>  I am also happy to give an update on the review of the Student Grant Scheme.  This was a very important commitment in the Programme for Government, which will help shape decision-making on how we support students over the years to come. The draft report was submitted to me in late December 2021.  Given the inter-connectivity between strategic student support issues and other reform priorities (e.g. the expansion of supports to part-time and blended learners as an enabler of lifelong learning or enhanced postgraduate supports as an enabler to equality, diversity and inclusion in the R&amp;I system), it is now my intention to bring the report to Cabinet shortly alongside the Future Funding Model report.</p>  <p>  The vision of the Third National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 is that the student body entering, participating in, and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population. The plan set out five goals and more than thirty actions, developed following widespread consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of supporting increased access and participation in higher education by six main target groups.  Those groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first-time mature students, students with disabilities, part-time/flexible learners, further education and training award holders; and Irish Travellers. The plan also indicated subgroups that require support, including lone parents, teen parents and ethnic minorities. Improving equity of access to higher education is an ongoing objective. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to the continued roll-out of supports for students and targeted initiatives to support delivery of the vision and targets within the National Access Plan.  </p>  <p>  Work on developing the new National Access Plan 2022 &ndash; 2026 is underway.  Colleagues in my Department are working closely with the Higher Education Authority in developing priority actions and new target groups for the next National Access Plan.   I am looking forward to publishing this new and exciting Plan this year. We hope to have a more student centred plan that drives our strategic goal of inclusion which is a cornerstone of my Department priorities. Our new plan which is at an advanced stage of preparation will have an increased focus on student success.</p>  <p>  I secured an additional &euro;5m in budget 2022 to bring forward targeted measures to support the implementation of this plan when it is published.</p>  <p>  The objectives of the National Access Plan are supported by a range of interventions and programmes:</p>  <p>  The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) which comprises dedicated funding to support access to higher education and consists of three strands focussed on increasing the participation of under-represented groups in higher education. The PATH fund has a current investment envelope of &euro;42 million over the period 2016 to 2022, across the three strands which are currently supporting access to initial teacher education from the target groups identified in the National Access Plan (Strand 1), providing a three-tiered bursary system (Strand 2) to students who have been identified by their higher education institution, approved for PATH 2 funding, as being the most socio-economically disadvantaged students in the target groups under the National Access Plan, and supports regional clusters of higher education institutions with the aim of attracting additional students from groups currently under-represented in higher education (Strand 3).  </p>  <p>  The full impact of PATH investment will be seen over the lifetime of this and subsequent national access strategies.  </p>  <p>  Students in higher education institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The annual Fund of &euro;9.1m provides financial support to students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending college. Students can apply for SAF to help with either temporary or ongoing financial difficulties and can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs, medical costs and books/class materials. It is open to both full and part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification. </p>  <p>  It is recognised that COVID19 has had a major impact on the financial situation of students and their families.  As part of my Department&rsquo;s response to the issues affecting students arising from the pandemic, I have allocated significantly higher amounts to the Fund over the past two academic years.  For 2020 and 2021 I doubled the level of baseline core funding for the SAF by providing an additional &euro;8.1m in each of those two years.</p>  <p>  Also in 2021 an additional &euro;1.3m was allocated to the Fund to meet the additional demands identified by the Higher Education Institutions arising from COVID19. </p>  <p>  In total, &euro;18.5 million was allocated for the 2021/2022 academic year.  In addition to this I also made available &euro;1.9 million in Covid-19 funding to a contingency fund for HEIs to provide additional resources to access and support services to respond to the emerging needs of the COVID pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Increasing Traveller Participation in Higher Education 2019-2021 was launched in 2019 and its aim is to advance Traveller participation in higher education within the context of approaches on retention and transition of Travellers across the education spectrum.</p>  <p>  In 2021, I secured ring-fenced funding of &euro;300,000 for targeted supports to address the implications of COVID-19 for Traveller transfer to and progression within higher education. The funding will help ensure expected increases in Traveller participation in higher education remain on track.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to announce an increase in funding for 2022, &euro;450,000 has been secured which will help to safeguard the increases already seen in participation in higher education by marginalised communities and to mitigate against the risk of long-term damage arising from COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The additional funding means that institutions can now broaden their reach to assist members of the Roma community and to do so in a community-led way.</p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education. &euro;9.6m is allocated to the Fund annually for both Further and Higher Education.  In 2019/2020, circa 16,000 students were supported through the fund.</p>  <p>  In January 2021, I approved a number of strategic projects under the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. The initiatives, which involve 24 higher education institutions (HEI) and &euro;5.8m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development. Among the projects are a number of projects for students with autism including the establishment of autism friendly rooms across nine different campuses, the development of assistive technology including for students with disabilities, an app to help students with visual or hearing impairment navigate their way around campus and specialist assistance for students who are deaf.</p>  <p>  A study commissioned by the Higher Education Authority on the challenges facing mature students in participating in higher education was publish in June 2021&ndash; the findings will be considered in the context of the new National Access Plan due to be published in the coming months. </p>  <p>  Persons in the protection process (asylum and subsidiary protection) or leave to remain process are not eligible to access the statutory based SUSI grant scheme. However, the administratively based Student Support Scheme provides supports along similar lines to the SUSI grant scheme and is available to persons in the asylum, subsidiary protection or leave to remain process.  </p>  <p>  Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is built. The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including those in traditionally less well represented groups. FET provision is largely free or heavily subsidised, and a number of financial supports may be available to learners to facilitate the participation of individuals who would not otherwise be in a position to take up training. I would encourage people to make an appointment with their local Adult Education Guidance Service (AEGS), available in each Education and Training Boards (ETB) across the country free of charge, to discuss what supports may be available to them.</p></reply>

Institutions were requested to produce individual action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment and to submit these to the HEA Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality, whose responsibilities have been expanded to cover all areas of equality, diversity and inclusion, as well as oversight of the implementation of the Framework for Consent in HEIs.</p>  <p>  As part of monitoring requirements moving forward, the HEA requires that institutions, in respect of both staff and students, report progress annually on implementation of the Framework for Consent. </p>  <p>  My Department has provided support for a number of consent awareness raising and training initiatives in the HEIs, including the:</p>  <p>  - UIG Active Consent Programme</p>  <p>  - UCC Bystander Training</p>  <p>  - Speak Out report and support online platform</p>  <p>  - The ESHTE Toolkit and It Stops Now Campaign led by the NWCI in conjunction with USI.</p>  <p>  My Department is partnering with the Department of Justice and the NUIG Active Consent programme to support the development of an online hub that will provide, for the first time, an integrated, publicly available resource on sexual consent awareness and learning, which will be an important resource for our further and higher education institutions and the wider community.</p>  <p>  The IUA has published guidelines entitled 'Guidelines for Universities on How to Respond to Alleged Staff or Student of University Related Sexual Misconduct', which are available to assist HEIs in this area.</p>  <p>  THEA launched their PROPEL Report (Promoting Consent and Preventing Sexual Violence), in March 2021, with funding from my Department.  The PROPEL report details key components and options for inclusion in institutional action plans, outline of best practice and guidelines for emerging policies and procedures in this area and a series of conclusions and recommendations.</p>  <p>  With regard to the recently published surveys of student and staff experiences of sexual violence and harassment in higher education, I want to take this opportunity to thank students and staff across the country who took the time to engage with this survey and share their experiences with us. A total of 11,417 responses were analysed (7,901 students and 3,516 staff) and inform the findings.</p>  <p>  The survey findings point to some positive developments in the higher education institutions that can be built upon in areas such as awareness raising and education. But there are also some deeply troubling findings, such as the levels of sexual harassment experienced by staff and students that responded to the survey and particularly the female students that reported that they had experienced sexual violence. </p>  <p>  An Expert Advisory Group chaired by the HEA is currently reviewing the survey reports and will be submitting proposed actions shortly which will complement the work already underway on the Consent Framework in the higher education sector.</p>  <p>  I will continue to lead the way on institutional change, championing the changes required to achieve a cultural norm where bullying and sexual harassment are not tolerated.</p></reply>

In selecting candidates for the positions of census enumerator, the CSO called over 12,700 people to interview and all applicants were assessed on the basis of their skills, abilities, and suitability for the post in question. An order of merit was established in each field area, based on the results of the interview process. The jobs were ultimately offered to the most qualified candidates. In some areas, there were large numbers of well qualified candidates and although people passed the interview and were placed on the order of merit, due to the number of positions available in the area, not all candidates were offered jobs. </p></reply>

This will include floating offshore wind energy. The Programme for Government commits to the achievement of 5GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030 and a further commitment to develop a longer-term plan to harness the estimated potential of at least 30GW of offshore floating wind power in our Atlantic waters. </p>  <p>  The 5GW target will be primarily met through development of offshore renewable energy in Ireland&rsquo;s eastern and southern coastal regions. This reflects the suitability of water depths in these regions for deployment of conventional fixed bottom offshore wind turbines and existing electricity grid infrastructure to connect these projects to the onshore grid. Subsequent cost-effective deployment of renewables in deeper waters off the west coast, to take advantage of greater wind resources, should be increasingly feasible through future advances in floating turbine technology. The Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021 provides the legal underpinning to an entirely new marine planning system, which will balance harnessing our huge offshore wind potential while protecting our rich and unique marine environment. Work on a revised Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP II) is currently in progress and will be completed this year. This will set out the pathway for the development of offshore renewable energy beyond 2030.  </p>  <p>  In Q1 2022, my Department opened a consultation on the proposed assessment criteria for the first batch of Maritime Area Consent (MAC) applications from a set of seven qualified ORE projects. Consultation will also shortly conclude on how the second batch of projects (Phase Two) will be selected to enter the new consenting system. This includes a proposal to allow for an Innovation Category in Phase Two which may be of specific interest to developers of floating offshore wind energy designs.</p></reply>

These proposed terms and conditions include a requirement for each successful project in ORESS 1 to headquarter its operation and maintenance facilities on the island of Ireland. As offshore renewable energy remains an emerging sector in Ireland, successful projects in ORESS 1 will also be required to complete a Project Delivery Plan Questionnaire, with particular emphasis on domestic supply chain development, to better inform Government policy and design of future ORESS auctions.   As referenced in the Climate Action Plan 2021, a cross-Departmental Offshore Renewable Energy Team, chaired by my Department, is being established to capture the wider economic and business opportunities associated with the development of offshore renewables in Ireland. This is being set up in conjunction with the Marine2040 groups to ensure consistency across the State maritime planning system. It will include the identification of supporting infrastructure and supply chain opportunities as Ireland&rsquo;s offshore wind industry becomes established.</p>  <p>  As part of this work, my Department has been working closely with the Department of Transport and the Irish Maritime Development Office to examine the potential to ensure that Irish ports are in a position to benefit from the offshore wind development programme. The Department of Transport, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office, has conducted an assessment of the options for Irish State ports to facilitate development of offshore renewable energy in Ireland, and will shortly publish an associated policy statement. The statement will outline the proposed strategy for the provision of infrastructure at ports to facilitate development and future operation of offshore renewable energy projects.</p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 143,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme.  In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household had increased to &euro;17,100.</p><p>There are currently just over 7,000 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are:</p><p>Awaiting the initial survey of their home;</p><p>Have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor;</p><p>Have been allocated to a contractor for works; or,</p><p>Currently undergoing works. </p><p>Activity under the Scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID pandemic. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2021, the average cycle time from application to completion was approximately 26 months. While this delay was largely driven by COVID related issues, the deeper measures being provided under the scheme since 2018, also involve more substantive works.</p><p>In order to reduce this timeline to completion, the following key actions are being taken:</p><p>The Budget , at &euro;109 million is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund;</p><p>The number of homes retrofitted under the scheme are due to increase from 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month in 2022; </p><p>SEAI has allocated additional staff for the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme;</p><p>SEAI is working to increase contractor output through active contract engagement and management. </p><p>Works under the Scheme recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector and activity did ramp up again towards the end of last year. Based on the foregoing, SEAI target clearing the homes currently on the waiting list in approximately 18 months.  I am advised by SEAI that the homeowner in this instance has been surveyed, had a pre-works Building Energy Rating completed on 8<sup>th</sup>February 2022 and is due to be allocated to a contractor this month.</p></reply>

The first four of these, covering grid connection, Solar PV, the planning process and onshore wind, are available on the SEAI website, with more to be developed in the coming months. A trusted intermediary service is also now in place to assist community projects.

The communal heating network was supplied by a central boiler originally fuelled by biomass, which significantly reduced the carbon footprint of the homes. I understand that the fuel source has since been changed to a gas boiler.</p>  <p>  However, gas prices are not capped in Ireland, and the position of successive Governments, for almost 20 years, has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses. Given recent international developments, however, the importance of moving away from our reliance on imported gas has been underpinned and, instead, we are accelerating the development of renewable energy generation across the country. </p>  <p>  This Government recognises the potential to make use of renewable and waste energy to heat homes and businesses as part of a range of measures to reduce carbon emissions. The Climate Action Plan 2021 contains actions that will provide a solid basis for the appropriate expansion of district heating in Ireland, including the establishment of a Steering Group to oversee the rollout of district heating and ensure that a robust governance framework is put in place. These actions will also ensure consumer protection, in accordance with legislation.</p></reply>

The details are as follows: </p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Project</th>       <th>Approved Funding &euro;</th>       <th>Funds Drawn Down &euro;</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ESB eCars</td>       <td>10,000,000</td>       <td>2,085,457</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tallaght District Heating Scheme</td>       <td>4,447,952</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish Rail &ndash; Hybrid Drive for Inter City Railcar Fleet (Test Phase)</td>       <td>&euro;1,120,000  </td>       <td>318,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3CEA Driving HGV Efficiency into Brexit</td>       <td>1,373,400</td>       <td>77,872</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>16,941,352</td>       <td>2,481,329</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Further information on the projects approved to proceed to validation stage under the first call are available at this link: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/de5d3-climate-action-fund/</i>.</p><p>A further 14 projects have been approved for funding from the Climate Action Fund under the &euro;2 million Creative Climate Action initiative, a collaboration supported by the Climate Action Fund and the Creative Ireland Programme (run by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media).  No funds from the Climate Action Fund have been drawn down to date in relation to this initiative as the Creative Ireland Programme funds are being used in the first place for these projects. Climate Action Fund funds are expected to be drawn down later this year. Further details on the projects are available at this link - <i>www.creativeireland.gov.ie/en/blog/creative-climate-action-fund-projects/</i>.</p><p>The remaining commitments mainly relate to projects progressing through validation, projects currently being assessed under the Community Climate Action Programme open call, and projects awaiting the approval under the EU LIFE Programme required to secure final approval to co-financing from the Climate Action Fund. </p><p>In relation to innovative projects, innovation has been a key criterion in the assessment of projects for funding from the Climate Action Fund to date. For example, the Tallaght District Heating System is the first of its kind in Ireland and will use waste heat from a data centre to heat surrounding buildings. The Creative Climate Action Fund initiative is seeking to engage citizens in climate action in innovative and creative ways. Innovation is also a key criterion in the assessment of projects under the Community Climate Action Programme open call. </p><p>As a next step, an open call will be developed for launch in 2022 aimed at providing funding for further projects aligned with the priorities of the Government's Climate Action Plan 2021. Work on the development of this call will commence shortly. Details on the scope of the call and eligibility criteria will be available on my Department's website in due course.</p></reply>

In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on PSO public transport services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO services every day. &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares; this funding does not include an extension of the scheme to private coach and bus operators. As the Deputies will be aware, unlike with PSO services, the National Transport Authority (NTA) do not set, monitor or regulate fares on services run by commercial operators.</p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.</p>  <p>  Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system particularly in areas which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services. In recognition of this, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic the Government have provided temporary financial supports for certain licensed commercial services with a view to protecting capacity across the public transport sector throughout the crisis.</p>  <p>  The temporary support was initially introduced for a period of 6-months in June 2020, however owing to the continued fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue, the support has been extended a number of times. To date c.&euro;60m has been provided to support the Commercial Bus Operators.

This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure.</p><p>Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger. Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and expects a scheme for apartments to open shortly.</p><p>There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles -  Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete. 258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p><p>Further details on the progression of this project can be found at <i>esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades</i>.</p><p>The Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort. A package of supports including a revamped scheme is expected to launch alongside the Infrastructure Strategy.</p><p>Thirteen local authorities have been in touch with SEAI in relation to the Public Points Scheme. To date, letters of offer have issued to Louth County Council and Dublin City Council in 2021 to install a total of 29 charge points within their administrative areas. </p><p>I am also aware that a report was published by the CCMA on the provision of guidance to local authorities on the provision of charging infrastructure. The document is available for viewing online at <i>www.lgma.ie/en/publications/general-publications/local-authority-electrification-of-fleet-and-ev-charging-guidance.pdf</i>.</p><p>My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p><p>In light of the ESB eCars responsibility in the matter of the provision of charge points, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the ESB for direct response.  Please contact my Office if no reply is received within 10 working days.</p></reply>

The amount on which VAT is chargeable, in accordance with section 37(1) of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, is the total consideration receivable by the supplier, &ldquo;including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever&rdquo; but not including the VAT itself. </p>  <p>  In this respect, in the case of an energy bill, which includes carbon tax, VAT law dictates that VAT should be calculated on the carbon tax element of the bill as well as the charge for the service. Similarly, where an electricity bill includes the PSO levy, VAT is charged on the full amount of the charge to the customer, which includes the PSO levy.  The same situation applies in the case of other excises, including for example excises on petrol, auto-diesel, tobacco and alcohol products, where the VAT charged on these goods is also charged on the excise value.</p></reply>

As such the powers available to directors of an investment fund to compulsorily redeem investors form a contractual term as between the investor and the investment fund.</p>  <p>  While decisions related to the strategic direction of regulated firms are for the boards of those firms, I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that they have made it clear to the management of the bank in question that it expects a customer-focused approach to be taken in all aspects of business including the area mentioned by the Deputy. I am further advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that it expects regulated entities to have a sound legal basis on which to redeem customer investments, and to provide clear and timely notice to affected customers.</p></reply>

Seventy-one countries, including Russia and Belarus have a shareholding in the EBRD.  </p>  <p>  Ireland is a founding member of the Bank and is part of a multi country constituency with Denmark, Lithuania and Kosovo.  In this regard, the Danish representative, currently holds the rotating Director post, which acts on behalf of our constituency.  That said, there is an Advisor, seconded from my Department, to the constituency office in London, who works closely with the Director.  Officials in my Department engage extensively and constructively with these EBRD officials and I am kept appraised on an ongoing basis of developments within the EBRD.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the specific query, on 1 March, the EBRD Board of Directors approved a recommendation to the Board of Governors for the suspension and modification of access to Bank resources by the Russian Federation and Belarus.  I understand that if the Board of Governors adopts this recommendation, the EBRD would not finance any new operations, would not implement any technical cooperation projects and would suspend or cancel any future disbursements under existing operations in both Russia and Belarus.  This resolution will require the support of 49 Governors, two thirds of the Board Governors with three quarters of the voting power, and a vote is expected on it shortly.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy can rest assured that I fully support this proposal, and I welcome that the EBRD is acting in such a decisive manner on this issue. </p></reply>

This will benefit just over 70,000 families</p><p>- the working family payment budget increase will be brought forward from 1 June to 1 April</p><p>- reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children</p><p>In designing a support package, the Government was conscious of the need to target the main underlying problem &ndash; higher energy prices &ndash; while operating within the fiscal framework set out in the Summer Economic Statement. This suite of measures strikes the appropriate balance and provides support to every domestic electricity account via the electricity credit, but also provides specific supports for more vulnerable households through targeted welfare measures.</p><p>The package of measures announced by the Government provides support to households in rural and urban areas alike. The &euro;200 energy credit is available to all domestic electricity account holders.The targeted welfare support measures provide financial support to households regardless of geographical location.  The 20 percent fare reduction is available on all public transport routes including Bus &Eacute;ireann and Local Link.</p><p>However, I recognise that rural areas have less transport options compared to urban areas.This is an issue which the government is currently addressing.  As set out in the National Development Plan, the Government is committed to strengthening rural economies and communities and enhancing regional accessibility, with a range of investments proposed in new and existing public transport infrastructure.The Plan also commits to significant investment in the land transport network and the upcoming National Investment Framework for Transport in Ireland will set out the priorities for investment in the land transport network.</p><p>The Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, Our Rural Future, also contains over 150 commitments to the improvement of the quality of life in rural Ireland, to be delivered by central Government Departments, State agencies and local authorities.  These include commitments to providing improved rural transport services, piloting new transport initiatives to enhance the quality of life for people in rural areas, and ensuring that public transport services in rural and regional areas are accessible to those with disabilities or reduced mobility.  </p><p>The Policy aims to develop expanded Local Link Services and to further integrate Local Link Services with other existing public transport services through the rollout of the National Transport Authority&rsquo;s Connecting Ireland Plan.  There is also a commitment to develop a grant-aided Community Transport Service Scheme through Local Link, as well as to running a pilot to examine the potential for hail-riding services to improve rural connectivity and to develop a subsidised Local Area Hackney Scheme in designated areas that are too small to support a full-time taxi or hackney service.  </p><p>The Policy also commits to investing in high quality walking and cycling infrastructure specifically targeted at towns and villages across the country, investing in the local and regional road network to maintain roads to a proper standard and to increase regional connectivity and to increasing investment in the repair of non-public roads through the Local Improvement Scheme.</p><p>The Government will continue to look at providing improvements in the public transport sector as more funding becomes available through further increases in the carbon tax.</p></reply>

For the purposes of complying with section 22, my Department publishes information regarding protected disclosures formally identified as such, without identifying the person making the disclosure.  </p><p>Previous reports indicate that one protected disclosure was received in 2019 and no protected disclosures were received during 2020 or 2021, with a report of this due to be published by June of this year.  There is no protected disclosure to date in 2022.  </p><p>Tabular summary: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>No of   Protected Disclosures</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>nil</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021</td>       <td>nil</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022</td>       <td>nil to date</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>An external contractor, from the Panel established by the Office of Government Procurement to provide services in respect of protected disclosures to Government Departments, was engaged to investigate the protected disclosure received in 2019 on foot of a competitive tender. That investigation has now concluded and the total expenditure involved was &euro;65,672.09.</p><p>In line with section 16 of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 in order to protect the identity of the maker of protected disclosures, my Department cannot disclose the nature of disclosures, nor the occupation or area of work of the persons who made protected disclosures to their Department.  However I can confirm that none of these protected disclosures were made by an official (current, former or retired) of the Department. </p><p>In broad terms a protected disclosure is a disclosure of information which the discloser believes may reveal wrongdoing and which came to the attention of the discloser through their employment. This is a very broad category of information and I expect that in many cases disclosures falling into this category are received and dealt with properly without the person making the disclosure or those receiving it ever adverting to the fact that the information constitutes a protected disclosure.</p><p>The obligations which arise in respect of protected disclosures consist principally of not penalising the discloser for making the disclosure and protecting the identity of the person making the disclosure in some circumstances.  These obligations would be routinely met without the need for any legal obligation to compel this to occur, so that it is generally not relevant whether the information constitutes a protected disclosure within the meaning of the legislation or not. It is therefore not possible to be certain that no disclosures which fall within the definition of protected disclosures but which have not been formally identified as such have been received and in fact it is very likely that this has occurred. </p><p>It is for these reasons that it is not possible to provide a comprehensive and exhaustive response to the Deputy's question.  Having said that, it is important to state that my Department has put in place policy and procedures for the making of Protected Disclosures in the Department of Finance, which have been developed in line with the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and agreed by the Department&rsquo;s Executive Board. This sets out the process by which a &lsquo;worker&rsquo; of the Department can make a protected disclosure, what will happen when a disclosure is made and what the Department will do to protect the discloser.</p><p>The process supports the Department&rsquo;s strong commitment to ensuring that the culture and working environment of the Department encourage, facilitate and support any member of staff of the Department in &lsquo;speaking up&rsquo; on any issue that may impact adversely on the Department&rsquo;s ability to properly and fully carry out all its roles and responsibilities to the high performance standard required. Two alternative confidential recipients have been nominated to receive protected disclosures from internal staff, in the event that a staff member does not wish to make the disclosure to their line manager or the normal senior management team. These nominees are the Head of Legal and the Compliance Officer. To date, neither of these officers have received such an internal protected disclosure.</p></reply>

The review concluded that the continuation of the scheme could give rise to displacement of labour from work on new builds to work on home renovations and would create a high opportunity cost of labour which was not present at the inception of the scheme. </p><p>Also, in 2019, in the context of Tax Strategy Group (TSG) deliberations, my Department examined the concept of a tax incentive along the lines of the HRI for domestic retrofit projects. The relevant TSG paper was published with the Budget 2020 documentation.  It indicated that there could be a duplication of supports with the direct Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) grant system already in place and that a scheme such as this could conflict with the need to increase overall housing supply.  </p><p>The paper observed that:</p><p>- In terms of current direct expenditure measures in the energy efficiency sector, the Government continues to make grants available to householders who wish to improve the energy efficiency of their home;</p><p>- Research undertaken by the ESRI into householder preferences regarding retrofit subsidy schemes found that households strongly prefer cash payment subsidies (i.e. up-front discounts or cash back post works) versus other indirect methods of financial support such as tax credits); and</p><p>- From an equity perspective, tax expenditure measures can be regressive by nature, given that only those who pay taxes qualify, and those with greatest income benefit the most. As such, a tax incentive measure as proposed may be of little benefit to certain groups who are most likely to suffer from energy poverty, for example the elderly or those on limited incomes.</p><p>It is my view that these observations still hold true. </p><p>More generally, proposals for tax expenditure measures are assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.  These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p><p>In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has approved the National Retrofitting Scheme, which is a package of supports to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes with lower energy bills.  The scheme will be administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). </p></reply>

Of the 190 transfers, 82 were aided by the Credit Union Restructuring Board, which operated from 2013 to 31 July 2017. </p>  <p>  A transfer of engagements is a voluntary process whereby an individual credit union (a transferor) transfers all of its assets, liabilities and undertakings to another credit union, typically within the proximate geographical area. This ensures the continued availability credit union services in the transferor&rsquo;s common bond. </p>  <p>  The Thematic Review of Restructuring in the Credit Union Sector, published by the Central Bank in February 2019, found that while the number of registered credit unions had reduced by 35% from 30 September 2013 to 30 September 2018, there was only an 8% reduction in business locations operated by credit unions over that period of time. The Review also found that in the 77% of transfers completed between those dates, no business locations had closed as a result of the completion of a transfer.</p>  <p>  The remaining decrease in the numbers of credit unions is attributable to eight voluntary dissolutions, whereby a credit union chooses to cease trading and discharge its assets, liabilities and reserves, and seven resolution actions. Each of these resolution actions was initiated by the Central Bank against extremely distressed and weakened credit unions in circumstances where no voluntary solution could be achieved.</p>  <p>  Although there is legislation and guidance in relation to how a credit union must/should complete a voluntary transfer of engagement process, there is no policy and regulatory framework that requires a credit union to amalgamate with another credit union.</p></reply>

This will be published as soon as possible. This work underway is to ensure fairness in the application of this measure as the Government intended.</p><p>Issues surrounding taxation are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance and any</p><p>questions regarding the tax treatment of payments made by private sector employers to employees should be directed to him. </p></reply>

An exception to this is where the company held the land on trust for another.</p>  <p>  Companies that are dissolved can be restored up to twenty years after dissolution, and if restored the land they held at dissolution reverts to them as if the company had never been dissolved. The Minister's interest is often referred to as a defeasible interest. These provisions are primarily intended to ensure that land is not ownerless. Land can seamlessly transfer into and out of the Minister's ownership without his active occupation or involvement.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works (OPW) administers property of dissolved companies on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This includes the processing of applications for waivers of the Minister's interest to parties that are regarded as having an entitlement.</p>  <p>  An examination of the referenced correspondence may provide some further insight to the status of the property.</p>  <p>  I hope my outlining of the general position above is helpful.  </p></reply>

In accordance with the terms and conditions of the SCP, due to the value of the grants received by the club in the past, it was necessary to execute a Deed of Covenant and Charge in order to protect the public investment in the facility. These requirements were communicated to the club at provisional allocation stage and it was made clear that formal approval could not issue until the legal requirements were finalised. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s legal advisor, the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO), was in regular contact with the club&rsquo;s solicitors in relation to outstanding documentation which was required to progress matters. The final piece of documentation necessary to complete the legal requirements was only submitted by the club&rsquo;s solicitors last month. Confirmation was received from the CSSO last week that the legal requirements were now complete and formal approval issued to the club on Wednesday, 2 March. The club can now submit the documentation necessary to the Department to enable the grant amount to be drawn down and there will be no undue delay in processing any such request. </p></reply>

A key objective is that everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life. </p>  <p>  Aligned with our overall National Planning Framework (NPF) objective for compact growth, vibrant, liveable cities and towns must offer options for both owner occupiers and renters, at all income levels. </p>  <p>  The new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund as outlined in Housing for All, is intended to ensure that aligned with the objectives of the NPF, additional choices are made available to home buyers in our urban cores, and town centres. It will do this by working to extend home ownership options, where the choice is currently limited:</p>  <p>  - In urban areas, for apartment living in developments over a certain height/density threshold;</p>  <p>  - In towns, where options for building new private dwellings have been constrained by the lack of serviced sites.</p>  <p>  In higher density locations, the number of apartments being built for sale poses a challenge. We are also aware of a high level of unactivated permissions, particularly for apartments, in our urban areas. A Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) fund is being established, which through a competitive bid process, will seek to deliver developments at a viable cost for sale to owner occupiers, targeted principally at activating the planning permissions already in place for such homes over the coming five years. The fund will be managed by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department. My Department is working with the Housing Agency in finalising the operational basis for the new fund and expect to engage prospective proposers in a call for proposals in the near future.</p>  <p>  Different challenges arise for facilitating owner-occupation in towns, where viable sites available for building of new homes are in short supply. There is significant potential for local authorities to support homeownership in these areas by making available serviced sites at a reduced cost or providing support towards the refurbishment of vacant properties where the level of vacancy or dereliction is high. A pathfinder programme will be initiated as part of a Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) fund, to facilitate the making available of some 2,000 sites for homes by 2025.</p>  <p>  The approach to the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund is currently under consideration and it is expected that a call for proposals will issue to local authorities later this quarter.</p></reply>

Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates this commitment. </p><p>In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings take place to advance elements of the work. </p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  The full terms of reference of the Working Group are to: </p><p>1.  Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2.  Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>-  Identification and description of defect,</p><p>-  Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>-  Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>-  Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>-  Period of construction affected,</p><p>-  Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>-  Location of dwellings affected.</p><p>1.  Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.</p><p>2.  Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.</p><p>-  In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.</p><p>1.  Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</p><p>-  Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>-  Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>-  individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>-  routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>-  Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>1.  Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>2.  Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the first round of stakeholder consultation commenced in July 2021 with more detailed follow up and additional stakeholder consultations ongoing at present. A series of online surveys was also launched by the Working Group on 31 January seeking the experiences of homeowners, landlords, Directors of Owners&rsquo; Management Companies and Property Management Agents. The surveys will run until 14 March 2022 and can be accessed at the following link  - <i>www.gov.ie/en/consultation/7e319-online-survey-in-relation-to-defects-in-apartment-and-duplex-buildings/</i>.</p><p>The engagement with stakeholders and the online consultation will inform the deliberations of the Working Group and support the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and finalisation of its report. </p><p>I am satisfied that the Working Group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter, and will require sufficient time to complete its work. In that context, I look forward to a report later this year following completion of their consultations and deliberations. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p></reply>

Regulations to set out the detailed criteria for eligibility and the processes for purchase are at an advanced stage and will be issued in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Limerick City and County Council delivered its Housing Delivery Action Plan to me in December 2021, which allowed it to assess the level of need for affordable housing in the Local Authority area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment tool. This will allow the Council to plan provision accordingly. </p>  <p>  Funding for a number of affordable schemes in Limerick was approved in principle in 2019 under the Serviced Sites Fund, to assist in the delivery of approximately 500 affordable purchase and cost rental homes, with these projects currently at planning and design stages. My Department is working closely with Limerick City and County Council to progress these schemes. </p>  <p>  Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act provides the basis for the First Home Scheme, which will be available nationwide. The scheme will support first-time buyers on moderate incomes in purchasing new-build homes by means of an equity share model, similar to that used in the Local Authority Affordable Purchase scheme. First Home will be subject to regional price ceilings reflective of the median prices paid by first-time buyers for new-build homes, so it is an intervention to assist buyers in the lower portion of the home price distribution. The scheme will be targeted at those who have insufficient funds to purchase one of these homes using the mortgage and deposit available to them, and will use equity support to &lsquo;bridge the gap&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 allocated &euro;44 million to my Department for First Home. The banking sector has confirmed it is committed to working with the State to develop and deliver this scheme, and has agreed in principle to match this State funding in order to increase the pool of funding available to potential new homeowners. Subject to the necessary approvals by all parties, it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will operate for the period 2022 to 2025, utilising overall funding of c. &euro;400m to provide support to c. 8,000 households to purchase new homes. </p>  <p>  The scheme will be operated via the First Home Scheme Ireland Designated Activity Company, which has recently been incorporated. Significant work is continuing on the detailed design and parameters of the scheme, and full details including scheme conditionality will be confirmed upon completion of this work. It is anticipated that initial activity, including public communications, will be conducted early in May of this year, in advance of the first receipt of applications and deployment of equity support, which is scheduled for the end of Q2. </p>  <p>  Separately, under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), funding was awarded for a new distributor road and associated infrastructure in Mungret, County Limerick. The original LIHAF housing commitment was estimated at 399 units, to include 60 social, 60 affordable and 179 cost reduced homes with a discount of approximately &euro;9,000. To end 2021, Limerick City and County Council have confirmed that 152 homes have been completed, which includes 81 social and 71 cost reduced homes. The Council has recently indicated that 51 homes will complete in 2022, to include 23 social and 28 cost reduced, and a further 109 homes in 2024, to include 55 social and 54 affordable homes. Final housing numbers and timeline of completion will be available as the project progresses.</p></reply>

Teagasc, however, has undertaken hedgerow mapping on a national scale, and while no comprehensive national survey has been carried out to date, a number of Local Authorities have commissioned hedgerow surveys at county level.</p>  <p>  According to the Teagasc website, in 2020, there were an estimated 689,000 kms of hedgerow in the country using a very broad definition of hedgerow, which includes all woody vegetation growing on a boundary from stockproof hedgerows to relict hedgerows. Hedgerow length varies across the country. Counties around the midlands and the border tend to have the highest density of hedgerows with smaller fields. Cavan has the highest length of hedgerows per hectare. Counties on the western seaboard have the lowest percentage because they have areas of open upland that aren't enclosed. Also, counties like Donegal and Galway have a lot of stonewalls rather than hedgerows. </p>  <p>  Further information on the work of Teagasc in this area can be accessed on the following link: www.teagasc.ie/news--events/daily/environment/mapping-irish-hedgerows.php.</p></reply>

The Plans allow each local authority to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan provision accordingly. The Plans are being revised and updated by local authorities in the light of ongoing engagement and clarifications and I expect that they will be ready for publication by local authorities before the summer. They will provide a comprehensive overview of projected delivery of affordable housing in Cork. </p>  <p>  Funding is made available by Government to assist local authority and Approved Housing Body delivery of affordable housing, for purchase and rent, through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF), previously known as the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), and the Cost Rental Equity Loan. The SSF supported affordable housing development at Boherboy Road will be made available for affordable purchase shortly and a number of AHF and Cost RentaL Equality Loan applications for developments in Cork are at various stages of funding application and approval. </p>  <p>  In terms of delivery of affordable housing in Cork by the LDA,  I am happy to inform the Deputy that the development of a site at St Kevin's Hospital is currently being progressed.

The designation of all existing RPZs has also been extended until 31 December 2024. The Act provides that rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually. This provides rent certainty for tenants outside of RPZs for a minimum 2 year period at a time.</p>  <p>  The Act also introduced measures  to better protect tenants with affordability by  prohibiting any necessary rent increase in a RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP).</p>  <p>  To address the rent affordability challenges building on foot of the unexpectedly fast rising inflation rate, as recorded by HICP (CSO data for January 2022 shows HICP inflation of 5% p.a.), the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021 provides, from 11 December 2021, a cap of 2% per annum pro rata on rent increases in RPZs, where the inflation rate is higher. In effect, this will mean that rents in RPZs may only increase by a maximum of 2% per annum pro rata during times of higher inflation. </p>  <p>  In all cases, section 19(1) of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 prohibits the setting of a rent that exceeds market rent. </p>  <p>  The operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2021 are kept under constant review and any necessary legislation will be introduced.   </p></reply>

Russia&rsquo;s unjustified and unprovoked attack is causing immense suffering for the people of Ukraine. Russia&rsquo;s war is illegal and immoral, and Ireland&rsquo;s support for Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering. Ireland will do all it can to support the humanitarian response both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  As an Taoiseach announced last week, a &euro;10 million Irish Aid Ukraine humanitarian package has been put together to enable organisations on the ground, including the UN and the Red Cross Movement, to provide life-saving assistance to the people of Ukraine. Ireland is also sending urgent medical supplies, including protective suits and masks and disinfectants, in response to a request from Ukraine via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM).</p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland contributes to global funds and core funding to key agencies that are allocating funding to Ukraine, including WHO, OCHA, UNHCR, IFRC, ICRC and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland was the 9th largest donor to the CERF in 2021. Last week, the CERF allocated more than &euro;17.8 million to Ukraine. This year we will increase our annual contribution to the CERF from &euro;10m to &euro;11.5m, as I announced at the CERF pledging conference in December.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is the competent Department on refugees and works with relevant international bodies, including the Red Cross, on assisted refuge, including for those without documents. It would be for immigration officials to determine whether any given individual can access the State.</p>  <p>The EU agreed on the 4 March 2022, to activate the Temporary Protection Directive, which allows a form of temporary protection aimed at offering immediate help by granting large groups of people collective protection status. Such people would have protection status for up to a year (with a possibility of extension of up to three years), without going through individual asylum claims, and allowing access to housing and other benefits (e.g. education, health, social welfare, residency permits).</p></reply>

First time passport applications do take longer to process and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants. In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated.</p><p>Demand for passports continues to be very high with over 156,000 applications received in February. This is the highest number of applications received in any previous month. There are currently 160,000 passport applications in the Passport Service system. Of these, 84,000 are first time applications. While there is a very high volume of applications in the system, this does not represent a backlog. There is a continuous stream of new applications and a continuous dispatch of completed passports happening every day.  </p><p>Figures show that, of the first time applications, 46,000 (55%) are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 38,000 (45%) applications are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. </p><p>My Department has been pro-actively planning to ensure the necessary resources are in place to meet the current and expected level of demand in 2022 and is making an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service in terms of additional staff and improvements to the passport processing and customer service systems.</p><p>My Department has been working with the Public Appointments Service on a major recruitment drive over the past several months. Since June 2021, over 300 members of staff at all grades have been assigned to the Passport Service.  In addition to this, and to complement staffing recruitment through the Public Appointments Service, the Passport Service is running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers with a view to assigning additional staff and to maintain staffing levels to meet the expected demand in the coming months. </p><p>It is a priority for the Passport Service to improve processing times for first time applications in 2022. Along with increased staffing, the Passport Service is implementing a number of further measures that will positively impact the current turnaround times and improve customer service:</p><p>-  Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is underway to increase the resources that can process complex applications.</p><p>-  Passport Service staff are working overtime with a focus on prioritising first time applications with a view to reducing the current turnaround time.</p><p>-  A new document management process has been put in place that allows for a much quicker turnaround time when an applicant is asked to submit additional documents. Once these documents are received, they will be prioritised and complete applications will be processed in 3 weeks. This will greatly reduce the waiting time for applicants who are missing documents in their initial application. </p><p>My Department is confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.</p><p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time.</p></reply>

Irish Aid is supporting Irish NGO efforts through the Emergency Response Fund Scheme (ERFS), designed to support timely and effective responses to sudden onset humanitarian crises. Medical supplies have also been sent from Ireland in coordination with the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.</p><p>From a practical perspective, the most effective way to deliver relief supplies is through broad, streamlined, and coordinated efforts.  People in Ireland who would like to assist are advised to send funds, rather than goods. This can be done through donating to established Irish and international humanitarian organisations.

Without knowing the full facts of these incidents, if these seizures have taken place in order to comply with EU sanctions, this is because the sanctions require that the assets of those on the sanctions list be frozen with immediate effect. Intangible assets such as bank accounts will have been frozen across the EU also. Such asset freezing measures do not permit the appropriation of assets by EU Member States, but rather require that listed persons or entities do not have access to their assets for so long as a sanctions regime persists. EU sanctions are not intended to be permanent, but rather are designed to incentivise a change in behaviour that will ultimately lead to sanctions being lifted.</p><p>Separately, Ireland has provided &euro;10 million in humanitarian aid and medical supplies for those affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>In addition, the EU has agreed a package of &euro;500 million in military assistance for Ukraine under the European Peace Facility; &euro;450 million for lethal equipment and &euro;50 million for non-lethal equipment. Ireland constructively abstained on the lethal equipment package. We will pay our full share (approx &euro;10 million) and our funding will go only to non-lethal elements.</p><p>We will continue to engage with European Union, United Nations and other partners to provide assistance to Ukraine.</p></reply>

Section 16 of the Act makes particular provision for the issuance of diplomatic passports to persons who hold a diplomatic rank or to persons whom the Minister for Foreign Affairs considers it appropriate to issue such a passport in order to carry out their duties. Official passports may be issued to an Irish citizen for the purpose of facilitating travel abroad in connection with the performance of official duties on behalf of the State. Applications are only approved for individuals who are Irish citizens and can demonstrate that they require a passport for travel to undertake official business on behalf of the State.</p>  <p>  The use of diplomatic and official passports is restricted to travel on official State business. Personal passports must be used for all other travel.</p>  <p>  In 2005, the Passport Service began maintaining electronic records of diplomatic and official passports issued. Records of diplomatic and official passports issued before that date are not available. Since 2005, a total of 29,279 diplomatic and official passports have been issued by the Passport Service. In that time, 319 diplomatic and official passports have been reported lost or stolen to the Passport Service. This figure represents 0.01% of the total number of such passports issued from 2005 to date. Of the passports reported lost or stolen, 18 passports have been subsequently found and returned to the Passport Service.</p></reply>

The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries. </p>  <p>  The Integrity Section of the Passport Service was established in 2015 to improve all aspects of passport fraud detection and prevention. Significant resources have been invested in the Integrity Section with an increase in staff numbers and new and improved systems being put in place. A considerable investment in technology and structures has helped to improve the detection and recording of instances of fraud. These resources, along with new procedures introduced by the Passport Service, have prevented fraudulent applications from being submitted and have closed down avenues of access previously used by fraudulent applicants. </p>  <p>  Due to lack of records it is not possible to provide the figures requested prior to 2016. The total number of suspected fraudulent applications investigated by the Integrity Section from 2016 to 28 February 2022 is 4,730 cases. The Passport Service cannot provide an accurate figure of fraudulent passports recovered as in some instances they are recovered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by law enforcement authorities overseas. </p></reply>

As with all other guidelines around public health measures, my Department has been led by expert medical advice provided by the Government through the HSE and other relevant public bodies.  This HSE guidance was reviewed by these medical experts in December 2021.</p>  <p>My Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0042/2021 details the current working arrangements and leave arrangements during the COVID-19 pandemic for teachers and special needs assistants employed in recognised primary and post primary schools.  This Circular should be read in conjunction with Information Note TC 0001/2022 which was published on 18th   January 2022. </p>  <p>  The HSE advice on the &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; group is at link: www2.hse.ie/conditions/covid19/people-at-higher-risk/overview/. Having considered the most up to date HSE advice, if a teacher considers they are at very high risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19, they may apply to the Occupational Health Service (Medmark) for a COVID-19 health risk assessment to be carried out. Having considered the medical information provided with the OHS Risk Assessment Questionnaire, the OHS will provide the teacher with a &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; which advises whether they are at a very high risk of  serious illness from contracting COVID-19.  The COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessments are performed by a team of qualified and experienced specialists in occupational medicine. Available medical evidence, including reports from treating consultants as well as vaccination status of SNAs, are considered during the OHS COVID-19 health risk categorisation assessment process.   </p>  <p>  A teacher who has been categorised by Medmark and considers that the OHS &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; places them in an incorrect risk category, may request a review. Medmark will re-evaluate the medical evidence provided. The teacher may provide additional medical evidence as part of the review process. In a situation where the review outcome is that the COVID-19 health risk categorisation remains the same, a further review will only be undertaken, where additional medical evidence indicates there has been a change in the teacher&rsquo;s medical status or where there is a change in the HSE guidelines for the &lsquo;high risk&rsquo; group.</p>  <p>  The medical advice received by my Department provides that where an employee has been categorised as "high risk", they may attend the workplace using extra care to practice social distancing and hand hygiene and the use of protective equipment.  In such circumstances, there is no facility for special leave with pay for those categorised as "high risk" and any absences due to medical reasons will be recorded under the Sick Leave Scheme.  </p></reply>

The issue was part of the agreement on the pay and conditions  of school secretaries, considered under Clause 2 (iii) of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, and subsequent revisions of this agreement have been agreed through standard union engagement, most recently in 2020.  Additional amendments to this agreement can only be achieved through engagement and collective bargaining agreements between the Government and the public service unions. </p>  <p>  For clarity, the rationale of linking grading to the calculation of the number of WTE teaching staff that a school is entitled to reflects the fact that this calculation relates strongly to the number of students enrolled in a school and other supports as outlined in the agreement.

The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual principal/board of management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. The general principle is that those students with the greatest level of care need receive the greatest level of support. The NCSE provides guidance and support to schools on this matter.</p>  <p>  Where circumstances change during the course of a school year that materially increases the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. </p>  <p>  The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually. Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited in order to observe the current deployment of SNA support in the school setting.</p>  <p>  Where a school is dissatisfied with how their exceptional review has been processed or is dissatisfied with the outcome of their exceptional review they can appeal.</p></reply>

Under this scheme, the Department provided funding of &euro;17.2 million in 2021 to all of these schools.</p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and in order to support the establishment of book rental schemes my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to primary schools.  Circa. 96% of primary schools and 69% of post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school but they are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes.

It will continue to run for the 2021/22 school year and it&rsquo;s effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible. Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per student.  This pilot provided an additional &euro;64 per student to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per student enrolled in the school. </p></reply>

This support was vitally important to ensure that our schools remained open for pupils.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a framework for adapted School Placement arrangements was developed by the Department of Education and the Teaching Council, together with the relevant Initial Teacher Education (ITE) providers, in order to ensure that student teachers at primary level could continue to support schools during periods of planned school placement from the beginning of January up to the February mid-term break. During this period, student teachers continued to be located in their host school for school placement, but were also available to support other schools where required.</p>  <p>  The Education Stakeholders, including the Department of Education, HEIs providing initial teacher education (ITE) and the Teaching Council, have continued to work together to maintain the integrity of the students&rsquo; ITE experiences and support students in satisfactorily completing their ITE programmes.</p>  <p>  The adapted School Placement arrangements were an exceptional measure introduced as part of a suite of measures to support schools to minimise the risk associated with COVID-19 and in light of the prevalence of the Omicron variant, with the understanding that these would be unwound as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  On 17th February 2022, NPHET reviewed the remaining public health measures including the infection prevention control measures and restrictions in school settings.</p>  <p>  Having closely considered relevant epidemiological data and other matters as set out in their letter of 17 February 2022, the Government accepted the recommendations of the NPHET to remove remaining restrictions in schools.</p>  <p>  The Department understands that student teachers will now return to experiencing the more typical School Placement arrangements, and associated assessments, which are a critical part of their ITE programmes. </p>  <p>  While the adapted School Placement arrangements are no longer in place, student teachers will, if they wish, still be able to support schools by providing substitution cover when they have availability outside of their ITE programme requirements.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. The Department with school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on a claim on terms and conditions for grant-funded school secretaries and caretakers.  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands were identified, and a phased approach was being taken to the development of proposals. Throughout the negotiations it has been important to consider both the potential costs of any proposal for the exchequer and also the potential consequences of any agreement for the many other similarly funded roles throughout the public sector.</p>  <p>On the 24th February, following a series of engagements at the WRC, a package to settle the claim was proposed which F&oacute;rsa have agreed to recommend to its members. A ballot will now be undertaken and we await the outcome. The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.</p>  <p>  In addition to an incremental salary scale, Secretaries may also choose to receive additional increments if they decide that they no longer wish to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The package of proposals on offer to school secretaries also include standardised terms and conditions in relation to  annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.</p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries at present. As set out in the framework agreement of 14 September 2021, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. Should the proposal be agreed and an implementation plan put in place, intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p>  <p>  This agreement is further acknowledgment of the excellent and often unheralded work carried out on the ground by secretaries and caretakers in our schools. I welcome F&oacute;rsa&rsquo;s decision to ballot their members on this agreed suite of measures for staff who are the beating heart of our school community. This important step forward is the result of great co-operation on the part of all concerned, and I would encourage school secretaries to vote in favour of it.</p></reply>

However in line with CWMF procurement rules and recent new guidance and changes to Public Work Contracts (PWC), issued by the OGP, the following scenarios are being implemented by the Department of Education:</p>  <p>  1.  Where tenders are submitted and the apparently most advantageous tender (typically the lowest) is identified and subsequently withdraws, the next lowest tender is asked if they will stand over their price and accept the contract.

The Department then provides grant aid to the school in respect of the rental costs. </p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the details of amounts paid to all parties including both school authorities and third parties for the rental of land and buildings for school accommodation by county and year from 2013 is currently being compiled and will be forwarded in the coming days. The Deputy should note that payments to individual schools is commercially sensitive and cannot therefore be provided.</p>  <p>  While it is the policy of my Department to ensure a high standard of permanent accommodation for all schools, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population over the last decade or more it is sometimes necessary to make use of rental of properties as interim solutions to meet the accommodation needs of schools. Furthermore, it may also be necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation when an immediate or short term need arises. For example, a school may require a temporary site or building in circumstances where a major school construction project is planned. The rental is terminated when the major project concerned is completed. The length of time it is necessary to make use of the rented property will vary from project to project.</p>  <p>  There are approximately 1,200 school building projects within the current pipeline across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction - most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period 2021 to 2025.  The progression and completion of these projects is and will make further inroads on the replacement of rented sites and buildings with knock-on savings on the rental budget.</p>  <p>  Many schools based in rented buildings and on rented sites are already part of the pipeline of projects under the school building programme and their longer-term accommodation will be addressed as part of these projects.  Maximising the opportunities to achieve value for money involves matching, as best as possible, the accommodation requirement with the appropriate accommodation solution. This is relevant for all accommodation projects progressed by the Department.</p>  <p>  The changing landscape in relation to enrolments means that accommodation requirements can vary regionally and between short, medium and long-term and this is a relevant factor considered by the Department in determining the type of accommodation solution to be put in place.</p></reply>

As is specified in the 2012 Act, the amount of &euro;110m, plus interest of &euro;1.38m, was made available to Caranua, and held in a Statutory Fund managed by the NTMA.</p>  <p>  It was not the role of Caranua to provide redress.  To be eligible to apply to Caranua for funding supports, applicants had to have been in receipt of an award of redress from the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme, or to have qualified for such an award had they not already received similar awards or settlements in court proceedings.</p>  <p>  Given the finite nature of the funding available, Caranua announced in May 2018 that it would cease to accept applications from 1 August 2018.  After that date, it focussed on processing </p>  <p>  applications on hand. It also undertook targeted outreach to certain groups, including survivors who were in prison.  As part of this process, Caranua engaged extensively with applicants who had not completed the application process, and established timelines for the provision of supporting documentation which would enable their applications to be progressed before Caranua was required to wind-down its operations.  </p>  <p>  All outstanding applications were finalised by Caranua by March 2021.  Overall, Caranua received over 62,000 applications for funding supports from 6,181 eligible survivors, of which 92% were approved. Over 57,000 payments were made to survivors. </p>  <p>  The very limited funding remaining at this point will be required to discharge legal costs, audit costs and other outgoings.</p></reply>

Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in a number of school planning areas including the school planning area Dublin 13 Donaghmede Howth.</p>  <p>  Where capacity issues arise it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  - Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place  to a number of schools in the area</p>  <p>  - School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  - Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school there are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  - External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  Similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.</p>  <p>  The projected peak year for the Donaghmede Howth Post-Primary School Planning Area is 2024 with 4,263 places required.  The current 2021 enrolment is 4,043 pupils.  There are currently 9 post primary schools in this school planning area area, of which one is fee paying. </p>  <p>  The opening of a 1,000 pupil school has been deferred from the original planned year of establishment. A further exercise has since been conducted on the necessity for the establishment of a number of planned new schools, taking into account a number of factors, including the pace of delivery of the expected additional residential development in the school planning areas, associated enrolments and the capacity in existing schools in the areas. As a result, the establishment of some of the planned new schools have been deferred.  The pace of delivery of additional residential developments, along with updated enrolment data and demographic data will be kept under review and this will inform the timing of school requirements.</p>  <p>  A number of school building projects are in train or proposed in the School Planning Area as outlined below: </p>  <p>  - St. Mary&rsquo;s Secondary School, Baldoyle. A refurbishment project is ongoing which also includes the provision of an additional home-economics room. The project is at stage 4.</p>  <p>  - Santa Sabina Dominican College. A project which will provide an additional four general classrooms has been approved under the Additional School Accommodation Scheme. The project is at stage one. </p>  <p>  - Belmayne Educate Together Secondary School was established in 2019.  The school is in interim accommodation on its permanent site and three additional classrooms and one specialist room has been approved for the 2022/2023 academic year. A major project to provide permanent accommodation for the school is currently at tender stage. The school will cater for 1,000 pupils in the long-term.</p>  <p>  - Gaelcholaiste Reachrann.  A major project to provide permanent accommodation for the school is at tender stage and construction is expected to be completed by mid 2024. This will provide capacity for 600 pupils.</p>  <p>  - Grange Community College. There are plans to expand this school to cater for 1,000 pupils and the project is currently at Project Brief stage. </p>  <p>  - St. Fintan&rsquo;s High School. A project is proposed for this school which is currently at Project Brief stage.</p>  <p>  The annual admissions notice for each of the schools in the school planning area is available on the individual school website.</p>  <p>  Similarly for the primary School Planning Area for Donaghmede Howth, the peak enrolment year is expected to be 2024. There are 16 primary schools in this School Planning Area. Two new primary schools were established in this school planning area recently:</p>  <p>  - Stapolin ETNS was established in 2019.  A proposed new 16-classroom school is currently at tender stage. The school is currently in interim accommodation pending construction of the permanent new school building. The school is currently a 4-teacher school.</p>  <p>  - Killester Raheny Clontarf ETNS was established in 2019. It is currently a 2-teacher school and is operating in interim accommodation.  With regard to meeting the school's interim and longer term accommodation needs,  the Department is currently engaging with City of Dublin Education &amp;amp; Training Board (CDETB) in respect of property matters generally. As part of these discussions, it has been proposed that Killester Raheny Clontarf ETNS will be permanently located at Killester College of Further Education.  This engagement with CDETB is ongoing. The Department is actively working to put both permanent and new interim accommodation arrangements in place for Killester Raheny Clontarf ETNS and will confirm these arrangements to the school patron as soon as it is possible to do so.</p>  <p>  It is expected that these new schools together with the existing primary school accommodation will cater for the future primary school demand for Donaghmede Howth school planning area.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p>-<font color="#001A26">Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in  the normal way.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised.

I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen an additional 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year. </p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>The NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>In terms of County Wexford, I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special classes for students with autism in primary and post-primary schools.  Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years to meet the demand for places.</p><p>We are always grateful to those schools that have responded, and continue to respond positively to meet the educational needs of children in their communities. </p><p>Currently, a network of 47 primary special classes, including 6 Early Intervention ASD classes and 19 post primary special classes provide specialist placements for students with autism in County Wexford.  5 of these classes were newly established at primary level and 3 at post primary level giving a total of 8 new special classes for the current school year.  Each class has placements for up to a maximum of 6 students per class.</p><p>The NCSE is continuing to engage with primary and post-primary schools throughout County Wexford regarding the establishment of additional special classes for 2022/23 and beyond. There are specific plans in place to open additional special classes and every support will be made available to progress their opening in the shortest possible timeframe with a particular focus on September next. </p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class. </p><p>I should also clarify that the NCSE does not maintain waiting lists for schools.  Boards of management of individual schools are responsible for such enrolment matters. </p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p><p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the type and location of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at <i>www.ncse.ie/special-classes</i>.</p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. </p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions: </p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.  </p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process. </p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>The arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for mainstream classes for the 2022/23 school year are currently under review. An announcement on the matter will be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These EU wide standards are binding objectives to be achieved by Member States.  The provisions of the IORP II Directive therefore applies to all funded occupational pension schemes and trust Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) operating in Ireland.  The Directive was transposed into Irish law by way of the European Union (Occupational Pension Schemes) Regulations 2021 (SI No. 128 of 2021) on 22nd April 2021. </p>  <p>  The general principle followed in respect of the transposition of the Directive, in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Pensions Reform, is that the requirements of the Directive have been applied to all schemes and trust RACs, where possible and as appropriate, in order to ensure that all members and beneficiaries are afforded equal protection irrespective of the size of the scheme.  In relation to existing one-member arrangements, post-transposition, IORP II investment and borrowing rules will apply only to new investments or borrowings entered into by such arrangements.  Furthermore, for these existing one-member arrangements, a five-year derogation has been provided from all other new IORP II requirements.</p>  <p>  With 160,000 occupational pension schemes in the country, Ireland is a significant outlier with many more small and single member schemes than any other European country.  Reducing this very large number of schemes will help to improve the overall standard of scheme governance and to reduce overall pension costs and risk for members.  Scheme consolidation is a stated aim of the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018 &ndash; 2023.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that, in the future, Master Trusts will serve as a model for a significant portion of the Irish pensions market and trustees of smaller schemes may choose to transfer their members into such an arrangement.  Master Trusts are multi-employer pension schemes under the governance of a single trustee board.  It is anticipated that the consolidation of existing schemes into Master Trusts arrangements may offer certain advantages to employers and pension savers including increased economies of scale, higher scheme governance standards and levels of security and could potentially reduce administrative costs for such schemes.  Ultimately, it will be up to scheme trustees and sponsoring employers to decide on the pension arrangement that best suits their needs and provides the optimal result for their members.  My Department has no input or role in relation to such decisions and cannot predetermine any choices made by trustees and employers in respect of their individual pension schemes.  </p>  <p>  With regard to any prospective deadline, the Deputy may wish to note that the supervision of compliance with the requirements of both the Directive and the Pensions Act overall is the responsibility of the Pensions Authority, which is the regulator for pensions in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p><p>To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme. Through this Annual Programme, priority has been attached to, inter alia, the creation of places for children under 3.</p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p><p>Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early earning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services. Indeed, data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21% and the vacancy rates for all age groups having risen significantly compared to two years ago. <table>    <tr>       <th>National Vacancy Rate By Age (June 2021)</th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Up to 1 year (0-12 months)</td>       <td>20% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1 year+ to 2 years (13-24 months)</td>       <td>10% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2 years+ to 3 years (25-36 months)</td>       <td>17% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3 years+ to 4 years (37-48 months)</td>       <td>17% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months) Non-School-Going</td>       <td>12% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>4 years+ to 5 years (49-60 months) School-Going</td>       <td>42% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months) Non-school going</td>       <td>30% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>5 years+ to 6 years (61-72 months) School going</td>       <td>48% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>6 years+ to 8 years (73-96 months)</td>       <td>37% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>8 years+</td>       <td>34% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>21% </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>My Department is continuing to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, particularly in light of the recent lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>Pobal has, using the data captured in June 2021 and current registration data, recently projected vacancy rates in February 2022. While this analysis shows a fall in vacancy rates from June 2021 to February 2022 &ndash; with vacancy rates falling from 21% to 19%, this analysis suggests that there is unused capacity across the country. Further analysis is being undertaken by Pobal to establish if this unused capacity varies by type of provision or location, to establish the degree of mismatch is supply and demand for certain cohorts or children or in certain areas.</p><p>Pobal will also commence new data collection in April 2022, as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey. This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established. </p><p>In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery so, for example, greater funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings.</p><p>Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

This work includes consideration of the disability ground. </p>  <p>  In addition, I am working to fully commence the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which will be possible once the supporting legislation, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill, has been enacted. This important legislation moves us from a status based definition of capacity to a functional approach where capacity is assessed in relation to the decisions needing to be taken. This legislation is key for further realising the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD). The Amendment Bill will also include many of the provisions of the previous Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which lapsed with the last D&aacute;il.

This responsibility includes the accommodation needs of young persons leaving all forms of State care, including that of foster care. </p><p>Policy responsibility for homeless young people, insofar as it extends to DCEDIY, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991. Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care. Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided with accommodation under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991.</p><p>Young adults leaving State care from foster care, and who have one year&rsquo;s care experience between the ages of 13 &ndash; 18 years of age, are eligible for referral to the aftercare service. </p><p>In addition Tusla have a legal obligation to have an aftercare plan for every young person who is eligible for an aftercare service, which is informed by an assessment of need carried out prior to the young person leaving care. This requirement to carry out an assessment of need has been legislated for through section 45a of the Child Care act, 1991, (as amended by the Child Care (Amendment) Act, 2015). Specifically section 45a(3)(f) of the Act stipulates that the assessment shall include any accommodation needs the young person may have. A requirement as to whether the young person would benefit from the allocation of an aftercare worker, also forms part of the assessment of need. </p><p>Once allocated, an aftercare worker will work in partnership with the young person in assessing their accommodation needs and securing accommodation to meet these needs.  In this process the aftercare worker works in partnership with other key stakeholders in securing suitable accommodation. This may include the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the HSE, and Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration &amp;amp; Youth on projects to secure housing for eligible young adults leaving foster care.  </p><p>Eligible young adults leaving foster care are also entitled to an aftercare grant. The aftercare grant is a once off payment paid to the eligible adult when they leave placement and is to assist with rent/ deposit and startup costs associated with initial moving home expenses.</p><p>An aftercare allowance may also be available to eligible young adults transitioning from foster care and towards independent living. The allowance currently amounts to &euro;300 a week and is dependent on the eligible young adult attending an accredited education course, third level course or training programme as outlined in the young adult&rsquo;s Aftercare Plan. </p><p>The allowance is provided to cover a young adults day to day costs, including accommodation as they progress in their chosen accredited course or training program. Continuing in further education or training entitles the young person to receive the aftercare allowance even after they turn 21 and up until 23 years of age.</p><p>The data below demonstrates the range of accommodation types for young adults in receipt of an aftercare service, Q4 2021.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Accommodation Type</th>       <th>#</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Residential Care Placement (over 18 years)</td>       <td>144</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Remained Living with Foster Carers</td>       <td>1047</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Independent Living </td>       <td>639</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Designated Care Leavers Accommodation (CAS)</td>       <td>54</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>At Home</td>       <td>213</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Supported Lodgings</td>       <td>46</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&quot;Other&quot; Accommodation </td>       <td>196</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>2339</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Tusla, the Child and Family Agency provides supports for victims of domestic violence primarily through funded NGO service providers.</p>  <p>  Government has agreed that the Department of Justice will assume responsibility for responding to DSGBV, and that the responsibility for policy and services will sit within that Department. Tusla will continue to have responsibility for the existing DSGBV services it provides and funds until the new administrative arrangements are in place. </p>  <p>  Minister McEntee is leading on the development of a new whole-of-government 3rd national strategy to combat DSGBV. The goal of the strategy is zero tolerance for violence against women and it will be structured around the four pillars of the Istanbul Convention: prevention, protection, prosecution and co-ordinated policies. </p>  <p>  The Strategy will be accompanied by a detailed action plan setting out how each of the aims will be achieved, who is responsible for them and the timeframe for delivery. This is currently being drafted with the sector so that it is targeted, ambitious and deliverable.</p>  <p>  Feedback is also being invited through a focused consultation process on the final draft of the strategy. The draft strategy has been shared as part of the ongoing consultation led by Minister McEntee. A public consultation is also underway and it will help ensure that the Strategy is correctly focused on addressing the areas that people feel need the most urgent attention.</p>  <p>  Following these consultations, the strategy and action plan will be finalised, brought to Government, and it is expected that the Strategy will be published in April.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Third National Strategy will also make provision for how we deliver refuge spaces, both in the immediate and longer term, to cater for the needs of victims. </p>  <p>  Tusla&rsquo;s recently published &lsquo;Review of the Provision of Accommodation for Victims of Domestic Violence&rsquo; assesses the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation and has examined the current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for services and unmet need, and analysis of proximity to refuge by local communities.</p>  <p>  Government will be guided by the recommendations of the Review. I expect that the implementation process for the Review will identify priority areas where there is greatest urgency in achieving safe accommodation for victims of DSGBV.  </p></reply>

As your question relates to the vulnerability assessment (VA) process for linking international protection applicants to healthcare services and supports, I would like to inform you about stage 2 of the VA process.</p>  <p>  As you may know Deputy, Stage 2 VAs are carried out following a referral from a possible vulnerability being identified in a Stage 1 VA, the screening process to determine if an applicant is vulnerable or not. </p>  <p>  Stage 2 VAs are conducted by social workers in the International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) who embrace an evidenced-based approach to screening and assessment. </p>  <p>  Stage 2 VAs seek to refer anyone with identified significant vulnerability/needs to access comparable services to that of the Irish population. The referrals include, among other services, non-governmental organisations such as Peter McVerry Trust, Health Service Executive services including paediatric, mental health, primary care services, specialist services such as Ruhama and Spirasi,  and education including TUSLA Education Support Services.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in cases where children are concerned, the guiding principle is the best interests of the child in all decisions that affect them as required by the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, in particular Article 3 on the best interests of the child, and Article 22 on the special protection needs of refugee children. </p>  <p>  IPAS social workers carry out Stage 2 VAs for children who are accompanied by their parents/guardians. Unaccompanied minors seeking international protection are the responsibility of the Child and Family Agency, TUSLA. </p>  <p>  Importantly, Stage 2 VAs identify and respond to the impact of trauma by referring to specialist services such as Spirasi, as well as ensuring that appropriate follow-up assessments and intervention are undertaken.  </p>  <p>  Stage 2 VAs make recommendations in relation to accommodation needs. IPAS endeavour to accommodate the needs of international protection applicants who have been deemed vulnerable within the meaning of the reception conditions directive in so far as possible, and to take all appropriate actions required to address those needs.</p>  <p>  It is the policy of IPAS to consider any identified vulnerabilities in allocating accommodation to applicants, within the overall constraints of the accommodation available. This means that it is not always possible for IPAS to address all identified vulnerabilities optimally when allocating accommodation. However, where possible, IPAS will improve the alignment between accommodation and vulnerabilities as more appropriate accommodation becomes available. </p></reply>

However, I can confirm that accommodation will initially be made available by the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of my Department to those Ukrainian nationals who seek international protection in Ireland should they require it. </p>  <p>  My officials are actively working to procure accommodation and supports for Ukrainian arrivals to Ireland through hotel accommodation in the first instance and various other accommodation solutions including the use of modular housing on state owned land.   </p>  <p>  In addition, on 18 January 2022, my Department published a request for tender (RFT) to procure additional accommodation. This tender process is a key plank in DCEDIY&rsquo;s strategy to end reliance on emergency accommodation and will assist in alleviating the accommodation pressures currently being experienced.</p>  <p>  The compliance evaluation process is currently underway and it is anticipated that this process will result in additional capacity.</p>  <p>  We appreciate that many people may wish to make offers of accommodation to support those persons seeking temporary protection in Ireland. The Government is working with the Red Cross on the logistics for putting a national pledge in place.  Arrangements will be finalised shortly and information will be provided for those wishing to pledge accommodation shortly through gov.ie and the Red Cross.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that Ireland will not be found wanting in offering people seeking protection the humanitarian support they will need.</p></reply>

It is also important that adequate consideration be given to requests from survivors and their families for appropriate access and respectful memorialisation. I have been engaging with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage in relation to memorialisation and protection of burial sites that may be linked to former Mother and Baby or County Home Institutions. The Minister established a Working Group last year to advance the relevant actions in the Government Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions. </p></reply>

This funding has the objective of advancing consortia proposals for TU establishment and assists newly established TUs in the post-establishment transition period when these TUs are seeking to embed regionally and deliver on their various legislative functions. A further &euro;30 million allocation will be provided under the Transformation Fund this year. </p><p>In addition, Government has secured &euro;40 million under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan in the period to 2024 for a TU education and training reform programme and is also seeking to secure over &euro;80 million for a TU regional research development and innovation integration (RRDII) programme under the ERDF Co-Funded Regional Programmes 2021-2027. </p><p>A number of TU development consortia and established TUs are also receiving support for new or refurbishment related capital programmes with the assistance of my Department and the Higher Education Authority.

The Programme for Government reflects the importance of supporting learners at risk of education disadvantage and learners with special education needs in higher education.  My Department has taken a range of intitatives to ensure there is increased access to all third level. This includes:  - Abolishing the &euro;200 fee for PLC courses;  - Changes to Student Grant Scheme for the first time in a decade;  - Increasing the visibility of further education and training options to school leavers;  - Increasing the Student Assistance Fund to help students who may be experiencing hardship;  - The development of a new National Access Plan removing specific barriers to people accessing third level;  - The allocation of &euro;10 million for students with disabilities;  - Ringfenced funding to increase participation in third level for the Travelling Community;  - and removing barriers to people living in direct provision accessing student grants.  My Department will continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review.  We want to develop a better understanding of what works best within the different models, and to look at how we can assist people to access and progress through higher and further education and training.  Thus ensuring that we grow prosperity across communities and build social cohesion, while also recognising the different needs of learners and enabling each and every one of them to develop to their full potential.</p></reply>

In 2021 there were a record 8,607 registrations- up from 6,177 for 2019, the last pre-COVID full year, and the highest annual registrations since the 2006 figure of 8,306.</p>  <p>  In 2021, 6,955 registrations were in craft apprenticeships, and largely in the construction sector, which will be vital for realising the ambition set out in Housing for All. There were 1,652 registrations on the newer, post-2016 programmes</p>  <p>  Information on apprenticeship activity received by my Department shows that for the month of January, there were 468 registrations in craft apprenticeship programs. 317 of these apprentices or 68% were aged between 16 and 20 years of age showing a strong uptake in apprenticeships by students.</p>  <p>  In November 2021 information on apprenticeship was included on the CAO website. This initiative is expected to make a significant contribution to highlighting the range of learning and qualification options for school leavers, providing opportunities beyond the more traditional academic path for those who wish to obtain a qualification through different and equally valued means. </p>  <p>  As part of this landmark change, a Freephone helpline has been introduced for learners, parents and guidance counsellors to provide information on apprenticeship, including how to find an employer. The helpline supplements the existing guidance counsellor service at post-primary and further education and training levels. A briefing session for guidance counsellors was also organised by ETBI and SOLAS to provide information on apprenticeship options.  Collectively, these measures mark an important step in increasing awareness of and access to apprenticeship programmes for students.</p></reply>

The income threshold for this grant for the 2021/22 academic year is &euro;24,500. Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270.  </p><p>Alternatively a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;3,500 contribution made towards the cost of his/her fees. The income threshold for this payment is &euro;54,240 for the 2021/22 academic year, increasing relative to the number of family dependents.  </p><p>Budget 2021 provided for enhanced postgraduate supports for the academic year 2021/22 including the fee grant amount rising from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,500 and the income threshold for eligibility for these grants to increase from &euro;31,500, now &euro;54,240.

The student may also wish to discuss his eligibility for SUSI assistance by calling the SUSI Support Desk on 0818 888 777.</p><p>Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), Jobseekers Allowance and Supplementary Welfare allowance payments are administered by the Department of Social Protection (DSP). Further enquiries in respect of these payments or any other social assistance payments that the student may be entitled to should be referred to DSP.  </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, in July 2020 I announced a funding package of &euro;168m for the return to education which included a &euro;10m access support package for higher education students. I approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The SAF assists students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.  </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Further information on this tax relief is available from  a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>. </p></reply>

The new Employer Grant is funded in Budget 2022 and will see annual payments to employers of &euro;2,000 per apprentice for those apprenticeships which are not eligible for the payment of off-the-job training allowances. Its introduction means that, for the first time, employers of all apprentices will now have access to some level of financial support, either through direct payment of allowances to apprentices or through the employer grant. The grant is effective from January 2022. </p><p>The scheme does not specifically exclude local authorities, subject to the bodies meeting the terms of the scheme, including SOLAS authorisation requirements for apprentice employers. </p><p>For example, employers must be approved by SOLAS in advance of employing apprentices, and need to demonstrate that they can provide quality, relevant, on-the-job training for the targeted apprenticeship(s). </p><p>The grant can be claimed by the employer in line with de minimis State Aid regulations for each eligible apprentice for the duration of their apprenticeship. This includes apprentices who were registered during the period 2019-2021 and who continue in employment as of 1<sup>st</sup>January 2022. Two payment points are planned per year, in June and December.</p><p>Eligible employers do not need to do anything as they will be contacted by the National Apprenticeship Office in May/June and invited to submit their claim online. </p><p>New apprenticeships introduced in 2022 and subsequent years will also be included in the grant scheme.</p><p>Further details can be found on <i>www.apprenticeship.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The student grant means test for 2022 is based on gross reckonable income for the 2021 tax year.  </p><p>As the Department of Social Protection state pension payment was not increased in Budget 2021, the special rate income threshold remains at &euro;24,500 for the 2022 Scheme. The income threshold for the special rate of grant is strategically aligned with the highest Department of Social Protection rate as described in order to target students from households in receipt of long term social welfare assistance effectively. However, the special rate of grant payment itself was increased by &euro;200 as part of Budget 2022, along with all other student grant rates. For the 2022/23 academic year, the special rate of grant is payable at the non-adjacent rate of &euro;6,115 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,575, depending on the distance from ordinary residence to the college attended. </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.  </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Since 2014, yearly graduates from HEA-funded higher education institutions have increased by 22%, from 66,500 in 2014 to 81,400 in 2020. Projections of enrolment at third level predict that full-time student enrolments will rise a further 13% over the next decade, and work is ongoing to build capacity within the system to accommodate this increase.</p>  <p>  My officials are working with the Higher Education Authority and with the higher education sector to examine where additional undergraduate places can and should be provided in the higher education system for the next academic year. Any additional places created this year will be targeted at areas of acute skills need as identified through our national skills architecture. The introduction of additional places should also be sustainable and aligned with medium term planning. There are challenges in expanding the facilities, lecturing expertise and clinical and other placements associated with particular courses and, to the extent that these can be overcome, sustainable approaches are required.  </p>  <p>  While increasing places in higher education in a targeted way is an important policy response, it is only one part of the answer.  It is just as important to ensure that all learners have access to the right courses for them, across the spectrum of provision. This year, Leaving Certificate students can find information about their further education and apprenticeship options, as well as their higher education options, at cao.ie/options. I encourage any Leaving Certificate students who are feeling worried or uncertain about their future educational journey to consider all the options available to them.</p>  <p>  The mainstream supply of graduates is supplemented with more targeted initiatives designed to meet specific skills needs.  The two key national targeted initiatives in the higher education system are Springboard+ and the Human Capital Initiative. There is a combined total of 13,444 places on 408 courses available in the 2021/22 academic year under these initiatives.</p></reply>

These include policies designed to ensure a pipeline of suitably qualified science and technical graduates, and initiatives to equip young people and the working population more generally with the skills and capacity to meet these demands. These strategies and initiatives include: the National Skills Strategy 2025; Technology Skills 2022; Springboard+; the Human Capital Initiative and the July Stimulus package. Some of the courses funded under Springboard+ in 2021/22 were in areas such as biopharmaceutical manufacturing and processing, medical technologies and biomedical engineering.</p>  <p>  The number of students studying STEM at third level has been growing, with the number of yearly graduates in the field of natural sciences, mathematics and statistics increasing by almost 1,500 between 2015 and 2020, from 5,220 to 6,710. My Department will continue to engage with the Department of Education on their STEM Education Policy Statement to ensure that learners are given every opportunity to engage with the sciences, and ensure that pipeline of suitably qualified medical science graduates is maintained. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government reflects the importance of supporting learners at risk of education disadvantage and learners with special education needs in higher education. </p>  <p>  My Department has taken a range of intitatives to ensure there is increased access to all third level. This includes: - Abolishing the &euro;200 fee for PLC courses; - Changes to reckobable income limits and grants rates under the Student Grant Scheme for the first time in a decade; - Increasing the visibility of further education and training options to school leavers; - Increasing the Student Assistance Fund to help students who may be experiencing hardship; - The development of a new National Access Plan removing specific barriers to people accessing third level which is at advanced stageof preparation;  -  strategic initiatives to support students with disabilities; - Ringfenced funding to increase participation in third level for the Travelling Community; - And enhancements for students in the international protection process under the student support scheme. My Department will continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review. We want to develop a better understanding of what works best within the different models, and to look at how we can assist people to access and progress through higher and further education and training. Thus ensuring that we grow prosperity across communities and build social cohesion, while also recognising the different needs of learners and enabling each and every one of them to develop to their full potential.</p></reply>

It is, of course, also critical that graduates acquire technical and transversal skills, and that our talent pipeline meets these dual and complementary needs.</p>  <p>  The development of skills policy and responses to skills needs is evidence based and informed by the work of the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SOLAS) and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs in relation to the supply of and demand for occupational skills.</p>  <p>  We know that in a dynamic economy and labour market there will be skills gaps. The imperative is to ensure that our skills forecasting and delivery system is proactive in assessing and responding to the existing and emerging skills needs in our economy and society.  My Department&rsquo;s skills policies continue to be developed taking account of &lsquo;mega-trends&rsquo; impacting on labour demand including digitalisation, automation and climate change. </p>  <p>  Looking forward, I launched the OECD Skills Strategy Project in November 2021. Our work with the OECD includes a comprehensive examination of the National Skills Strategy and approach - in order to ensure that we have a solid foundation on which to build Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and support economic and social sustainability into the future. The project is rooted in partnership - extensive consultations are underway with key partners in the skills ecosystem at both national and regional level, and including via Extraordinary Meetings of the National Skills Council, taking place on 7th and 8th March.</p>  <p>  Further Education and Training (FET) is primarily delivered or contracted by the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) under the funding and strategic direction of SOLAS, the Further Education and Training Authority. FET provision includes both labour market focused programmes and programmes with a strong social inclusion dimension at levels 1-6 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). FET aims to deliver quality programmes, well aligned with learner needs and labour market requirements, to deliver the best possible employment, progression and personal development results for learners. </p>  <p>  The Skills to Advance initiative, which was launched by SOLAS in 2018 and is delivered through the ETBs, is also a key part of the strategic response to the changing world of work. It aims to equip employees with the skills to progress in their current job, or to take advantage of new job opportunities. Targeting support for vulnerable groups in the workforce, it also supports SMEs who need assistance to invest in and develop their workforces. </p>  <p>  The SOLAS Skills to Compete initiative prioritises the reskilling and retraining of those unable to return to their previous employment following the pandemic. Skills to Compete focuses on transversal skills development to help employability, building the digital capabilities now required for almost every job, and specific Level 4-6 courses targeting growth sectors and occupation, including ICT programming; software development and web developers.</p>  <p>  Skillnet Ireland is enterprise-led and supports the promotion and facilitation of workforce learning to sustain Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth and national competitiveness. Every learning network funded by Skillnet Ireland is a cluster of companies from the same sector or geographical location. The Skillnet Ireland model facilitates companies to actively participate in determining their own training needs and how, when and where training will be facilitated. There are also a number of specific networks in the STEM area through Skillnet Ireland, including the Technology Ireland Digital Skillnet.</p>  <p>  The Adult Literacy for Life (ALL) Strategy, a 10 year adult literacy, numeracy and digital literacy strategy published in 2021, sets out a cross-government, cross-economy, cross-society approach to achieve the vision of an Ireland where every adult has the necessary literacy, numeracy and digital literacy to engage in society and realise their potential. One of the stated targets set out in the ALL Strategy is ensuring that 80% of adults have at least basic digital skills by 2030.</p>  <p>  Across Higher Education, existing programmes to encourage participation in STEM careers include Springboard+ and Human Capital Initiative (HCI) Pillar 1. </p>  <p>  Springboard+ complements the core State-funded education and training system and provides free and subsidised upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills need. The initiative&rsquo;s primary target group are unemployed people with a previous history of employment. Over recent years with the decline in numbers on the live register the focus was changed to include more people in employment and those returning to the workforce. </p>  <p>  Courses remain free for unemployed, returners and those in employment participating at level 6 of the NFQ. Employed people participating on courses at levels 7 and above in the NFQ contribute 10% of the course cost, with the remainder being funded by the Government.</p>  <p>  Human Capital Initiative Pillar 1 provides for Graduate Conversion Courses in a range of courses, building on the experience from ICT Conversion Courses under Springboard.</p>  <p>  Under Springboard+ 2021, 11,642 places are being provided on 330 courses.  In 2021/22, HCI Pillar 1 is providing funding to create 2,204 target conversion course places, including 780 places in ICT courses. As a result of multi-annual funding of graduate conversion courses, this leads to a combined total of 13,846 places in 408 courses available in the 2021/22 academic year under Springboard+ 2021 and HCI Pillar 1. There is a broad range of courses, including courses in areas of new and emerging technologies such as Cybersecurity and Virtual Reality. Almost 64% of course places are in STEM-related areas. The Springboard+ 2022 call for proposals was launched in December 2021. Springboard+ 2022 is due to launch in Q2 2022.</p>  <p>  In relation to research, the 6 Science Foundation Ireland Centres for Research Training, established in 2019, will provide cohort-based PhD training for over 700 postgraduate students under the theme of Data and ICT Skills for the Future. Students are being recruited in 4 cohorts &ndash; the third group commenced in 2021 - and  collaboration is at the core, with over 90 academics and over 40 companies, to ensure we can meet the  future skills needed in these critically important areas.</p></reply>

It is also a worthwhile policy goal in its own right, given all that we know about the importance of diversity in STEM, as well as our desire to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to pursue courses of study that will interest and engage them, and give them the skills to pursue a productive career.</p>  <p>  This is an issue which requires action at all stages of the educational and career journey.  Getting a good gender balance in the higher education system is an issue that depends on people being engaged and interested in STEM at a much earlier stage in their education.</p>  <p>  The STEM Education Policy Statement was published by the Department of Education in 2017 and seeks to raise awareness and interest in STEM. The first pillar of the strategy is "Nurturing learner engagement and participation" and focuses on increasing the uptake of STEM related subjects for learners of all backgrounds, ability and gender. The strategy targets a 40% increase in the number of females taking STEM subjects for Leaving Certificate.</p>  <p>  At present, the gender balance in higher education among students studying natural sciences, mathematics and statistics is almost equal, with women accounting for 53% of these students. However there is further progress to be made in fields such as engineering and ICT which have only 22% and 20% female enrolments at present. I will continue to work to a further and higher education system where every individual is empowered to develop their full potential.</p>  <p>  More widely, the promotion of gender equality in higher education is also critical.  This is an area that I have prioritised, including through support for initiatives including the National Gender Equality Dashboard for Higher Education Institutions; the Athena SWAN Charter and the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative which is increasing the number of women involved in decision making roles in higher education.  </p></reply>

In June 2021, I wrote to the Presidents of the Higher Education Institutions to request their support and participation in two surveys by researchers at the specialist DCU Anti-Bullying Centre, with the support of my Department. </p><p>The first survey was conducted in late 2021 and focused on work-related experiences of staff in Irish higher education institutions. A report is currently being prepared which I intend to publish in the coming weeks. The second survey will focus on student experiences of bullying and cyberbullying and will be conducted in 2022. By documenting the experiences and recommendations of students and staff, the surveys will inform the development of strong policies and practices in higher education institutions to tackle and eradicate inappropriate behaviours in the learning environment and workplace. </p><p>On 18 October 2021, I launched 'Speak Out - the Anonymous Violence and Harassment Reporting Tool' for higher education institutions. Speak Out is an online and anonymous reporting platform for incidents of:</p><p>- bullying</p><p>- cyberbullying</p><p>- harassment</p><p>- discrimination</p><p>- hate crime</p><p>- coercive behaviour or control</p><p>- stalking</p><p>- assault</p><p>- sexual harassment</p><p>- sexual assault</p><p>- rape</p><p>The creation of this innovative and supportive online platform will provide a safe and anonymous medium for students and staff to report incidents of bullying, assault or sexual violence in a trauma-informed environment. These are issues that my department is acutely aware of, and I am delighted we could provide funding for this vital project.</p><p>Speak Out represents a national approach to tackling these issues by raising awareness, and by providing a means of recording instances, which will assist in achieving a zero-tolerance culture.</p><p>The project will be rolled out across 18 higher education institutions throughout this academic year for students, staff and visitors. The Psychological Counsellors in Higher Education Ireland (PCHEI) is leading the project. The data collected through this tool will be used to inform policy and targeted educational initiatives. It is the goal of PCHEI to provide a trauma-informed tool which will provide users with support services relevant to their experience.</p><p>This project is a ground-breaking initiative which is underpinned by an ethos of cross-institutional collaboration in response to such incidences within higher education institutions.</p></reply>

The market for innovation and research is also global &ndash; international cooperation in research and innovation plays an important role in the development and sustainability of a world-class innovation and research system.</p>  <p>  The centrality of the higher education and research systems in the innovation ecosystem and the availability of high-quality talent from the tertiary education system are core to Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position. The availability and quality of graduates is essential if we are to maintain our attractiveness as a location for investment and grow our reputation as a destination for a successful research career.</p>  <p>  In last year's European Innovation Scoreboard, in which Ireland was ranked the 11th most innovative Member State in the EU, Ireland performed well with its skilled workforce. Ireland came 5th overall and higher than the EU average in the Human Resources dimension, which measures the availability of a high-skilled and educated workforce. Within this, Ireland was 7th for New Doctorate Graduates, 3rd for Population completed tertiary education (aged 25-34) and 9th for Lifelong Learning.</p>  <p>  Through engagement in bilateral cooperation, via research and innovation agreements, we build innovation capacity, facilitate researcher mobility, and allow for economies of scale. Our research funders in different sectors engage in international cooperation to seek to influence European and international agendas and also to assist developing countries in addressing their challenges. The manifold benefits of international engagement accrue not only to our researchers but also to our enterprise base and to our public policy makers.</p>  <p>  I and my Department are determined to be the driver of a vibrant sector which produces individuals who are equipped with the skills that they need to progress in the way that they want to, and in a way that meets the needs of our evolving economy and contributes to an inclusive society. Not only will these individuals be equipped with expertise in research and innovation but I am also determined that the sector will continue to embrace and embed innovation in how it delivers and operates.</p>  <p>  As international competition for talent, investment and innovation grows more intense as nations strive to improve their standing as knowledge based economies, the establishment of my Department focused on talent and knowledge is an indication of the Government&rsquo;s intent to position human capital and research as key enablers for our future economy and society.</p></reply>

Inclusion is a key goal in my Department's Statement of Strategy.</p>  <p>  It is important to state the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 (NAP) set targets to increase participation in higher education by people with disabilities. Specific targets have been set to increase participation in higher education by students with physical or sensory disabilities. The original (8%) and revised target (12%) under the National Access Plan of new entrants to higher education with disabilities has now been exceeded, with 12.2% of new entrants to higher education in 2019/20 declaring a disability. </p>  <p>  However, we acknowledge more needs to be done. Work on the development of the next National Access Plan (NAP) 2022 - 2026 is well advance. One-to-one stakeholder meetings around the specific target groups to be supported for the period of the next NAP have almost concluded. Colleagues in my Department are working closely with the HEA on the development of the new Plan with the intention of publishing the plan in early 2022. An additional &euro;5million has been set aside for this plan.</p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education. &euro;9.6m is allocated to the Fund annually for both Further and Higher Education. In 2019/2020, circa 16,000 students were supported through the fund. </p>  <p>  In January 2021, I approved a number of strategic projects under the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. The initiatives, which involve 24 higher education institutions (HEI) and &euro;5.8m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development. Among the projects are a number of projects for students with autism including the establishment of autism friendly rooms across nine different campuses, the development of assistive technology including for students with disabilities, an app to help students with visual or hearing impairment navigate their way around campus and specialist assistance for students who are deaf.</p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available in the FET sector for learners with a disability, as well as provision of specific programmes for learners with a disability who may require more intensive supports through Specialist Training Provision. Guidelines for practitioners in relation to implementing a Universal Design for Learning, or UDL, approach in the FET sector were published by SOLAS last year, and this approach aims to reduce obstacles to learning by taking into account the needs of learners of diverse backgrounds and abilities.</p>  <p>  The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including for learners with a disability.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review. We want to develop a better understanding of what works best within the different models, and to look at how we can assist people to access and progress through higher and further education and training. Thus ensuring that we grow prosperity across communities and build social cohesion, while also recognising the different needs of learners and enabling each and every one of them to develop to their full potential. </p></reply>

Courses are generally one to two years in duration, are delivered all year round and lead to accreditation at levels 1-6 on the NFQ. Course examples include ICT and vocational multi-skills. STPs can provide a number of enhanced services for its learners including additional training duration; adapted equipment; transport arrangements; enhanced programme content which may be required for a person with a disability to achieve their potential. An enhanced trainer-learner ratio is available on these programmes. STP is currently contracted out by the 16 Education and Training Boards, ETBs, around the country. There are currently 29 National Learning Network centres delivering STP, and an additional 15 independent providers.</p><p>Outside of STP provision, there are no specific courses in the FET sector aimed at people with an intellectual disability. However, the FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including for learners with an intellectual disability. There are range of supports available in the FET sector for learners with an intellectual disability, and the ETB will discuss with the learner their needs and suitability for the selected course requirements. Also, to further improve inclusion in the FET sector, guidelines for practitioners in relation to implementing a Universal Design for Learning, or UDL, approach in the FET sector were published by SOLAS last year, and this approach aims to reduce obstacles to learning by taking into account the needs of learners of diverse backgrounds and abilities.</p><p>Ten Higher Education Institutions provide follow-on courses. These include the following:</p><p>- DCU</p><p>- DKIT</p><p>- IADT</p><p>- LIT</p><p>- MIC</p><p>- MTU Cork</p><p>- TCD</p><p>- TU Dublin &ndash; Blanchardstown</p><p>- TU Dublin &ndash; Tallaght</p><p>- UCC</p><p>Course examples in HEIs is to enable the learner with an intellectual disability to develop relevant knowledge and competence and to be able to use a range of skills under supervision. It also helps them to develop a lifelong learning ethos with the promotion of inclusion to third level education.</p><p>I will shortly be launching a new National Access Plan which will have ambitious targets for representation of people who are under-represented in higher education.  This Plan will focus on improving the learning experience and success of learners. The new plan<b></b>will include specific supports for persons with disabilities, including those with intellectual disabilities.</p></reply>

My Department is strongly committed to supporting the health of the population through the provision of graduates with the key competencies and skills to be effective in the health workforce, and support a range of clinical teams in our health services. My officials are actively engaging with the Department of Health on determining the longer term skills needs of the healthcare services, and the role which the further and higher education sector can play in meeting those skills needs.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above Higher education institution are autonomous bodies as set out in legislation, as such the management of the academic affairs, including the curriculum and instruction and education provided are generally matters for the relevant HEI.</p><p>My Department allocates funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to designated HEIs.  The HEA provides block grant funding to the Higher Education Sector through the Recurrent Grant Allocation Model (RGAM), which is driven by student numbers. The grant is allocated as a block grant and the internal allocation is a matter for each institution. The RGAM core funding is exclusive of fees.</p><p>As referenced in the Deputy's question TU Dublin (formerly DIT) provides a 4-year honours degree (NFQ level 8) programme BSc (Hons) in Optometry (DT224). Within the HEA's RGAM students on the TU Dublin Optometry programme are weighted in the laboratory category and this weighted number is included in the annual core funding. </p><p>In its student record submission to the HEA for 2021 funding, TU Dublin reported 86.25 Full Time Equivalents students registered on DT224 programme. The laboratory weighting of 1.7 applies. The standard unit of resource in the 2021 grant was &euro;3,344 in the Technological sector and thus TU Dublin were allocated core funding in respect of the Bachelor of Science (Hons) Optometry as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>Total FTE equivalent students</th>       <th>Weighting </th>       <th>Total Weighted Students</th>       <th>Technological sector Standard Resource 2021</th>       <th>Total Funding Included in core RGAM grant</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bachelor of Science (Hons) Optometry DT224</td>       <td>86.25 </td>       <td>1.7 </td>       <td>146.625 </td>       <td>&euro;3,344 </td>       <td>&euro;490,314 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It is anticipated that should other publicly funded Higher Education Institution's introduce a similar Optometry course that recurrent funding would be provided on a similar basis to that outlined above with additional funding in respect of free fees eligible students provided.  At this time the HEA as confirmed that it has not received such a request. </p></reply>

Stamp 4 conditions permit non-EEA nationals to work, study or start their own businesses in Ireland.

They tell the victim that they are not safe simply because of who they are. They send the disgusting message to victims that they and people like them are somehow lesser than the rest of us which is unacceptable. </p>  <p>  These crimes are motivated by prejudice. They make victims feel afraid for their future, their friends and their families. They lead to a divided society, where whole communities can feel unsafe and angry. It&rsquo;s important that we recognize the true harm of these crimes and ensure that our legislative framework can tackle them.</p>  <p>  In November of 2020 I announced my intention to bring forward new legislation to combat incitement to hatred and hate crime in Ireland. This announcement followed on from the publication of the results of a widespread consultation process, which included in-depth consultations with various civil society and community groups, academics and experts, a public consultation process and a detailed comparative study of approaches to hate crime in five other jurisdictions.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the extensive consultation was to ensure my Department could identify how Ireland&rsquo;s law in this area could be improved, informed by a firm understanding of the lived experience of those impacted by hate incidents. </p>  <p>  In total, the Department received 3,600 survey responses and more than 175 detailed written submissions.</p>  <p>  The conclusions in the report &ndash; which were drawn from submissions provided by experts, professional organisations, community and religious groups, civil society and members of the public &ndash;are being used to develop new legislation to deal with incitement to hatred and hate crime.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that improvements in our criminal legislation will be one element in a wider suite of measures across all areas of Government, which are designed to address hatred and intolerance in all its forms.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2021 was published on 16 April 2021 and it can be accessed on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The Bill will create new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences, where those offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic. The protected characteristics set out in the General Scheme include disability, as well as race; colour; nationality; religion, ethnic or national origin; sexual orientation; and gender. </p>  <p>  I intend to publish the new Hate Crime Bill in the summer. </p>  <p>  I wish to inform the Deputy that I have contacted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for information on the development of guidelines in the service in relation to action 15 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, but they have been unable to furnish me with the information within the allocated timeframe.

This new plan will have a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in our society of domestic violence. There will be a specific objective under the prevention pillar of the new strategy to equip frontline professionals and support staff, including members of the Court Services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the necessary analysis, skills, and expertise to identify potential domestic, sexual and gender-based violence dangers and make appropriate preventative interventions and referrals.</p>  <p>  The Strategy has been developed in partnership with the sector to ensure it is targeted, comprehensive and effective in achieving all of the goals set out. Last month I briefed those working in the sector on the progress of the strategy and launched a wider public consultation. I will publish the final strategy and accompanying action plans in April.</p>  <p>  The specific issue raised by the Deputy is being addressed, both in the new Strategy and also in Supporting a Victim's Journey - my plan to help vulnerable victims and witness through the Courts process.</p>  <p>  One of the objectives under the Protection Pillar of the new strategy is to "ensure professionals/front line workers involved in DSGBV work in the courts, and in the justice, legal and policing systems have the skills and analysis of DSGBV to equip them with the necessary expertise they require". This will be achieved by developing and delivering co-designed, co-ordinated and trauma informed education and awareness initiatives. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service, The Probation Service and the Legal Aid Board are some of the agencies leading this work. </p>  <p>  One of objectives under the Prevention Pillar is to &ldquo;enhance the understanding of adults of all forms of DSGBV and education society to recognise the harm and prevent the human rights abuse that is DSGBV while making clear the pathways to safety and sanctions&rdquo;. Actions in this area include delivering public awareness campaigns, including paths to safety, and raising public awareness of DSGBV in all its forms and across all groups in society.</p>  <p>  Another objective under the Prevention Pillar is to "enable frontline professionals and support staff to have the necessary analysis, skills and expertise to identify potential DSGBV dangers and make appropriate preventative interventions and referrals". Actions here include building on mapping of what Continuous Professional Development currently exists on DSGBV for various professionals and support staff (e.g. medical, social worker, educationalists, legal etc.),  and resourcing and co-designing work with the specialist services to lead and deliver education/CPD programmes on all forms of DSGBV.</p>  <p>  Following publication of Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, my Department established three specific sub-groups to work on implementing some of the recommendations outlined in the plan. One such sub-group was tasked with development of an approach to meeting training needs of a wide range of front-line staff and professionals, including legal professionals.</p>  <p>  This sub-group has meet a number of times since publication of the report. </p>  <p>  The range of training needs underconsideration include training for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, other front-line staff and for legal professionals.</p>  <p>  My Department has engaged a consultant to conduct a mapping exercise to establish what training is already being provided, and in what areas. This exercise has commenced and aims to have a relatively short timeframe for completion so that the development work can begin.</p>  <p>  Following the mapping exercise, evaluation of the effectiveness of current training provision will take place where the sub-group will flesh out what gaps exist, with support from the consultant. A facilitated consultation method will be examined at a later stage when evaluating effectiveness of current training.</p>  <p>  Once these first initial two stages are complete then measures will be put forward as to meet the needs and gaps identified.</p></reply>

They should, however, contact my Department at: citizenshipinfo@justice.ie, if they intend to remain outside of the State for an extended period of time.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  My Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  Last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest level since 2015.  Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

The issue of outdated alcohol licensing legislation was also a key challenge identified by stakeholders in the published report of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce.</p>  <p>  I intend to bring forward a Sale of Alcohol Bill at the earliest opportunity as part of my commitment to enact ambitious licencing reform by the end of 2022. </p>  <p>  Last September, the Government agreed that Heads of a General Scheme of a Bill would be prepared to modernise our licensing laws and I am prioritising this work at present.</p>  <p>  Existing legislation, some of which dates to 1833, does not reflect the dynamic and diverse society that we have become. I intend that the outdated Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018 and the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008 will be repealed and replaced with updated and streamlined provisions more suited to the 21st century. It is also the intention to repeal the Public Dance Hall Act 1935.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that work on the consolidation and reform of the licensing laws and the drafting of the General Scheme is advancing well.  This is a reform on which there are many views across society and the legislation I bring forward needs to be informed by those views. In November last, I launched a wide ranging consultation to seek the views of the public on the modernisation of Ireland&rsquo;s licencing laws. The consultation, which ran until 21 January this year, looked at how best to update the existing laws governing the sale and regulation of alcohol in Ireland. Members of the public, academics, sectoral groups and representative organisations were invited to complete an online survey and/or make a written submission to my Department. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that there was a very high level of public engagement with more than 5,000 responses received, which I think speaks to the importance of this the issues concerned and the range of views in society at large on those issues including regarding the societal and individual harms that can result from abuse of alcohol. My Department is now reviewing these responses to ensure the reform of the legislation takes account of and is informed by this engagement. My Department will also host a stakeholder webinar discussion on 10 March 2022 to give an opportunity for further discussion. The webinar will also be livestreamed across my Department's social media channels. The outcomes of the public consultation process will be published in due course. </p>  <p>  I intend to progress this legislation in the months ahead with a view to enacting it this year. I look forward to working with members of this House to bring about this important reform.</p></reply>

The plan proposes ambitious additional activity levels which will work to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures (scoliosis and spina bifida) by year end.</p>  <p>  This latest initiative is further evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to address the issues facing these children. Both current and capital funding has been provided to a value of &euro;19 million in 2022 to support this initiative.</p>  <p>  More specifically, &euro;3.4 million has been committed to support additional activity at Cappagh Orthopaedic hospital. This is the full year requirement associated with the &euro;1.65 million that was provided from the Access to Care Fund in 2021 to support CHI paediatric orthopaedic activity at Cappagh. Furthermore, &euro;4.7 million has been provided on a recurring basis since 2021 to fund an additional 24 beds at Crumlin and Temple street, and 2 high dependency unit beds at Crumlin. These beds will facilitate the increase in activity needed to reduce paediatric orthopaedic waiting times. A further &euro;4 million has been committed for a theatre expansion programme across CHI sites to focus on paediatric orthopaedics. Capital funding of &euro;4 million has been designated to support this initiative, which is included within the 2022 Capital Plan due to be approved shortly. Finally, &euro;2 million has been provided for outsourcing initiatives for both inpatient and daycase procedures, as well as to meet radiology needs. Plans are currently being finalised by CHI in this regard.</p>  <p>  Some of these figures are initial estimates and as such are subject to final review, agreement and potential revision on receipt of the detailed operational plan for delivery of this important initiative.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites. The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices (eg: nursing homes and hospices that are private, public, section 39, voluntary etc.) that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions. This consultation is part of the Department and HSE&rsquo;s objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly. Upon conclusion of consultations with the trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars shall be published by the HSE. It is intended that payments will be instructed this month, with the payment processed through local payroll thereafter.</p>  <p>  For healthcare workers in private nursing homes and hospices, arrangements for this sector encompassed by this measure are currently being progressed by the Department of Health. As the HSE is not the employer in these instances, the arrangements including payment dates will require further analysis before finalising but it is envisaged that payments will be instructed for these workers in Q2 2022.</p></reply>

The Report sets out current levels of service, models of service provision and the consultation process undertaken with patients, advocates, ophthalmic staff and representative bodies.</p>  <p>  It also highlights the limitations of the current model of service delivery, including the impact on waiting lists, and sets out the way forward for a significant amount of eye services to be delivered in a primary care setting.</p>  <p>  The Report estimates that 60% of existing outpatient activity could be moved to primary care thus enabling hospital services to focus on patients who require more specialist diagnostics or treatments. This Report remains current and the HSE has advised that in 2022 it will advance the transfer of care for children aged 8+ years to local optometrists, thereby reducing waiting lists and enhancing access to primary eye care services.</p>  <p>  A project team was established in late 2019 / early 2020 to progress this initiative with a wide-ranging membership including representation from the Department of Health. However, due to the requirement to focus resources on the Covid-19 pandemic it was necessary to pause the programme.</p>  <p>  There is now a commitment to progressing the project through the reconvening of the project team. It is anticipated that it will be possible to bring the project to conclusion over a six to nine-month time frame.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 did not include a specific funding allocation for this project and HSE advances in this regard will be achieved in the context of the resources that have been allocated to the Executive.</p></reply>

Its remit is to advise the HSE and the Department of Health in relation to the cost-effectiveness of medicines, through the carrying out of health technology assessments (HTAs).</p>  <p>  The NCPE's workload has increased significantly in recent years, from fewer than 10 assessments per year in 2007 to 98 assessments in 2021. In addition, the complexity of individual assessments has increased.</p>  <p>  Following an independent review of the NCPE's work in 2017, an additional &euro;750,000 was allocated by the Minister for Health in 2018 to support the working of the NCPE, increasing its staffing from 10.5 to 20.5 WTEs.</p>  <p>  The NCPE advises that cancer drugs account for 33% of the NCPE's rapid reviews and 50% of full Health Technology Assessments (HTAs).

Given the complexities involved in such assessments, these timelines can be considered within expectations.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving an application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p></reply>

The HSE and NCPE have indicated that such a process would be founded upon the assumption that the collected data would support a positive reimbursement recommendation, which is often not the case.</p><p>It is clear from an analysis of trends over the last few years that the overriding factor in the approval of medicines for reimbursement is the availability of Exchequer resources.</p><p>-  In 2020 there was no dedicated funding allocated for new drugs and the HSE approved 11 new medicines / new uses of existing medicines in the area of cancer treatment. This represents 48% of all approvals that year.

It is estimated that in the region of 97 new indications will receive market authorisation in Europe each year over the next 5 years.  This of course poses a funding challenge in the context of the many competing demands on the Exchequer.  This challenge will be ameliorated to a degree by the two new Framework Agreements on Pricing and Supply of Medicines finalised late in 2021. The multiannual agreements, with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and Medicines for Ireland (MFI) respectively, represent an important step in reducing the cost of medicines and facilitating access to innovative new medicines for patients for the years 2021 to 2025.</p>  <p>  The dedicated funding of &euro;30m provided for new medicines in Budget 2022 will facilitate access for patients to new medicines, including those for rare diseases. The HSE and National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) advise that there are currently a significant number of new drugs currently undergoing assessment. The HSE will robustly assess all of these in line with the criteria contained in the Health Act 2013.</p></reply>

Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p><p>In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).</p><p>The HSE received an application for pricing / reimbursement of Liraglutide (Saxenda&reg;) on the 17<sup>th</sup>September 2019 from Novo Nordisk (the applicant) as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adult patients with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m&sup2; (obesity), or ≥27 kg/m&sup2; to &amp;lt;30 kg/m&sup2; (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity such as dysglycaemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus), hypertension, dyslipidaemia or obstructive sleep apnoea.</p><p>The HSE commissioned a rapid review process on the 18<sup>th</sup>September 2019. Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) advised the HSE (24<sup>th</sup>October 2019) that a full Health Technology Assessment (HTA) was required for this medicine. The HSE commissioned a full Health Technology Assessment on the 29<sup>th</sup>October 2019 as per agreed processes.</p><p>The NCPE Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report was received by the HSE on the 10<sup>th</sup>February 2021. The NCPE recommended that Liraglutide (Saxenda&reg;) not be considered for reimbursement unless cost effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments. The HTA was conducted in a defined subgroup of the full licensed indication, namely Liraglutide (Saxenda&reg;) as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adult patients with a body mass index of ≥35kg/m<sup>2</sup>with pre-diabetes and high risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>The HSE Corporate Pharmaceutical Unit (CPU) is the interface between the HSE and the Pharmaceutical Industry in relation to medicine pricing and reimbursement applications. CPU engaged in commercial negotiations with Novo Nordisk in March 2021 regarding their application for Liraglutide (Saxenda&reg;). Novo Nordisk confirmed their intent to pursue reimbursement for a defined subgroup of the full licensed indication, namely as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adult patients with a body mass index of ≥35kg/m<sup>2</sup>with pre-diabetes and high risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>The Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members. Liraglutide (Saxenda&reg;) was considered by the Drugs Group in September 2021. The final HTA report was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial negotiations, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE Drugs Group made a recommendation to support reimbursement of Liraglutide (Saxenda&reg;) as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adult patients with a body mass index of ≥35kg/m<sup>2</sup>with pre-diabetes and high risk of cardiovascular disease. The positive recommendation is conditional on the implementation of a managed access programme.</p><p>The decision making authority in the HSE is the HSE Executive Management Team. The HSE Executive Management Team decides on the basis of all the demands it is faced with (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new use of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The HSE EMT considered the recommendation of the Drugs Group and subsequently supported reimbursement of Liraglutide (Saxenda&reg;) under the Community Drugs Schemes.</p><p>As a condition of reimbursement, an individual patient approval system will now be implemented by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) to enable reimbursement for patients who meet the pre-defined criteria as per a Medicines Management Programme (MMP) devised managed access programme. The processes necessary to implement this required managed access programme (MAP) are currently being developed by the HSE MMP along with relevant internal stakeholders.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 waiting list action plan, which was launched on the 26<sup>th</sup>of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists by 18% this year which will bring the number of people waiting to their lowest point in five years</p><p>Projections for 2022 show that over 1.5 million patients will be added to active waiting lists this year. Many people stayed away from the health service during the pandemic and, as these people come forward for treatment it will place huge additional demand on health services.</p><p>Under this plan the Department HSE and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity to treat 1.7 million people as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan focuses on 15 high volume inpatient day case procedures, including cataracts and hip and knee replacements, so that every person waiting over 6 months for one of these procedures, and who is clinically ready will receive an offer of treatment.  </p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Draft regulations under section 13 are currently being developed.  </p>  <p>  The process in relation to the draft regulations under section 12 is that Ireland is required to notify the draft to the European Commission under the Single Market Transparency Directive (EU) 2015/1535. Once notified, a 3-month standstill period is triggered during which the Commission and other Member States assess the draft rules in the context of Single Market principles. </p>  <p>  This Directive enables the Commission, EU Member States and participating countries to react to any potential barriers to the free movement of products and the provision of information society services and reactions can take one of the following forms:</p>  <p>  - The Commission, the EU Member States and the other participating countries can issue &lsquo;comments&rsquo; to be taken into account by the country that has notified a draft rule or rules, if      the notified draft needs to be adjusted.</p>  <p>  - The Commission and EU Member States can also send the notifying Member State a &lsquo;detailed opinion&rsquo; if a serious concern is identified. This extends the standstill period and opens a dialogue phase with the notifying country. The potential barrier identified can thus be effectively addressed.</p>  <p>  - If an EU proposal in the same area is in the pipeline, the Commission can take a &lsquo;blocking decision&rsquo; to postpone the adoption of the national measure.</p>  <p>  In relation to section 13 of the Act, Ireland is required to notify the draft advertising regulations to the European Commission under the Food Information to Consumers Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011. This Regulation establishes the general principles, requirements and responsibilities governing food information and in particular food labelling.</p>  <p>  On receipt of the notification, the Commission shall consult the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health if it considers such consultation to be useful or if a Member State so requests. The Member State notifying the draft regulations may take the envisaged measures only 3 months after the notification, provided that it has not received a negative opinion from the Commission. However, if the Commission&rsquo;s opinion is negative, and before the expiry of the 3 month period, the Commission shall initiate an examination procedure in order to determine whether the envisaged measures may be implemented subject, if necessary, to the appropriate modifications.</p></reply>

Approximately,1,150 private dentists continue to hold a contract with the HSE for the provision of dental services to medical card holders, but that number is down about 300 since the start of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  In that respect, officials from my Department and from the HSE have held three rounds of discussions with the Irish Dental Association, the most recent on 2nd March when my Department and the HSE presented proposals to invest additional resources in the Dental Treatment Services Scheme, including &euro;10m provided in the Budget, on top of the 2022 Estimate allocation of &euro;56 million.</p>  <p>  The Department / HSE has offered increased fees across a number of items and proposed the reintroduction of the Scale and Polish item. The Department is anxious to move the process on, in the interests of patients. </p>  <p>  Under the recently published Department of Health waiting list plan initiative for 2022, &euro;11 million in funding is to be made available for identified community initiatives, with a focus on orthodontics, primary care psychology and counselling in primary care. A further &euro;9m is also included in the plan to support priority community areas with activity levels to be determined. Funding for these community areas will need to be specifically used to support additionality not currently funded through the HSE National Service Plan.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the HSE commenced a new procurement that allows patients to have treatment with private Specialist Orthodontists. It replaces the previous procurement that ended in 2020. Under the new procurement the first patients were allocated to private Specialist Orthodontists in Q3 of 2021.  By the end of 2021, 870 patients had commenced treatment under these arrangements.  </p>  <p>  The allocation of patients to private Specialist Orthodontists is continuing in 2022 and the HSE approved an orthodontic treatment waiting list initiative for Quarter 1 of 2022 that will see 750 Children and Young People assessed as Grade 4 who have been waiting over 4 years for treatment at a cost of &euro;2.8m. In January, 261 children and young people have been taken off the orthodontics waiting list using private providers under this new procurement framework. The HSE are likely ready to commence the approval process in the coming weeks to continue the orthodontics waiting list initiative to the end of the year. </p></reply>

I am confident that this investment will continue to improve diagnosis and access to services for people with dementia across the country, enabling people with dementia to live well for as long as possible.</p><p>The additional funding will allow for a range of measures to enhance services and supports for people with dementia. These services include:</p><p>- 5 new memory assessment and support services and one new regional specialist memory clinic in Galway</p><p>- Specialist diagnostic services for people with an intellectual disability through the National Intellectual Disability Memory Service in Tallaght University Hospital</p><p>- Enhancement of memory technology resource rooms to demonstrate assistive technology options for people living with dementia</p><p>- Implementation of a dementia minimum dataset across all care settings to standardise data collection and reporting</p><p>- 6 dementia assistant director of nursing posts (one in each hospital group) to improve quality and safety of care for people with dementia</p><p>- 4 additional dementia clinical nurse specialists to improve care pathways in acute care settings </p><p>- Undertake the third wave of the Irish National Audit of Dementia in acute hospitals</p><p>- Promote brain health and reduce the prevalence and delay the onset of dementia through collaboration with clinical programmes, the understand together campaign and dementia risk reduction group through the provision of a brain health project manager</p><p>In addition, the Government is committed to the development of improved community-based services, shifting care to the home, and offering greater choice for older people including people living with dementia. As Minister with responsibility for this area I have prioritised home support services so that additional funding secured in Budget 2021 to provide an extra 5 million hours has been maintained under Budget 2022.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term residential care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p><p>One of the key principles of the scheme is that nobody will pay more than the actual cost of their care, and a participant will only pay for the amount of time they actually spend in care.</p><p>All participants within the NHSS contribute up to 80% of their income (40% if part of a couple) and 7.5% per annum of the value of their assets (3.25% if part of a couple). The first &euro;36,000 (&euro;72,000 if part of a couple) is excluded from assessment. For the purposes of financial assessment, income includes:</p><p>-  Earnings, including income from farming or business activities</p><p>-  Pension income</p><p>-  Social welfare benefits/allowances</p><p>-  Rental income</p><p>-  Income from holding an office or directorship</p><p>-  Income from fees, commissions, dividends or interest</p><p>-  Any income which you have deprived yourself of in the five years prior to application.</p><p>The financial assessment will also establish the value of non-cash assets such as the principal private residence, other property and land, including farmland.</p><p>The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three-year cap, which is intended to protect the value of a principal private residence, along with the other safeguards built into the Financial Assessment which ensure that</p><p>-  Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;</p><p>-  A participant will keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater, and;</p><p>-  If a participant has a spouse or partner remaining at home, they will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</p><p>Provisions exist in the legislation to allow certain deductions from the financial assessment when calculating an applicant&rsquo;s contribution to care. The definition of &lsquo;Allowable Deduction&rsquo; in relation to income as per the legislation includes the following:</p><p>(i) income tax required by law to be deducted or paid from income</p><p>(ii) social insurance contributions</p><p>(iii) levies required by law to be paid</p><p>(iv) payments in respect of interest on monies borrowed for the purchase, repair or improvement of the principal private residence of the person </p><p>(v) health expenses to which Section 469 of Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 applies</p><p>(vi) payments in respect of the maintenance of a child, a spouse or a former spouse under a separate agreement less the amount of any relief from income tax which may be claimed in respect of such payments</p><p>(vii) certain qualifying redress schemes.</p><p>(The above should be read in conjunction with the Legislation and the National Guidelines. The full text of the legislation can be accessed by following this link:  )</p><p>Last year, the Department of Health introduced the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021, which became operational in October. This introduced a three-year cap on contributions from family farm and business assets, provided that certain conditions are met. The Act also extended the three-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a principal residence.</p></reply>

The design of information and publicity campaigns to support and promote the roll out of the scheme will be finalised in the coming months.  </p><p>The capacity within the health system to fit and remove LARCs was examined by the Working Group on Contraception; the Report is available on the Department's website. At time of publication in 2019, there were over 1,000 GPs holding LARC certification and that there was scope for enabling practitioners to develop their skills further by promoting further integration between the hospital and community sector and developing local centres of expertise in sexual and reproductive health services. </p><p>As part of the Budget 2022 allocation, funds are being made available for additional training capacity with respect to certification of medical professionals to fit and remove LARCs.

They further advised that there will be an ongoing requirement to be able to scale up appropriate responses quickly should they be required.</p><p>While mask wearing is no longer mandatory in certain settings including primary and post-primary school settings, the NPHET recommended that masks should still be worn in healthcare settings, and their use should continue to be advised on public transport where physical distancing can be difficult and where those who are more vulnerable to the severe impacts of COVID-19 do not always have discretion to avoid.</p><p>The Department of Health will continue to give clear guidance and communication to the public on the evolving disease profile as well as supporting a cultural shift towards embedding individual and collective personal behaviours to mitigate against COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.</p><p>The NPHET letters to the Minister for Health are available to read at .</p><p>You may wish to note that guidance around the wearing of face coverings in schools falls under the remit of the Department of Education.</p></reply>

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites. The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices (eg: nursing homes and hospices that are private, public, section 39, voluntary etc.) that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions. This consultation is part of the Department and HSE&rsquo;s objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly. Upon conclusion of consultations with the trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars shall be published by the HSE. It is intended that payments will be instructed this month, with the payment processed through local payroll thereafter.</p>  <p>  For healthcare workers in private nursing homes and hospices, arrangements for this sector encompassed by this measure are currently being progressed by the Department of Health. As the HSE is not the employer in these instances, the arrangements including payment dates will require further analysis before finalising but it is envisaged that payments will be instructed for these workers in Q2 2022.</p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Delta and Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 26th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list plan, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The data requested by the Deputy regarding the number of women awaiting gynaecology appointments by hospital in tabular form and the average waiting time for a gynaecology appointment by hospital in 2021 and to date in 2022 is outlined in the attached document. The NTPF has advised my Department that the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times.

The payment of &euro;1,000 will not be subject to income tax, USC, or PRSI. The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021.</p>  <p>  Those public sector frontline healthcare workers eligible for the payment will be directly employed public health sector staff working in clinical settings. A pro-rata arrangement will apply for eligible part time staff / equivalents and supernumerary students who were required to perform training in clinical sites. The Department of Health will also introduce a measure for making a similar payment to staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices (eg: nursing homes and hospices that are private, public, section 39, voluntary etc.) that were affected by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE continue to engage in finalising arrangements to give effect to the Government announcement concerning the Recognition Payment.</p>  <p>  Full particulars, eligibility and terms and conditions that apply to this payment shall be made available shortly. It is important that this measure is applied fairly as intended and I welcome the work that is ongoing to ensure this is so. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions. This consultation is part of the Department and HSE&rsquo;s objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly. Upon conclusion of consultations with the trade unions, full details of the application process, FAQs and other particulars shall be published by the HSE. </p></reply>

In particular, I fully acknowledge that community optometrists have played a key role in responding to the health needs of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  During COVID-19 optometrists have been responsive to the challenges presented and have developed guidelines and procedures to safely deliver patient care. I also recognise that optometrists have also played an important role in the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. </p>  <p>  At present optometry operates largely in the private sector in practices throughout Ireland. However, the Community Ophthalmic Services Scheme (COSS) is an agreement entered into between the HSE and Ophthalmologists, Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians. It provides Community Eye Care Services to eligible patients.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the development of community services which can facilitate expanded and more integrated provision of eye care in local communities. In 2022, the HSE will advance the transfer of care for children aged 8+ years to local optometrists, thereby reducing waiting lists and enhancing access to primary eye care services. It is anticipated that it will be possible to bring the project to conclusion over a 6-to-9-month time frame in 2022.</p>  <p>  Ensuring an appropriate pipeline of suitably qualified healthcare professionals is a key priority. It is critical that we continue to attract, train, and retain sufficient appropriately qualified healthcare workers to ensure the health service can meet the projected future demand for healthcare.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department engage on an ongoing basis with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science on determining the longer-term skills needs of the healthcare sector, and the role which the Further and Higher Education sector can play in meeting those skills needs. </p>  <p>  It is recognised by both Departments that there is a need to ensure the availability of graduates with the skills necessary to support the healthcare system and to support a strategic approach to workforce planning for the health sector. </p></reply>

Finally, Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine has led to further significant hikes in energy prices and significant concerns around supply chain disruption. </p><p>I outlined my concerns in relation to the impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on agri-food supply chains, and especially on inputs such as fertiliser and feed at the extraordinary informal meeting of European Union Agriculture Ministers held on 2<sup>nd</sup>March.  I also called for ongoing close monitoring of the situation and underlined the need for supports.  Commissioner Wojciechowski is aware of concerns and is considering the issue of necessary supports under the CMO Regulation. </p><p>I launched the 2022 Soils, Nutrients and Fertiliser Campaign at Teagasc&rsquo;s Ballyhaise College on the 26th January in response to the unprecedented fertiliser price levels.  This is a credible roadmap that will help alleviate the short term price pressure while helping farmers reduce their dependency on chemical fertiliser in the longer-term. </p><p>My Department will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation. </p></reply>

Introducing an exemption for the afforestation in certain circumstances facilitates the exclusion of clearly defined activities from requiring an afforestation licence. </p>  <p>  This exemption is an enabling proposal that allows forests to be created through initiatives, other than the afforestation scheme, thereby contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s targets in relation to a wide range of environmental priorities particularly climate change, biodiversity and water quality.</p>  <p>  These proposed changes are being introduced as part of the Animal Health and Welfare and Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, which will allow the Minister to make Regulations to facilitate small scale planting of native tree areas without the need to first obtain an afforestation licence. This Bill has progressed through all stages in the legislative process in the D&aacute;il and is currently before the Seanad, third stage. </p>  <p>  Once the legislation is in place, a scheme will be developed to facilitate such planting in a legally compliant and sustainable manner. The development of  the scheme will be undertaken following the completion of the Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment, subject to the findings of both assessments. </p>  <p>  As always, staff resources are kept under constant  review to ensure that the system is in a position to meet the needs of those applying to plant trees.</p></reply>

The effectiveness of these new compliant films has not yet been independently verified and my Department has impressed upon the producers of maize plastic the need for independent research to show their effectiveness.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has had several engagements with officials in the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Communications regarding the regulation and implementation of same.</p>  <p>  In parallel, in terms of support for the sector, my Department continued Value for Cultivation &amp;amp; Use (VCU) trials for covered maize in 2021 and produced the 2022 (plastic) Covered Recommended List detailing varieties suitable for maize producers using up existing stocks of the older plastic. In addition, DAFM re-commenced VCU trials for uncovered maize in 2020 to identify varieties better suited to Irish growing conditions and which do not require plastic covering. Following the minimum 3 years of trialing from 2020 until 2022 inclusive, my Department plans to produce a 2023 Uncovered Recommended List.</p></reply>

As of 1<sup>st</sup>January this year we had 27 full-time equivalent ecologists where in September 2019 we had just one.  This is made of part time and full time ecologists, some permanent and mostly contract. Over half of this 27 had been taken on by September 2020. </p><p>The results of this investment in resources are clear as my Department issued 4,050 forestry licences in 2021 a 56% increase on 2020 figures.  For 2022 our aim is to increase this again to 5,250 licences.  </p><p>Recently the Department put out another Request for Tender for Ecological services.  This has just concluded and will give the Department more flexibility in hiring additional ecologists to achieve our 2022 targets.</p></reply>

Carbon sequestration by forests is influenced by a range of factors including species, soil type, site conditions and management practices. The rate of sequestration changes over time as a forest develops and matures. </p>  <p>  When forests are young the sequestration rate is low but as the trees mature their ability to sequester carbon dioxide as increases. The national forest estate is an important store for carbon, estimated at over 312 million tonnes.  </p>  <p>  Projections of the greenhouse gas balance show that Ireland&rsquo;s forests will transition from a sink to a source by 2024. This trend is primarily related to the increasing rate of felling in private forests and the extent of historical afforestation on peats. </p>  <p>  However, as these forests are replanted they will again sequester carbon and the strength of the forest sink will increase as these forests mature.</p>  <p>  The forest sector, including afforestation, has an important part to play in meeting the ambitious roadmap towards climate neutrality and as outlined in the Climate Action Plan 2021 which aims to afforest 8,000ha annually to 2030. </p>  <p>  This target is ambitious when compared to recent afforestation rates and will be challenging to meet in the next decade. Clearly more needs to be done to substantially increase our afforestation rates over the next decade.</p>  <p>  There are many land-use options available to landowners and forestry is a strong contender, especially in view of the generous incentives currently available under the afforestation scheme. Finally, the Department and stakeholders are working together to deliver Project Woodland with a view to resolve the current difficulties in the forestry sector and revitalise the creation of forests in Ireland.</p></reply>

The consultation is now closed, and the DECC is currently considering the responses received.</p><p>While the AD industry in Ireland is at a nascent stage of development when compared to many other European countries there are potential opportunities for farmers to make a contribution not only as owner/operators of AD plants but also through the provision of bioenergy feedstocks to the industry such as and grass/grass silage and organic manures. </p><p>These activities represent both income and land use diversification options for farmers while also providing farmers with a pathway to reduce fertilizer usage through the increased availability of digestate with resulting positive climate change implications.</p><p>My Department is also supporting research, development and demonstration in this particular area. There are currently two projects funded from the European Innovation Partnerships Initiative (EIP) under the Rural Development Programme 2014 - 2020.  The Biorefinery Glas (small scale farmer-led green biorefineries) and Irish Bioenergy Association (IrBEA) small biogas demonstration programme have been awarded funding of over &euro;900,000 each.  In addition my Department has a key regulatory role to play when using animal-by-products as feedstock for Anaerobic Digestion.  </p><p>My Department continues to proactively engage with DECC on AD and other energy related matters to ensure that the agricultural contribution to the decarbonisation of the energy system is maximised.</p></reply>

Improving this conversion rate should be a priority both for the sector and the Department.</p>  <p>  We very much hope that these landowners will consider using their licences to plant and we will be appreciative if those who make a different decision could advise us of the reasons why; such responses are of course entirely voluntary.

Nitrous oxide makes up the next biggest share at approximately 30% of the total, with the remainder being carbon dioxide. </p><p>Approximately 40% of the nitrous oxide produced from the sector relates to the use on Irish farms of chemical nitrogen fertilisers. Within the agricultural chapter of the 2021 Climate Action Plan a key metric in terms of reducing nitrous oxide emissions is underpinned by changing farm management practices in relation to nutrient use. </p><p>A key performance indicator in the achievement of this reduction is a reduction in the use of chemical nitrogen on Irish farms to below 350,000 tonnes by 2025 and to below 325,000 tonnes by 2030.  By reducing chemical Nitrogen fertiliser use to 350,000 tons, it will deliver an abatement in GHG emissions of 0.4 MtCO2 eq. in that year. An additional 0.2 MtCO2 eq. will be realised when chemical Nitrogen is reduced to 325,000. The total abatement associated with this level of reduction in Nitrogen is 0.6 MtCO2eq in emissions. </p><p>While achieving these reductions while maintaining productivity on Irish farms will be challenging, they can be met through nutrient management planning, a focus on soil health, optimising soil pH, better use of organic manures, the use of clover and multi species swards and the adoption of new technologies such as Low Emission Slurry Spreading (LESS). </p></reply>

I expect to bring a Memo to Government with the General Scheme of the Bill shortly. </p><p>In April 2021, I signed Statutory Instrument No. 198 of 2021 transposing the UTP Directive directly into Irish law before the 1st May 2021 deadline for transposition. At that time, I also established the UTP Enforcement Authority in my Department on an interim basis pending the finalisation of the primary legislation for the new Office. </p><p>The Enforcement Authority has been assigned all the necessary legal powers to investigate complaints from suppliers of agricultural and food products, to carry out investigations on its own initiative, and to initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the unfair trading practices defined in the Directive. It is open to those suppliers, including primary producers, to engage with the Enforcement Authority on any concerns they may have in relation to unfair trading practices.</p><p>When the new Office of National Food Ombudsman, or equivalent, is established, it shall not only take over the enforcement functions of the interim authority, but also carry out a price reporting and market analysis function for the agri-food supply chain in Ireland, a function I believe will bring greater transparency to the sector. Increased availability of market information will strengthen the position of primary producers and other smaller suppliers in the agricultural and food supply chain.  </p><p>In September 2021, I signed into law another Statutory Instrument which will give effect in Irish law to additional price reporting obligations for the meat and dairy sectors. This is an initiative which aims to improve food market price transparency in the EU. </p><p>With regard to the funding allocation for the new Office, which will be a new State body, a figure of &euro;1 million was set aside in Budget 2021 for the establishment of the Office. However, given the complexity of the legislation and the requirement to transpose the Directive by 1 May 2021, it was not possible to establish the new Office in 2021. As the interim UTP Enforcement Authority was staffed by officers of my Department, financing required for staffing, premises and ancillary services such as IT was met by my Department&rsquo;s administrative budget. </p><p>Budget 2022 provides an allocation of &euro;4 million in the Vote of my Department for the establishment of the new Office. This will provide for the initial staffing of the Office, set up costs and premises. Budgetary requirements for the Office will be monitored on an on-going basis in consultation with the Department of Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>I believe increased price and market reporting and analysis will be an important tool, along with other initiatives including the establishment of the Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) Enforcement Authority and support for Producer Organisations, in strengthening the position of primary producers. </p><p>Ensuring there is a long-term, sustainable and viable future for our farmers is a key priority of mine as Minister.</p></reply>
