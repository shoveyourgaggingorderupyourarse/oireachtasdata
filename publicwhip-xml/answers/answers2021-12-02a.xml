    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-02a.6.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120200083#WRA00500"><p>Business innovation districts are a novel initiative supported by my Department through our agency Enterprise Ireland (EI).  Details of some projects which are currently underway and are at varying stages of development include, for example, Ghala Project, sponsored by Trinity College Dublin and also funded by Government under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF).   This was to be the initial project in the development of an Innovation district in the Grand Canal Quay and Pearse Street area of Dublin. Following refurbishment difficulties with the listed Tower Building, Ghala has now acquired two adjacent buildings in the past few months. It has obtained planning permission and has gone to tender for the development of these buildings. This will be the first steps in the delivery of this  Innovation District.  Ghala has also had initial pre-planning discussions on the delivery of another phase of this initiative which will commence in the next few years.</p>  <p>  In Galway, the Chamber of Commerce has developed a subsidiary company called the Galway City Innovation District (GCID) which operates the PorterShed facility since 2016. There are early stage plans to align and collaborate with other incubation, scaling and research facilities in the city and to be the driver/innovation district for enterprise in the West. These include Galway Technology Centre; GMIT and NUIG. My Department, through Enterprise Ireland, approved grant aid to develop a scaling space for projects which are progressing out of PorterShed and other incubation facilities in Galway and the West. </p>  <p>  Regional Enterprise Development funding was also approved to relocate the PorterShed itself to the new Bowling Green facility. The contractors are currently on-site in this building with an expected completion timeframe of July/August 2022. </p>  <p>  At present the Midlands Innovation District in Athlone is progressing by way of a feasibility study from the National Just Transition Fund. It is envisaged that this study will be completed by year end 2021.</p>  <p>  The Boyne Valley Innovation District was also approved funding under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund and thus far has progressed to the design stage.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-02a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120200083#WRA00800"><p>Where an employee is laid off for periods during their last three years of employment, those periods do not constitute reckonable service for the purposes of redundancy calculations. In light of the extensive periods of lay-off some people will have experienced during the pandemic emergency period, this may have a significant impact on their redundancy entitlement if they are made redundant within the next three years. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, on 27th October, Government approved the drafting of a Bill to enable an exceptional additional payment to be made from the Social Insurance Fund to employees who were laid off as a result of pandemic-related restrictions and are subsequently made redundant. The General Scheme of the Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny on the first of December, and the Bill will be advanced as soon as possible thereafter. </p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection is working on the necessary administrative systems to provide for the application and payment processes, and is liaising closely with my officials.</p></reply>

For cross border consumer protection issues, the CCPC is part of the European Consumer Protection Co-operation (CPC) Network, which is comprised of national authorities responsible for enforcing EU consumer protection laws. This network protects consumers when conducting transactions across national borders and allows consumer protection agencies to co-operate to resolve particular consumer issues. I am advised by the CCPC that the CPC Network is central to addressing this matter, which involved the purchase of properties in France. These properties were developed, marketed, sold and managed by French traders under a French &lsquo;Residence de Tourisme&rsquo; scheme devised by the French Government to provide tourist accommodation in France. Under the European CPC network, the appropriate authorities to conduct an investigation in relation to this matter are the French consumer protection authorities &ndash; Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R&eacute;pression des Fraudes (&lsquo;DGCCRF&rsquo;). </p>  <p>  The CCPC assures me that it has engaged with the DGCCRF with respect to the issues highlighted by Irish property purchasers of these French properties. The CCPC received complaints from Irish property purchasers and provided an initial preliminary assessment to the DGCCRF for over 150 complainants. Following consultation with the DGCCRF, the CCPC collated and transferred to the DGCCRF the transactional documentation of over 150 Irish complainants. The CCPC has and continues to provide significant time and resources to this matter and to supporting the DGCCRF investigation. In addition, throughout the period of engagement with the DGCCRF, whenever issues have been raised by complainants or where they have requested the CCPC to forward additional documentation to DGCCRF in relation to any matters, the CCPC has done so and acted in accordance with DGCCRF instructions to ensure compliance with French legal requirements regarding criminal investigations. </p>  <p>  The DGCCRF are investigating the issues that were referred to the CCPC by the complainants involved. The primary focus of the CCPC is to continue to support the DGCCRF investigation through providing any assistance or information requested by the DGCCRF. The CCPC has not yet received the final report of the DGCCRF investigation. The CCPC has kept lines of communication open with the complainants and has updated complainants when such updates have been provided by the DGCCRF. That will continue to be the case.  The DGCCRF have advised that they will inform the CCPC when reports are handed over to the Public Prosecutor in France and they will draw the Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s attention to the importance of keeping Irish complainants informed about the state of play of proceedings.  </p>  <p>  The CCPC considers this matter as a high priority issue and one which they have dedicated considerable resources.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Ireland does not ratify international conventions until it has been determined that national law is in line with the provisions of the international instrument.</p><p>Convention 190 is the first ever international instrument on the very important issues of eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work. Ireland already has very strong protections in law to combat violence and harassment in the world of work and has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention).  </p><p>My officials have been engaging with relevant Departments and offices to establish the extent to which domestic legislative provisions already provide for the rights and entitlements enunciated in the Convention, as well as legislative amendments, if any, that may be required to enable ratification. The Department is now conducting an analysis of the outcomes of that engagement.</p><p>Following  this consideration, as part of the ratification process, my officials will undertake a stakeholder consultation with the social partners and other interested parties.  It is anticipated that this will take place in the coming months once the analysis, mentioned above, is completed.</p><p>I can assure you of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to work towards being amongst the first ILO member States to ratify Convention 190.</p></reply>

Typically, the Department and its Offices are in shared accommodation, either with other Government Departments, public bodies and/or the private sector. </p>  <p>  The Department and its Offices are located in 11 locations across the country.As tenants the Department works closely with OPW colleagues, and where relevant, engages with the local landlords and with other tenants, to ensure the provision of appropriate, fit-for-purpose accommodation for our staff and any visitors to the buildings. </p>  <p>  As part of our internal response to the COVID-19 pandemic my Department has implemented a suite of infection prevention control measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission and to assist in making the work environment as safe as possible. </p>  <p>  As alluded to in the national Work Safely Protocol, ventilation is not a standalone measure in itself and it is key that staff, and visitors alike, continue to adhere to all aspects of the prevailing public health guidance such as social distancing, ensuring good hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette such as facemask wearing in communal areas, proper cough etiquette and availing of vaccinations when offered same. </p>  <p>  Given the nature of the buildings occupied by my Department and its Offices, the technical advice provided by the OPW to date is that there is no need for additional mechanical interventions to be made to our buildings to enhance ventilation at this time. This OPW advice comes with the caveat that the Department should, and is ensuring, that all reasonable arrangements are in place to maximise ventilation through a combination of actions tailored to their locations. This includes opening more windows and carefully managing the overall numbers daily in each location so as to ensure rooms do not become overcrowded.Such arrangements are overseen by a dedicated Health and Safety Unit working in conjunction with colleagues across the Department and its Offices. </p>  <p>  To provide added assurance to staff and in supplementing our range of COVID-19 specific control measures, my Department has also installed approximately 20 air quality monitors in various locations across our buildings where these were deemed to be warranted. These are small mobile monitors which provide real-time information such as CO2 levels in rooms and will inform us if there are negative issues with ventilation.  To date, the information gleaned from the monitors backs up the OPW technical advice in relation to ventilation in our occupied buildings. </p>  <p>  As has been the case throughout the pandemic, my Department will of course keep all health and safety related issues under review and will liaise closely with the OPW and with other external expertise as required.  </p></reply>

The Programme supports the low carbon energy transition by developing skills and capacity, at a community level, in determing how to use less energy, adopting lower carbon options for transport and heating, shifting energy use to off-peak times or investing in smart technologies.    The SEC process of learning consists of 3 core steps of Learn (the SEC Network), Plan (the Energy Master Plan partnership) and the Do stage. Under this latter stage, the SECs access the various SEAI energy efficiency grants, notably the Community Energy Grant Scheme, to help them progress their identified projects. </p>  <p>  The Community Energy Grant Scheme supports support cross-sectoral, partnership approaches that deliver energy savings to a range of building types including public, commercial and community buildings with a particular focus on using the projects to deliver home retrofits. Furthermore, the Scheme is designed to engage all members of the SEC network who wish to participate in delivery of energy efficiency works. The 2021 budget for the Community Energy Grant Scheme is &euro;30 million, a &euro;10 million increase on the allocation in 2020.  </p>  <p>  There are currently 600 SEC members in the network, of which 110 joined in 2021. Under the Programme, a total of 176 Energy Master Plans have been submitted to the SEAI, of which 50 were submitted in 2021. There are a total of 62 SECs at the Do stage.</p>  <p>  The National Retrofit Plan which was launched recently as part of the Climate Action Plan 2021, sets a target of 1,500 member communities in the SEC Network by 2030.  Under the Plan, SECs will be supported by Government to continue and expand their roles as &lsquo;activators&rsquo; in their community. </p>  <p>  Details of the organisations and communities involved in the SEC Programme can be found on SEAI&rsquo;s website www.seai.ie/sustainable-solutions/community-projects/sustainable-energy-communities/.</p></reply>

The Scheme has resulted in Bord na M&oacute;na reassigning employees from peat harvesting activities into rehabilitation operations, while supporting the natural environment and biodiversity of the peatlands. It is estimated that over the period to 2050, 3.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions will be avoided (including an amount of future carbon sequestration), in comparison to a standard rehabilitation scenario.   Rehabilitation, which includes water management operations under the EDRRS, has commenced on 18 bogs. In addition, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is currently undertaking a programme to restore Ireland&rsquo;s raised bog Special Areas of Conservation and Natural Heritage Areas, a key action of the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022.

The only airports that are eligible for supports are airports that deliver international connectivity.  The criteria applied are as set out in the EU Commission Decision SA59709 as follows:</p><p>ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/cases1/202118/290271_2270935_109_2.pdf. </p><p>As outlined in the Decision the objective of Measure 1 is to compensate the damage suffered by the Irish airport operators due to the imposition of the general advisory and other containment measures linked to the COVID-19 outbreak in Ireland and other countries under Article 107(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, during the period from 1 April to 30 June 2020. </p><p>The objective of Measure 2 and Measure 3 is to ensure air connectivity and broadly support the general economy and development in Ireland by providing support to airport operators. </p><p>My Department is currently engaging with the Commission to amend this scheme to reflect the increase in budget of an additional &euro;90m.</p><p>In relation to funding of &euro;36m in 2022 under the Regional Airports Programme 2021-2025, this funding remains targeted at airports that operate scheduled services and have annual passenger numbers of fewer than 1 million (during the two financial years preceding the year in which aid is granted).  Scheduled services must facilitate international connectivity, either directly or via another national hub airport such as Dublin.  </p><p>Waterford Airport had been eligible for funding under the last Regional Airports Programme (2015 to 2019).  However, following a continued decline in demand for services over successive years from 2008, Waterford Airport became ineligible for funding when all remaining scheduled flights ceased at the airport in June 2016.</p><p>Given the above, without passenger flights or plans to develop passenger flights, Waterford Airport&rsquo;s operations failed to meet the connectivity objective associated with Government policy on regional airports. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Waterford Airport has faced serious financial challenges since scheduled flights ceased at the airport.  In order to avoid liquidation, the airport sought subvention from the Department of Transport in December 2017.</p><p>The Government at that time committed to providing support to Waterford Airport, on an exceptional basis, in order to allow time for the consideration of future options at the airport, including a proposal to expand its runway. </p><p>While some operational payments to Waterford airport were made on an exceptional basis between 2018 and 2020 in anticipation of the return of scheduled services, the radically changed outlook for the return of such services means that such payments cannot be continued.  </p><p>Waterford Airport have been advised that there is no policy basis on which the State can fund general aviation. (Other airports in a similar position are not eligible for funding under the Regional Airports Programme.) </p></reply>

The Interchange has been operating beyond capacity at peak times and this results in significant traffic queues/delays on all of the approach roads, including the Jack Lynch tunnel, which also presents a safety risk. </p><p>The upgrade to the Interchange will improve safety by providing clearly designated lanes for traffic with minimal weaving or crossovers of traffic flow, thereby avoiding complex manoeuvres which could lead to accidents. It is also expected that this upgrade will deliver a reduction in traffic flows in the Cork urban network. The Net Present Value across all traffic growth scenarios indicate the scheme will generate substantial reductions in journey times and safety benefits for those using the Interchange, which more than justify the cost of construction. All examined traffic scenarios returned strongly positive Benefit to Cost ratios (BCRs).</p><p>Noting the above position, I have referred your question to TII for a direct and more detailed reply.

Since May 2021, the RSA has been returning to delivering tests for all customers, while continuing to prioritise critical frontline workers. This means, in the interest of fairness, the RSA targeted test appointments to those waiting longest who are ready and eligible to take the test.</p>  <p>  When the service resumed in June 2020, testers were conducting five tests each per day, as against eight before the pandemic. This subsequently increased to six tests and since 27 September 2021, has further increased to seven tests per tester per day.</p>  <p>  In order to deal with the backlog created by Covid, the RSA received approval to rehire 36 temporary testers in 2020. In addition, the RSA received sanction to hire 40 additional testers on a temporary basis to assist with the backlogs. These new testers completed their training and have been conducting tests since July 2021. Sanction has also been granted to recruit a further 40 testers. </p>  <p>  The 36 temporary testers rehired in 2020 are on contracts which are due to expire in December, March, and May. My Department has approved a further extension of contracts for those due to expire in December and March. The RSA will conduct a review in Quarter 1 next year to see how the service is performing and to reassess its needs in light of evolving demand. </p></reply>

Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the following medical criteria, in order to obtain a Primary Medical Certificate:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The current medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer. Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.</p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken.</p>  <p>  In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.

Its work was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Minister O&rsquo;Gorman has confirmed that he has asked his officials to reconvene the working group established to carry out that review at the earliest opportunity and we are both agreed that this is the most appropriate forum for the review.

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis.</p><p>In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (25<sup>th</sup>November) by EWSS is almost &euro;6.5 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of &euro;5.58 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;877 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 690,300 employees. </p><p>Government policy has been that there will be no cliff edge to the support, at the same time it is necessary to gradually unwind and phase out this temporary emergency support measure. That is why, on Budget Day, I announced the extension of EWSS in a graduated form until 30 April 2022. This ensures there will be no sudden end to the EWSS and also provides clarity and certainty to business.</p><p>Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government has adopted a proactive and dynamic approach to supporting businesses and individuals insofar as possible during this challenging time.</p><p>As regards the EWSS and the current circumstances, the Government continues to monitor developments closely and will consider if any response is required at an appropriate time. </p><p>Finally, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available over the course of the last 18 months or so &ndash; including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.

The VAT Directive obliges each Member State to have a standard rate of VAT and also allows that a Member State may choose to have no more than two reduced rates of VAT, which may be no less than 5%, and which may be applied to certain goods and services:  any of those listed in Annex III of the Directive. Within this framework, Ireland currently applies a standard rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%. </p>  <p>  The EU Directive permits derogations from the general rules to allow an individual Member State to continue certain historic tax treatments, such as the application of one of their reduced rates to particular goods and services which are not included in Annex III.  Ireland, in line with the VAT Directive and by way of special derogation from the general rule, maintains several &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; provisions and derogations that allow us to maintain reduced rates to certain supplies for historical reasons. It is on this basis that Ireland applies its 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to the supply of fuel, gas, oil, and electricity services for both domestic and commercial use. The current 13.5% VAT rate applied to energy products is a &lsquo;parked rate&rsquo;, governed by Article 118 of the VAT Directive and standstill provisions from 1991 and cannot be reduced below 12%.</p>  <p>  Article 102 of the VAT Directive provides that, after consultation with the EU VAT Committee, a Member State may choose to apply a reduced rate (no less than 5%) to the supply of natural gas, electricity, or district heating on a temporary basis.  The EU Commission recently indicated that this provision could now be used by Member States without the requirement to consult the VAT Committee in advance.</p>  <p>  Under its existing provisions, Ireland already applies a reduced VAT rate to a broader range of energy products (including the supply of fuel, gas, oil and electricity services) than would be allowed under Article 102, which is restricted only to supplies of natural gas, electricity, district heating.</p>  <p>  Because a Member State may only have a maximum of two reduced rates, if Ireland were to consider introducing a new reduced rate, even on a temporary basis, for the supply of natural gas, electricity and district heating as allowed under Article 102 of the Directive, then it would not be permissible to also continue both of our existing reduced rates of 9% and 13.5%.  This would mean that one of those existing rates would have to be removed and the goods and services covered by those rates would have to move either to one of the other reduced rates or to the standard rate.  However, there is a significant restriction on this, as the services to which the 13.5% reduced rate applies on a historic basis (i.e. the &ldquo;parked&rdquo; services) cannot be moved to a rate below 12%.  Therefore, depending on the reduced rates chosen, this restriction could mean that the services that are currently at the &lsquo;parked  rate&rsquo;, would have to move to the standard rate of 23%.</p></reply>

It is a nationwide tax paid upon registration of a vehicle in the State, based on its emissions profile. A VRT surcharge based on nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions levels was introduced in Budget 2020 in recognition of the negative externalities these emissions have on public health and the environment. The NOx pollutant is generally emitted in greater quantities by older diesel cars. Budget 2021 saw an adjustment to the VRT rates structure to underpin the environmental rationale of the tax and incentivise the uptake of cleaner cars. </p>  <p>  Customs Duty need not be paid on a vehicle first registered in Northern Ireland (NI) after 1 January 2021 where it meets the following conditions:</p>  <p>  - the registration in NI was the first registration of the vehicle in the United Kingdom (UK)</p>  <p>  - the vehicle has never been exported and, or re-registered in, Great Britain (GB) or any other country outside the European Union.</p>  <p>  A vehicle brought into Northern Ireland before 1 January 2021, and which has remained there since, can be registered in the State with no customs obligations. However, proof of the vehicle&rsquo;s status in Northern Ireland prior to 1 January 2021 will be required. </p>  <p>  Vehicles first registered in GB, and subsequently registered in NI after 31 December 2020, will be subject to additional requirements if imported into the State. The same additional requirements will also apply to vehicles imported from GB to Ireland via NI. These additional requirements must be completed prior to presenting the vehicle for registration at an NCTS centre.</p>  <p>  Where a vehicle has been declared to NI customs on import into NI, including payment of any customs duties, there will remain a liability to Irish VAT on import into the State. VAT will apply at the standard rate (currently 23%) and must be discharged before the vehicle can be registered.</p>  <p>  In such cases, a Supplementary Import Declaration Form &ndash; VAT on Import on Used Vehicles, must be filed and the associated VAT on Import liability must be paid.</p>  <p>  To avail of this procedure, the declarant must be able to provide proof of the NI customs declaration on import into NI.  Such proof must clearly identify the vehicle and the date of import.</p>  <p>  If the importer does not have proof of declaration to Customs in NI then an Irish customs declaration is required. Customs duty (if applicable), and VAT on the import value of the vehicle are payable. This must be done before presenting the vehicle for registration.</p></reply>

The monument is protected under the National Monuments Acts as a Recorded Monument but it is not a national monument in State care. The bid was based on a valuation by OPW and on an archaeological and operational assessment that the monument would be an excellent addition to the portfolio of monuments in state care in Sligo, adding to the ensemble of Neolithic passage tombs, many of which are already in State care, and which characterise the Sligo landscape. Unfortunately, the vendor chose to not accept the bid put forward at the time. The monument is on private land and there is no public right of way to it.</p>  <p>  Sligo's numerous passage tombs are a remarkable asset, with a deep interconnection with the surrounding landscape. I recently endorsed the recommendations from an Expert Advisory Group (EAG) appointed by me last June to review applications to become part of a new Tentative List of potential World Heritage Properties for Ireland. The EAG has recommended that the 'Passage Tombs of Sligo' be placed on this new Tentative List. The list is an inventory of properties which have potential to demonstrate Outstanding Universal Value and therefore considered suitable for nomination to the World Heritage List in due course. My Department will be working closely with the local authority over the coming months to progress this application further. Additional information on the EAG's recommendations can be found here:  www.gov.ie/en/press-release/71039-minister-endorses-recommendations-for-new-world-heritage-tentative-list/. </p></reply>

One such programme that AHBs progress construction projects through is the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF). </p><p>CALF funding is capital support provided to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.  This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department.  </p><p>With regard to the specific project mentioned by the Deputy, I can confirm that the project did receive conditional CALF funding approval in 2018.  The most recent update from both the AHB and Local Authority is that they are currently working collaboratively to progress the project to Tender stage, which is anticipated in early 2022, with expected final delivery in 2023.</p><p>My Department publishes a quarterly Social Housing Construction Projects Status Report, which sets out the continuing progress being made in advancing the national local authority and AHB new-build pipeline.  The latest report, setting out the position at end Q2 2021, can be accessed at the following weblink:  </p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/d7709-social-housing-construction-projects-status-report-q2-2021/.</i></p></reply>

Homelessness is complex and causal factors and family circumstances vary considerably as do the responses needed. Homelessness is also inter-related with the other areas of the housing system and with broader social and healthcare policy and service delivery. Therefore, a whole of Government approach is required in dealing with this challenge.</p>  <p>  An important aspect of this plan is supporting families and children experiencing homelessness. Family homelessness, including lone-parent homelessness, has seen an appreciable reduction since 2019, but still remains a key challenge. The overriding objective is to provide homes to those households at risk of or experiencing homelessness through the various social housing supports available. </p>  <p>  Many families have found themselves trapped in long term homelessness. Housing for All commits my Department to working with Local Authorities and NGOs to identify families experiencing long-term homelessness that have complex support needs. Those that do will be provided with enhanced tenancy sustainment supports to help them exit homelessness and maintain their homes.  Additional supports are to be provided to families by Tusla the Child and Family Agency.</p>  <p>  My Department is also funding Threshold&rsquo;s Tenancy Protection Service.  This service provides advice and support to individuals, couples and families living in private rented accommodation experiencing tenancy problems. This service has been instrumental in preventing homelessness in the first instance and supporting people to remain in their homes. A number of ongoing public awareness campaigns, including those led by the Residential Tenancies Board, the Department of Social Protection and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, are all playing an important role in making households aware of the supports that are available. </p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing, particularly new build social and affordable homes, is a key priority of this Government.  Under Housing for All there are specific and costed plans to increase supply across all tenure types, including very significant commitments to social and affordable housing, with over 90,000 social homes and 36,000 affordable and 18,000 cost rental homes to be delivered by 2030. &euro;4 billion in capital is being invested annually on social and affordable housing.  This is the biggest such programme in the history of the State.</p>  <p>  Housing for All specifically provides for the establishment of a National Homeless Action Committee.  The primary objective of the Committee will be to bring together key Government Departments, agencies and stakeholders, to oversee implementation of the homeless inter-agency measures committed to under Housing for All and to ensure coherence and co-ordination of homeless related services in delivering policy measures and actions.  Arrangements for the appointment of members of the Committee are currently in train, and it is to commence operation in December 2021.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to prioritise responses for families experiencing homelessness and this is being reflected in both strategic policy and in specific actions. </p></reply>

The most recent statement by the UN Security Council on Ethiopia, led by Ireland together with African members of the Council, was issued on 5 November.  It echoed the calls of the United Nations Secretary General for full humanitarian access, a ceasefire, and political dialogue between parties. </p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the role of the African Union in seeking a peaceful solution to the conflict, including through the work of its Special Envoy, former Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo. We are committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ethiopia.</p>  <p>  Ireland's engagement internationally on Ethiopia, including at the Security Council, has been consistent with the positions and statements made by the European Union, including by the EU High Representative/Vice President Josep Borrell.</p>  <p>  Ireland has maintained a close partnership with Ethiopia since establishing our diplomatic presence there in 1994. Over &euro;160 million in Irish Aid development and humanitarian support has been provided to Ethiopia in the past 5 years, with the Embassy team playing an important role in designing and overseeing critical programmes.</p>  <p>  Ireland was the first country to commit funds to mitigate the humanitarian consequences of the current crisis in Tigray, with to date over &euro;4.4 million in humanitarian aid disbursed to mitigate the circumstances which Ethiopians in Ethiopia and who have taken refuge in Sudan find themselves due to conflict.   My Department will disburse a further &euro;16 million in Irish Aid funding over the coming weeks to humanitarian partners operating in Ethiopia including UN OCHA, UNICEF, UNFPA and the International Rescue Committee. We will continue to prioritise humanitarian need while this crisis persists.</p>  <p>  I hope the decision of the government of Ethiopia to restrict the size of the Embassy will be temporary, so that our staff can return to carrying out their important duties in the country as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship.</p><p>In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of all guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Verification of consent of all guardians is vital to protecting the integrity of the passport itself and the rights of the child and its guardians. </p><p>Passport applications are valid for six months for a number of reasons including International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) regulations on the requirement for a recent photograph. The ICAO is a UN specialised agency which defines in detail the required format for a passport. This timeframe also ensures that a refund of the fees can be processed electronically where required. If the refund is not made electronically within six months then it can take up to 12 months to process a refund by bank transfer.</p><p>With regard the specific application about which the Deputy is enquiring, the online application was received by the Passport Service on 6 June 2021. The supporting documents required to complete the application were received by the Passport Service more than three months later on 13 September 2021. This meant that the completed passport application was not submitted until 13 September 2021. As a result the passport processing could not commence until the fully completed application was received. The completed passport application was reviewed on 12 November 2021, 42 working days after the supporting documents were received. </p><p>As part of this process a member of Passport Service staff called both witnesses to the parents' signatures on the Child Identity and Consent Form on 12 November 2021. Unfortunately, neither witness was available when called and the passport application had come to the point where it was close to expiration. At that stage, as there was insufficient time available within the 6 month validity period to request, receive and process a new Child Identity and Consent form, the application was cancelled. </p><p>The Passport Service is currently reviewing the cancellation process with a view to improving customer experience.</p><p>The passport fee has been refunded in this case and I encourage the applicant's parents to re-apply for their child's passport again, ensuring all documentation is submitted immediately and that that witnesses to the parents' consent are fully contactable.</p></reply>

Both the current and former Ambassadors to the United Nations in Geneva have personally met with the individual concerned, who remains in contact with my officials.</p>  <p>  Ireland has raised the issue of the release of the names of NGO delegates to UN Member States and received assurances from the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights that, while there had been a historical practice whereby the names of participants were occasionally confirmed to States in limited circumstances, this practice had ceased since the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong advocate for the protection of civil society space and Human Rights Defenders. In 2013, Ireland led a new resolution at the Human Rights Council entitled &ldquo;Civil society space: creating and maintaining, in law and in practice a safe and enabling environment&rdquo;. This resolution addressed the issue of civil society space as a human rights concern for the first time at the Human Rights Council. Ireland continues to lead on the renewal of this resolution, most recently in July 2021, focusing attention on the essential role civil society plays in the Covid-19 response and recovery.</p>  <p>In September 2021, at the 48th   Session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland, as part of a core group, led a successful resolution condemning any acts of intimidation or reprisals against Human Rights Defenders engaging with the United Nations. </p>  <p>  In common with other European Union Member States, Ireland has raised our concerns with China regarding the situation in Xinjiang on a number of occasions, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora. Most recently, at the 48th session of the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland joined an EU Group Statement of 26 Member States, which called on China to comply with its obligations under national, and international law to respect and protect human rights, including in Xinjiang. On 21 October, Ireland joined a cross-regional statement on Human Rights in China at the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, which calls on China to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers, including the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. </p>  <p>  Bilaterally, as is standard practice, my officials have discussed the situation in Xinjiang with the Chinese Ambassador and most recently have discussed, at senior level, the application of the EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, as well as China's retaliatory actions.  I also raised our concerns regarding this situation with Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi during our meeting on 30 May. In that discussion, I outlined Ireland and the EU's position on the treatment of Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. I emphasised the importance of allowing unrestricted access to the region to independent observers in order to make an objective assessment of the situation, particularly through the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p></reply>

This Resolution reflected the position already held by Ireland, the EU and the UN for many years. </p><p>Regarding the European Citizens&rsquo; Initiative, following its registration the organisers must now gather one million signatures in support in order for it to proceed further. Ireland has previously raised at EU level the question of whether goods from occupied territories, including from settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory, should be excluded from the EU market altogether. However, it is clear that at present there is no possibility of getting substantial support, still less consensus, for such a proposal.</p><p>We have therefore instead focused our advocacy on practical measures to differentiate in EU policies between Israel itself and the illegal settlements. This has resulted in a number of EU measures already, including guidelines on the labelling of settlement goods (so that consumers can identify them and make their own choices in this matter), and exclusion of settlement institutions from EU research funding.</p><p>Settlement goods are already excluded from the normal lower tariffs applying to goods from Israel and other countries with which the EU has trade agreements, when they are imported into the EU.</p><p>I have directed my officials to continue to explore further such options, as well as the potential for them to gain support from EU partners. </p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. </p><p>A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. </p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p><p>The Department's guidance outlines CO<sub>2</sub>monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. </p><p>In excess of 35,400 monitors were delivered to schools nationwide at a cost of circa &euro;4 million which assists in guiding their ventilation strategy. </p><p>A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.  There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application for emergency works requires bespoke analysis.  </p><p>My Department's approach on good ventilation in schools, as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus, is fully consistent with Public Health advice and  the Expert Group recommendations on good practices, the use of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors and the targeted deployment of HEPA air filter devices where necessary for poorly ventilated areas. </p><p>There are a number of options for schools who wish to apply for capital funding towards ventilation works in their school buildings including the Emergency Works Scheme and on a more planned basis as part of the Summer Works scheme.

In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with school patron bodies/school authorities to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. </p><p>This engagement with Patrons/school authorities is ongoing and is focussed on ensuring that the start of the 2022/23 school year operates as smoothly as possible for all schools and their students.</p><p>Details relating to the number of secondary school places that were available for the 2021-2022 academic year in County Kildare by school is available on the website of each school. The schools website also provide details of each schools admission policy and the number of places available in the school for the 2022-23 academic year.</p><p>Department officials are currently in negotiation with a landowner in respect of the acquisition of a suitable site to facilitate the construction of a new school for the existing Curragh post primary school. The Department will continue to work closely with Officials from Kildare County Council with a view to progressing acquisition of the site.  While a site acquisition process is underway, given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally, the Department is not in a position to comment further at this time. This matter is being given priority attention and my Department is attempting to bring the matter to a close as soon as possible. </p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. </p><p>A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. </p><p>The Expert Group in its report notes &ldquo;<i>very good advice is contained in the Department of Education&rsquo;s Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools</i>&rdquo;</p><p>And that &ldquo;<i>It must be emphasized that ventilation should be delivered as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.&rdquo;</i></p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p><p>The Expert Group also note &ldquo;<i>consider</i><i>using a portable carbon dioxide (CO</i><i><sub>2</sub></i><i>) monitor to identify areas of the school with inadequate ventilation</i>. The Departments guidance outlines CO<sub>2</sub>monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. </p><p>In excess of 35,400 monitors were delivered to schools nationwide at a cost of circa &euro;4 million. </p><p>A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department.</p><p>Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.</p><p>The Expert Group also notes the potential use for air cleaners<i>&ldquo;consider using stand-alone high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter devices to further reduce airborne virus in poorly ventilated spaces&rdquo;</i></p><p>The Departments Guidance is clear that where the recommended measures in the Practical Steps and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available. This is line with Expert Group guidance which identifies that in areas with poor ventilation that structural interventions and measures to increase natural ventilation should be completed. Where such structural interventions or measures are not possible in the short term, that consideration should be given to using stand-alone HEPA filter devices in poorly ventilated spaces pending the completion of structural interventions.</p><p>There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. If, following consultation with a supplier a school feels that its individual space may require specific technical specialist advice then the assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect can be sought.</p><p>The requirement for air cleaners in schools will depend on advices provided to schools by their Architect/Engineer. As part of contingency planning, the Department has put arrangements in place (including at ETB level) for a small reserve of air cleaners to facilitate quick deployment to any primary or post-primary school which has an immediate need and has been unsuccessful in sourcing locally. </p><p>In conclusion my Departments approach on good ventilation in schools, as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus, is fully consistent with Public Health advice and  the Expert Group recommendations on good practices, the use of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors and the targeted deployment of HEPA air filter devices where necessary for poorly ventilated areas.</p></reply>

The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<b></b></p></reply>

The rules for the co-ordination of invalidity benefits in the EU are provided for in EC Regulation No 883/2004, invalidity benefits being a branch of social security co-ordinated under this regulation. As such the term &ldquo;Invalidity Pension&rdquo; is an instantly recognisable term in respect of its purpose and the risk it covers in both an EU and domestic context.  Invalidity benefits/pension are generally provided where an insured person suffers incapacity for work leading to permanent invalidity.</p>  <p>  It is also very difficult to find a term that is acceptable to everyone and that continues to be acceptable over the passage of time.  However, the terminology in this case reflects accurately the purpose of the payment and is consistent with the relevant European Directive, thereby avoiding any legal ambiguity around the status of the payment.</p>  <p>  My Department gives careful thought to the terminology used in respect of schemes and entitlements and works very closely with stakeholders to ensure that the language used is appropriate. These issues are kept under review; however, for the reasons outlined, I do not propose a change at this time.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment, a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses, as well as single exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs).</p>  <p>  The basic supplementary welfare allowance provides immediate assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. This assistance is subject to the person having the right to reside and satisfying the Habitual Residence Condition (HRC). Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. The ENP scheme is demand-led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. ENPs are not subject to the HRC.</p>  <p>  The person concerned made an application for SWA on 22/2/2021 and was paid an ENP pending a decision on this application. As stated above, in order to qualify for SWA, a person must, inter alia, satisfy the requirement to be habitually resident in the State. The person concerned failed to produce documentation requested by the Designated Officer, including any evidence of the right to reside in the State.

The actions are designed to support survivors in a number of ways and to contribute to healing and future wellbeing. </p>  <p>  While the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme will benefit an estimated 34,000 people at a total cost of &euro;800 million, it is just one element of the Government&rsquo;s response to the country&rsquo;s complex legacy of Mother and Baby Institutions and should not be viewed in isolation from the broader Action Plan. For those who spent short periods of time as children in Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions, the overwhelming priority need which has been expressed is access to birth information and records. A lack of information about their origins is deeply troubling to many survivors and the remedy to address this is making sure that they have access to this information. Therefore, I have prioritised work on legislation that is going to achieve this important aim, in the form of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill. </p>  <p>  Consultation with survivors on the design of the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme also clearly showed that they wanted a Scheme that would be non-adversarial, simple and with a low burden of proof. This is what the proposals for the Scheme seek to deliver. Further to extensive and challenging deliberations, it was concluded that providing a general payment based on time spent in an institution, with no requirement to bring forward any evidence of abuse or harm was the best way to ensure that the Scheme causes no further trauma. </p>  <p>  I have been given Government approval to bring forward legislative proposals on the basis of the Scheme as outlined and work has commenced in my Department on draft Heads of Bill. Through the legislative process, there will be further opportunities to examine any issues or concerns that have been raised in relation to the Scheme.</p></reply>

Since then my Department has taken a series of steps to implement these reforms, with a view to completing them by the end of 2024. </p><p>A staff team has been established in my Department to lead the transition to the new model. Ending Direct Provision and putting in place the new system with its focus on human rights, on not-for-profit delivery, and on integration from day one, requires a whole-of-Government approach. My Department is therefore working closely with key stakeholders across Government to plan, design, and implement the changes described in the White Paper. </p><p>I have appointed a Programme Board, including officials from relevant Government Departments and agencies, and independent members, to oversee the transition. So far, the Board has met four times since its establishment, and its next meeting is scheduled for 16 December.</p><p>I have appointed a three-person External Advisory Group whose role is that of independent observer of the implementation of the new policy. Through its work, this Group will help to build confidence in the reform programme among all stakeholders. This Group has already met twice, most recently on 19 November. </p><p>As stated in the White Paper, my intention is to have the new system of supports and accommodation for international protection applicants operational by December 2024.  We have made good progress on this objective to date.  Working with the Housing Agency, my Department has begun to acquire the accommodation needed to implement the White Paper reforms. We are currently prioritising the acquisition of accommodation for Phase Two - that is, after people have completed their initial four months in a Reception and Integration Centre and move into the community. </p><p>We anticipate that the process of moving the first applicants into this accommodation will begin in 2022 and that it will accelerate over the following years as more properties come on stream.</p><p>Working with the housing experts on the Programme Board, my Department is developing an ownership model for the accommodation, as well as a funding model to enable Approved Housing Bodies and other not-for-profit organisations to act as our delivery partners. An allocation key to determine the spread of this accommodation across all counties has been agreed by Local Authorities.</p><p>With respect to integration, the House will be aware that the White Paper commits to the principle of 'integration from day one' for all international protection applicants. My Department is currently developing the detailed policy required to meet this commitment. This integration policy will enable applicants to live independently in Ireland and will help them to feel at home in their new communities. Integration supports will be delivered during both Phase One and Phase Two of the new model. </p><p>During Phase One, applicants will live in a Reception and Integration Centre, where they will participate in an Integration Programme including language tuition and orientation to living in Ireland. In Phase Two, after four months, applicants will move to independent living in the community. </p><p>Here they will have access to integration supports delivered by service providers at a local level through Interagency Working Groups co-ordinated by the relevant Local Authority. Applicants will also be assisted by a network of Integration Support Workers, who will help to link them in with the supports they need.</p><p>When living in the community, applicants will receive an International Protection Support Payment to enable them to meet their needs. A child payment will also be provided. As applicants now have access to the labour market after six months, support to access employment will also be provided. Detailed policy on the International Protection Support Payments is being developed by my Department. </p><p>It will take time to end Direct Provision and replace it with a new and very different system of accommodation and supports - grounded in human rights and delivered on a not-for-profit basis.  However, I am fully committed to implementing the model by December 2024.</p></reply>

A new funding model will be a key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State.</p><p>An Expert Group was established in September 2019 to develop a new funding model for the sector. The Group was tasked with examining the current model of funding, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and considering how additional resourcing can best be structured in order to achieve these objectives. </p><p>The Expert Group have met 21 times since late 2019. They have presented their report to me, and it is due to be submitted to Government shortly. Since the report is under consideration, it is not possible at present to share the full details of its recommendations but, subject to Government approval, it will be published in the coming weeks. In line with the Group's Terms of Reference, the recommendations will seek to further achieve policy objectives of quality, affordability, accessibility and contributing to addressing disadvantage through increased public funding and public management.</p><p>I have met with the Chair of the Group and was briefed on its progress, which allowed for the emerging recommendations of the Expert Group to significantly inform the developments being introduced in Budget 2022. Budget 2022 introduces a ground-breaking package of measures for the early learning and childcare sector - designed to deliver quality for children, affordability for parents, stability for providers, and support employers to improve pay and conditions for staff.  An additional &euro;78m in ELC and SAC funding brings the total investment in the sector to &euro;716m next year.</p><p>The increase in funding comprises three main parts. Firstly, changes to the NCS will, inter aliam extend the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15, as recommended by the Expert Group.</p><p>Secondly, the introduction of a new Core Funding stream in September 2022 will support providers cover increased operating costs linked to quality improvement measures. This core funding stream will be worth &euro;69 million to providers in 2022 and approximately &euro;207 million in a full year from 2023 on. </p><p>Thirdly, a one-off transition fund of up to &euro;37 million will operate from May to August 2022, to support providers in the period leading up to the new core funding stream.</p><p>These new development measures announced in Budget 2022 begin the implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations. The full implementation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s recommendations is likely to be a multi-annual process, with funding becoming available on an incremental basis.</p><p>The development of the new funding model has been supported by a significant programme of research. The research partner of the Expert Group has produced a series of working papers examining Ireland&rsquo;s approach to this sector in an international context including papers on reducing costs to parents and mechanisms to control fees. The Group has also engaged in an extensive and detailed stakeholder consultation process. </p><p>Material relating to the work of the Expert Group, including reports from consultation and engagement, meeting documentation and research papers are available on a dedicated website, www.first5fundingmodel.ie.</p></reply>

In light of these recommendations, and the engagements I have had with families in Tuam, the Department is reviewing the legislation to take account of issues raised by the Committee, survivors, and family members.</p>  <p>  I am acutely conscious of the urgent need to pass legislation in order to allow exhumation at the site in Tuam. I hope to publish the Bill by the end of the current parliamentary session and bring it through the Houses of Oireachtas as quickly as possible to allow excavation of the site in 2022.</p></reply>

These standards were adopted by Government in 2019, and have been in effect since the beginning of 2021.</p><p>The National Standards meet the requirements of the relevant legislation &ndash; the EU (recast) Reception Conditions Directive which Ireland opted into in June 2018.</p><p>The first stages of the project are now underway.  My Department is currently engaging with HIQA to tie down the resources and staffing needing by HIQA to undertake its monitoring role. In parallel with this process, detailed work is being undertaken by my Department to provide the necessary legal basis for HIQA's monitoring role.  </p><p>It is important to note that there are inspections carried out under the current system.  At present, all IPAS permanent accommodation centres are subject to three unannounced inspections per year.  In 2021, two inspections are being carried out in each centre by an independent inspections company (QTS Ltd) and one by officials of the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS).</p><p>Inspections cover a wide range of issues including fire safety, appropriate signage and information for residents, the condition of communal areas and sleeping quarters, the quality of food provided and adherence to hygiene and other health and safety requirements.</p><p>IPAS has also taken steps to support adherence to the National Standards through its contract arrangements with accommodation centres.  All properties selected under IPAS&rsquo; most recent tender process are required to be able to implement the National Standards. This requirement applies to the provision of new centres and to any renewal of a contract with a current provider.</p></reply>

I am confident that the wide-ranging Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions is fully inclusive and responds to the diverse needs of all those who are affected by the complex legacy of Mother and Baby Institutions. The actions are designed to support survivors in a number of ways into the future, as well as ensuring that what happened in the institutions is never forgotten, or repeated.</p><p>The Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme is Action number 20 in the Action Plan, and sits as  one element of the entire redress package of supports and measures set out in that Plan. Consultation with survivors has clearly shown that they wanted the Scheme to be non-adversarial, simple and with a low burden of proof. Following extensive and challenging deliberations, I concluded that providing a general payment based on time spent in an institution, with no requirement to bring forward any evidence of abuse or harm, was the best way to ensure that the Scheme causes no further trauma.  This approach means that those who spent the longest time in these institutions, and therefore suffered most from the harsh institutional conditions, will receive the highest level of payment. </p><p>The proposals for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme go well beyond the recommendations of the Commission of Investigation and also beyond the proposals of the Interdepartmental Group which was established to develop proposals for the Scheme. An estimated 34,000 people will benefit from the Scheme, at an approximate cost of &euro;800m. Beyond this, the needs of all those who spent time in one of the institutions will be addressed in some way through the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan. The Scheme should not be viewed in isolation from the Action Plan.</p><p>I have been given Government approval to bring forward legislative proposals on the basis of the Scheme as outlined and work has commenced in my Department on heads of the bill for this legislation. Through the legislative process we will have the opportunity to examine any issues or concerns that have been raised in relation to the Scheme.</p></reply>

The EWSS at flat rates is just marginally below the cost of play-pods.   </p>  <p>  My Department also oversees a Case Management process through which support can be provided to ELC and SAC services experiencing difficulties. Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process with the City and County Childcare Committees (CCC) administering on-the-ground case management assistance. This includes specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances. </p>  <p>  Financial supports may also be accessed through the Case Management process for services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal.  The Covid-19 Impact Support funding strand is available to both Community and Private services.   The CCC is the first point of contact for any service in difficulty and seeking support.</p>  <p>  In addition to the significant attention that has been afforded to the development and implementation of financial and other supports in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, an ambitious programme of reform and development has also been underway in my Department.</p>  <p>  In particular in relation to funding for the ELC and SAC sector which the Deputy references, a major initiative has been undertaken by my Department to review the current funding model, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services and consider how additional resourcing can best be structured in order to achieve these objectives. </p>  <p>  An independently-chaired Expert Group has led this work.  The Group has recently finalised its report and recommendations for a new funding model for the sector.  They have presented to me and the report will shortly be considered by Government.  </p>  <p>  In advance of the 2022 Estimates process, I met with the Chair of the Group and was briefed on its progress which allowed for the emerging recommendations to significantly inform Budget 2022.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provides for an significant additional allocation for the ELC and SAC sector next year and introduces a ground-breaking package of measures designed to deliver quality for children, affordability for parents, stability for providers, and support employers to improve pay and conditions for staff.  </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;78m in ELC and SAC funding brings the total investment in the sector to &euro;716m next year.</p>  <p>  The increase in funding will allow for enhancements to the National Childcare Scheme; the introduction of a new Core Funding stream in September 2022 to support providers cover increased operating costs linked to quality improvement measures; and a Transition Fund to be made available to providers in advance of the introduction of Core Funding.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;69 million (equivalent to &euro;207 for a full year) is being made for Core Funding.  Up to &euro;37 million will be available for the Transition Funding between May to August 2022.</p>  <p>  This additional funding and new developments constitute a significant and strategic new approach to funding the sector in the longer term to support quality, affordability, inclusion and sustainability.</p></reply>

AIM is a programme of supports designed to enable children with a disability to access and meaningfully participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. The goal of AIM is to create a more inclusive environment in pre-schools, so all children, regardless of ability, can benefit from quality early learning and care. The model achieves this by providing universal supports to pre-school settings, and targeted supports, which focus on the needs of the individual child, without requiring a diagnosis of disability. Since its beginning in 2016, there has been 18,521 children in 3,871 settings who received targeted supports under AIM. This does not include the many more children and services that have benefited from the universal supports funded through the AIM scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition to the specific services my Department delivers for children with disabilities, my Department co-ordinates the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) which is whole-of-government strategy for policy and action to address the needs of persons with disabilities in Ireland and support effective progress in delivering on the obligations set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  My colleague, Minister of State Anne Rabbitte T.D., chairs the NDIS Steering Group and one of the focuses of that Strategy, alongside the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, is improving transitions across state services, including for children. My Department is also developing a UNCRPD Implementation Plan and this will be finalised in 2022.  </p>  <p>  In November of this year Ireland submitted its first State Report to the UN Committee on CRPD. As part of preparations for this and other UN processes such as the UNCRC and the Universal Periodic Review, a specific consultation was held with children with disabilities, to ensure their voice was heard.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

Tusla assesses the information received and the child and family&rsquo;s situation, and provides appropriate social work intervention and family support services. Where necessary in the best interest of the child, children are received into the care of Tusla. </p>  <p>  Tusla has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team which produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, including detailed reporting on child safety and protection services. Most recent reports indicate that Tusla received 6,405 child protection and welfare referrals in September 2021, 748 (13%) more than August 2021 (5,657) and 294 (5%) more than September 2020 (6,111). The reports are published on Tusla's website and are scrutinised by my officials. Issues of note are brought to my attention. The reports provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlight challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers. </p>  <p>  Additionally, Tusla child protection and welfare, and alternative care services are inspected against the relevant Standards and Regulations by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). These inspection reports are also published, and the findings used to inform the development and improvement of services within Tusla.  HIQA's most recent thematic report of 12 child protection services was positive, identifying improvements in governance and oversight by Tusla managers. The reports include many positive comments by parents and children of their experience with social workers and give examples of good practice and dedicated staff. However, some areas continue to identify challenges in maintaining a consistently high standard of service, often ascribed to the the impact of staffing shortages, and difficulties in finding appropriate placements for children and young people.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement. The recruitment and retention of social workers is a priority for Tusla, and in that regard there is a significant amount of work being done, both by Tusla and my officials, to increase the recruitment of social workers.  </p></reply>

This total may be further broken down into the number of children in each placement type, as follows: </p><p>- Special care: 17 children</p><p>- General residential care: 430 children</p><p>- General foster care:  3,782 children</p><p>- Relative foster care: 1,489 children</p><p>- Other care placements: 123 children. </p><p>With regard to the Deputy's question concerning the quality of various forms of alternative care, there are a wide range of safety and quality assurance controls in place to provide oversight of the quality and safety of placements for children in care. Tusla and my Department are committed to promoting safe practice in all areas of alternative care.</p><p>Once a child has been received into care, the most crucial task for the social worker is to find a placement that matches that child's needs.

A key part of the social worker role is to develop, in consultation with the child and relevant others, a care plan which will guide the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits. </p><p>Regulations and Standards govern the placement of children in care.  These provide for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions. The Regulations also provide that the allocated social worker oversees the implementation of the child's  care plan, visits the child and consults with family members, foster carers and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal.</p><p>HIQA has an independent statutory function under the 2004 Health Act requiring this independent statutory agency to inspect and monitor Tusla fostering and residential services. HIQA carries out announced and unannounced inspections of children&rsquo;s services including Child Protection and Welfare Services, Foster Care Services, statutory Children&rsquo;s Residential Centres and Special Care units. Tusla&rsquo;s Alternative Care Inspection and Monitoring Service carries out themed inspections of non-statutory (private) residential and fostering services, in line with HIQA standards. In addition, Tusla Alternative Care Inspection and Monitoring Service provides internal monitoring of the quality of care in its statutory centres.</p><p>Tusla&rsquo;s Performance management system reviews the key performance metrics relating to services provided to children in state care, reporting on children in care with an up-to-date written care plan, reviewed regularly and the allocation of a social worker to children in care and the allocation of fostering link social workers to foster carers. In 2020 Tusla&rsquo;s Practice Assurance and Service Monitoring (PASM) team conducted a programme of 134 practice audits of Tusla child protection and welfare, alternative care and children's residential care services. Tusla also operates a range of internal quality assurance processes within local areas including:</p><p>- an incident and risk management policy, </p><p>- systems to review significant events and incidents for the purpose of monitoring, </p><p>- service improvement and learning processes,</p><p>- and the complaints and feedback policy &lsquo;Tell Us&rsquo;. </p><p>The foregoing sets out the safeguards in place with regard to all placements of children in care. Tusla in discharging its statutory responsibilities under the Child Care Acts must have the best interests of the child as its paramount consideration. It actively monitors every placement of every child in care to ensure its appropriateness to the needs of that child, and any concerns or breaches of standards are addressed in this context.</p></reply>

It brings together State and non-State actors to implement change across 76 targeted actions, including measures to promote social inclusion, to improve access to public services and to address racism and xenophobia.</p><p>While initially due to conclude in 2020, the Migrant Integration Strategy was extended to the end of 2021 in recognition of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation. My Department is commissioning an independent evaluation of all equality strategies due to conclude this year, the findings of which will inform the development of the future strategic approach to equality policies. I anticipate that a consultation process to develop a new strategic policy for migrant integration will begin early in 2022.</p><p>A number of funding streams have been made available by my Department to support migrants, or persons of migrant origin, to participate on an equal basis with those of Irish heritage.</p><p>Under the National Integration Fund 2020, a total of &euro;2.2 million has been made available over a three year period to support 18 integration projects nationwide. These projects aim to increase mutual understanding between local communities and migrants; combat racism and xenophobia; promote the integration of vulnerable or socially-excluded immigrants and encourage the involvement of migrants in sport, volunteering and cultural activities.</p><p>In addition, the Communities Integration Fund provides small grant funding (&euro;1,000 - &euro;5,000 per project) to local community-based projects to support migrant integration. Following a competitive open call in 2021, 111 local community-based organisations nationwide have been selected to receive grant funding under the Communities Integration Fund totalling &euro;497,772.</p><p>Both the National Integration Fund and Communities Integration Fund arose from actions contained within the Migrant Integration Strategy.</p></reply>

Its purpose is to promote and protect human rights and equality in Ireland and build a culture of respect for human rights, equality and intercultural understanding in the State. In mid-October 2020 the transfer took place of the Governance function of IHREC from the Department of Justice and Equality to my Department. </p>  <p>  Significant advances have been made in recent years to address inequality in Irish society, with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fostering a diverse, inclusive and equal society re-affirmed through the Programme for Government commitments to achieve social solidarity, equality of opportunity and economic equity for all.</p>  <p>  The suite of national equality strategies, overseen and coordinated by my Department, act as the central policy framework adopted by Government to address inequality across Irish society. The strategies include the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS), the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG), the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS), the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, the National LGBTI+ Strategy for Youth and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES).</p>  <p>  The implementation of each equality strategy is overseen by a steering committee which draws together State and non-State actors to deliver a better quality of life for all through targeted actions to promote social inclusion and improved access to public services. I chair the meetings of the committees charged with the monitoring and oversight of the strategies, with the exception of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy steering group which is chaired by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte T.D., and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities which is chaired by Fergus Finlay.</p>  <p>  As some of these strategies near their conclusion, I will work with stakeholders to examine what has been achieved over their term and how we can bring forth the next iterations of those strategies and ensure they are even more robust and effective. </p>  <p>  In June of this year I announced my intention to conduct a review of the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts to examine the functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combatting discrimination and in promoting equality, including awareness of the legislation and whether there are obstacles to taking an action under the Acts.

The guidance, which was fully revised in October 2017 to include reference to the provisions of the Act, is intended to assist members of the public, professionals, employees or volunteers in identifying and reporting concerns about child abuse and neglect to Tusla.   </p>  <p>  - Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, assesses all child welfare and protection concerns that are reported to it and takes appropriate action. If Tusla suspects that a crime has been committed and a child has been wilfully neglected or physically or sexually abused, it will formally notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without delay.   </p>  <p>  Tusla also has a dedicated social work team for Separated Children Seeking International Protection (SCSIP). Over the past 20 years the SCSIP Team has developed expertise through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in International Refugee Protection Programmes and by caring for the greater number of separated children seeking international protection who arrive unannounced at Irish ports and airports. The majority of unaccompanied children arriving in Ireland are over 15 years old and need significant educational, language and, in many instances, therapeutic supports. The on-going social work assessment is multi-disciplinary in nature and involves a medical examination, an educational assessment and a child protection risk assessment. A statutory care plan is developed and, if appropriate, an application for asylum is made on behalf of the child. After assessment, children are placed in the most appropriate placement option depending on their assessed needs. In 2020, Tusla received 80 referrals for Separated Children Seeking International Protection and of that number 51 children were received into the statutory care of Tusla.  </p>  <p>  - In February 2021, my Department published A White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service. This White Paper outlines the proposed new system of accommodation and supports that will be offered to applicants for International Protection and is the result of an extensive consultation process with Civil Society Organisations, residents of Direct Provision centres, and other Government Departments and Bodies.     </p>  <p>  The new system is based on a series of principles which is centred on a Human Rights approach with a focus on dignity, respect and privacy for all. There will be a particular focus on vulnerable applicants including victims of trafficking. This focus includes providing specific accommodation for both female and male victims of trafficking and ensuring all appropriate health and social care supports are available.</p></reply>

My Department and the Child and Family Agency, Tusla are working with the Department of Justice in the development of this strategy to focus on the needs of victims and to recognise the experiences of men, women and children who may under threat from DSGBV.</p><p>My Department has a broad remit in its responsibilities towards children and families. Child Protection is a key concern. Children First provides a strong statutory framework for reporting concerns that a child might be at risk of abuse or neglect. Tusla works closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in responding to reported concerns, including those relating to women and children at risk from DSGBV.</p><p>Tusla has a statutory role to support victims of DSGBV. Tusla funds 60 organisations that deliver services for these victims, including 21 services that provide emergency refuge and non-refuge accommodation. Other funded organisations provide community-based domestic violence services and rape crisis services. In 2021, Tusla's funding of DSGBV services amounted to &euro;28 million, with an additional &euro;2 million of one-off contingency funding being made available to help services cope with the ongoing effects of COVID-19. </p><p>My Department has provided once off funding in 2021 under the &quot;What Works&quot; initiative to organisations for projects and programmes to support children and adults affected by DSGBV. The funded projects included professional development and training for staff, development of a resource pack to enhance awareness for frontline practitioners and strengthening data to build targeted prevention and early intervention strategies.</p><p>With regard to children in care of the State, the Deputy may be familiar with the Child Care Law Report Project (CCLRP) that assists the State in our learning from the experiences of children and families in child care proceedings. In a recent report titled 'Ripe for Reform', which was commissioned by my Department, amongst other themes, the report considered the impact of domestic violence and domestic homicide on those children subject to child care proceedings. These findings, and other recommendations in the report, span the remit of a number of Government Departments. For example, the authors highlight concerns in respect of guardianship matters in cases where one parent kills the other. In such cases the surviving parent is the sole remaining legal guardian until a full care order is made. I will ensure that the report is brought to the attention of the relevant authorities, and will follow up as required.  </p><p>Tusla carefully monitors all referrals to the Agency. The risk of DSGBV may not be evident at the time of referral and is not easily captured as a statistic. The most recently available data shows a rise in the proportion of all child protection and welfare referrals relating to emotional abuse. Looking to annual trends (Table 1), emotional abuse increased from 33% of all child protection referrals, in 2014 to 43% in 2020, and is notably the largest proportion of all four abuse types.

In that context, the High Level Group which produced and published a discussion document on the management of convicted sex offenders was not in favour of the use of polygraphs for monitoring/risk assessment purposes as views in other countries were divided on the practice. The group also had concerns of a practical and legal nature. </p><p>Consequently, polygraph testing is not included in the current proposals.  However, the matter will be kept under review in the light of experience of the implementation of such measures in the UK.</p></reply>

My Department continues to work closely with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to ensure a coordinated national response.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Government has approved my Department's proposal for an additional initiative: the special Afghan Admission Programme, which will provide places for up to 500 Afghan family members to travel to Ireland. Each applicant will have an opportunity to nominate up to four family members who are currently residing in Afghanistan or who have fled to neighbouring territories and whom they consider would be especially at risk in terms of their freedom and safety. </p>  <p>  My Department intends to open the Programme for applications during mid-December.</p>  <p>  A key focus of the Programme will be on establishing the identity of those intending to come to Ireland. Therefore, in advance of the Programme&rsquo;s launch date, applicants and beneficiaries should focus on ensuring they have as many identity documents as possible.</p>  <p>  The creation of this Programme is unique to date in the EU and was welcomed by the UNHCR as a very welcome commitment by Ireland that will bring much needed solace to Afghans here who are worried about their relatives abroad.</p>  <p>   In the meantime, I want to assure the Deputy that all current immigration avenues remain open for new applications, including visa and family reunification applications. More than 750 Afghan nationals have already been granted permissions to reside in the State so far this year and my Department will continue to process any new applications received speedily and sympathetically.  </p></reply>

The survey provides information on alcohol, tobacco, and drug use amongst the general population in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The survey findings show that, overall, the use of illegal drugs has remained at a similar level to that recorded in the 2014/15 survey, while an increase was seen in the use of cocaine and ecstasy. Cannabis, while being the most prevalent illegal drug in Ireland, has also shown a decrease from 6.5% to 5.9% when compared to the 2014/15 survey. A significant decrease in the instances of Cannabis Use Disorder has also been recorded.</p>  <p>  Our national drug strategy recognises the need to strengthen early harm reduction responses to current and emerging trends and patterns of drug use. The recently completed mid-term review of the strategy shows significant progress in implementing the action plan for the period 2017 to 2020, with only a small number of the 50 actions outstanding. Access and availability of drug services have been improved, particularly services for women, people who are homeless, and those with heroin addiction. A new clinical programme for dual diagnosis has been developed and the Government is championing an alternative health-led approach for the possession of drugs for personal use. </p>  <p>  As part of the mid-term review six strategic priorities have been identified for the remaining years of the strategy until 2025. These will strengthen the health-led approach to drug use, as agreed in the Programme for Government, and align with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan. </p>  <p>  These priorities will protect children and young people from drug use and the associated harms and enhance community care for people who use drugs by providing health and social care services at the community level to meet identified health needs.  </p>  <p>  To support the implementation of the strategic priorities, I provided additional funding of &euro;6m for new health measures in Budget 2022.</p></reply>

The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures, including scoliosis spinal fusions, can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.</p>  <p>  More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.</p>  <p>  Funding proposals submitted to the HSE by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to increase capacity and activity for both orthopaedic and scoliosis patients are considered under the HSE National Service Plan 2022 and under the HSE Capital Plan. Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for me and my Department as we work to finalise next years&rsquo; Service Plan.</p>  <p>  Improving waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures remains a commitment of this Government. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p></reply>

The Apprenticeship Council (or its successor the National Apprenticeship Alliance) then approve the programme for development and associated funding where the proposal meets certain criteria.   It is not a matter of a certain cohort of workers being &lsquo;eligible&rsquo; for apprenticeship, but a matter of the sector developing an appropriate education and training response to an identified skill need.  </p>  <p>  The presence of an apprenticeship in a sector does not drive employment or address labour shortages.  Apprenticeship, in common with other education and training options, can support the widening of a recruitment base, retention of staff and deliver the skills needed once a learner is available and willing to work towards a qualification and the associated work-ready competency which apprenticeship delivers.</p>  <p>  My colleague the Minister for Mental Health and Older People has committed to establishing a Cross Departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group. The role of the group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and examine workforce challenges in home support and nursing homes. Potential areas to be considered include recruitment, retention, training, and the career development of home support and nursing home workers into the future.  </p></reply>

In 2017, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) delivered a health technology assessment (HTA) of the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical smoking cessation products and services. In relation to the safety of e-cigarettes, the HIQA assessment concluded that this remains an evolving area of research and that while potentially safer than smoking evidence on long-term safety had yet to be established.</p>  <p>  In October of last year, the Health Research Board published the findings of its evidence review on electronic cigarettes. The review focused on the evidence available on three topics; the effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, electronic cigarette use as a gateway to subsequent smoking in adolescents, and on the health harms and benefits of electronic cigarettes and heat - not - burn tobacco products.</p>  <p>  The evidence review found that e-cigarettes are not harmless but that they are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes, that e-cigarettes are as effective as nicotine replacement therapies for smoking cessation up to 6 months and that there is a positive association between e-cigarette use and subsequent smoking in adolescents.</p>  <p>  The review also made clear that further research was needed on the effects of alternatives such as heat - not - burn tobacco products as there is currently insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about these products.</p>  <p>  The findings of the Health Research Board's research on the use of electronic cigarettes by adolescents underscore the importance of the proposed Public Health (Tobacco and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill. The Bill will further regulate nicotine inhaling products by prohibiting their sale to and by persons under the age of 18 and by introducing a licensing system for the retail sale of these products. </p></reply>

Overall smoking prevalence declined by 6% between 2015 and 2019 indicating that increasing numbers of people are successfully quitting long-term.</p><p>In relation to relapse rates, the 2019 Survey identified that 46% of those who smoked in that year made an attempt to quit with 25% successfully quitting. The 2019 survey found that 52% of successful quitters did not use any quitting aids, with 38% using e-cigarettes and 10% using nicotine replacement therapies.</p><p>While the 2020 survey could not be conducted due to COVID-19 a survey was carried out in 2021 and its findings will be published shortly.</p><p>Reducing relapse rates amongst those who have quit smoking is an important part of the overall framework to reduce tobacco-related harm as part of <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>. Measures introduced to achieve a reduction in smoking prevalence generally will equally apply to those who have quit smoking and subsequently relapsed; these include access to cessation services, roll out of mass media campaigns under the HSE QUIT programme, increases in the cost of tobacco products and regulation of the retail environment. The Tobacco Free Ireland 2020 Annual Report which was published in September provides details on the progress made in these areas in 2020.</p></reply>

A major milestone was reached in July 2019, when the Urgent Care Centre at the Connolly Hospital campus opened, providing a new model of ambulatory care for children. A second major milestone was reached when the second satellite centre, at Tallaght, was completed in line with contractor&rsquo;s schedule and formally opened on 15 November 2021.</p><p>Despite delays, work on the new children&rsquo;s hospital building at St James&rsquo;s is now progressing well with the outer shell almost complete. The infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame, closing in the concourse, is now complete and the building will be essentially weathertight by end of the year. The fit out of most internal areas is now underway.  </p><p>The current programme scheduled by the contractor outlines a revised substantial completion date for the main hospital of December 2023. If the contractor can meet its own schedule, the new hospital could open in 2024, after the necessary period of commissioning.</p><p>Like many other sectors of the economy, the construction sector has been severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and progress on the main building at St James&rsquo;s campus was delayed. In addition, the sector is challenged by Brexit and global supply chain issues, but the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) and contractors are working hard to mitigate those risks. However, those externalities make more definitive forecasting unwise. </p><p>The NPHDB has the statutory responsibility and resources to plan, design, build, furnish and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital and continues to engage with the main contractor to achieve delivery of the Programme within the shortest possible timeframe.</p></reply>

HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p><p>The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The role of the Drugs Group is to make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) in relation to each individual application having considered the criteria under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. </p><p>The Drugs Group considers the NCPE assessment, the outputs from commercial engagements, patient interest group submissions, any inputs provided by the Rare Disease Technology Review Committee and any other pertinent information in advance of providing its recommendation to the HSE EMT.</p><p>As the decision-making authority within the HSE, the HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. </p><p>While the 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a different ruleset when assessing orphan medicines, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to take account of evidence of the benefits associated with each given medicine. The budget allocation of &euro;30m funding for new medicines in Budget 2022 will provide for the reimbursement of both orphan and non-orphan medicines. </p><p>The number of orphan drugs currently under assessment is an operational issue. I have therefore referred this matter to the HSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy. </p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p>  <p>  The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups on 18th November, to take a series of immediate actions which include a 14 day period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work in particular in Model 4 hospitals. The situation is to be reviewed after that period.</p>  <p>  On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack. In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.</p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of October 2021 there were 4,717 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,452 in October 2018.</p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular queries raised, regarding where surgery is available for the removal of cataracts and the number of procedures that have taken place in the last twelve months, as these are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This will enable all stakeholders make the necessary business and/or infrastructural adjustments that will ensure compliance with the Regulations. </p><p>The move has been well received by all stakeholders and I thank all of them for their continued positive engagement in the matter. </p><p>While the new National Veterinary Prescription System (NVPS) will be in place as planned for the end of January, its mandatory use will also be delayed until 1st June to allow for a smooth transition to compliance. for this same period.</p><p>The new veterinary medicines regulations are focused on ensuring increased availability of veterinary medicines across the EU, as well as addressing the key societal One Health One Welfare challenges of anti-microbial resistance, as well as anti-parasitic resistance.</p><p>The roadmap is as follows:</p><p>1. The Regulations come into effect on 28<sup>th</sup>January. </p><p>2. The new requirements regarding the prescribing of antimicrobials, including antibiotics,  and medicated feed, will come into effect on that date.</p><p>3. The requirement to only supply anti-parasitic medicines on foot of a veterinary prescription is deferred for a four-month period &ndash; until 1<sup>st</sup>June 2022. A prescription will not be required for such products until that date.</p><p>4. The national mandatory requirement to use the NVPS is deferred until 1<sup>st</sup>June 2022. Veterinary practitioners can continue to issue paper-based prescriptions in the current format until then.</p><p>5. The NVPS will be available for voluntary use by vets from the end of January onwards &ndash; to ensure that prescribers and dispensers are familiar with the system when its use becomes compulsory.</p><p>6. Prescriptions issued by vets for anti-parasitic medicines after 1<sup>st</sup>June will be valid for a maximum period of 12-months. Antiparasitic medicines can then be purchased by the farmer from his or her preferred supplier at the appropriate time throughout the period that the prescription is valid.</p><p>7. From 1<sup>st</sup>June 2022, the Regulations will be applied in full.</p><p>I have asked my officials to explore the issue of interchangeable anti-parasitics, and more information will be available on this in the coming weeks. I have made these amendments to help farmers, vets, pharmacists and licensed merchants transition to the new regulations. </p></reply>
