    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-31a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013100046#WRA00600"><p>The Government&rsquo;s current programme to combat &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo; is set out in the package of &ldquo;Measures to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s corporate, economic and regulatory framework&rdquo;, which was published on 2 November 2017. That package is designed to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a country with a top tier business environment is underpinned by a robust framework to combat corporate, economic and regulatory offences.  </p>  <p>  My Department has lead responsibility for delivery of 4 of the measures, all of which include the preparation of new legislation. </p>  <p>  One of the key measures in the Government&rsquo;s programme is the establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement as an agency that is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law. Giving effect to this decision requires new primary legislation to amend the Companies Act 2014.  Accordingly, a General Scheme of the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill was published on 4 December 2018. That Scheme has been submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation for its consideration for Pre-Legislative Scrutiny. Subject to the outcome of the Joint Committee&rsquo;s Pre-Legislative Scrutiny, the General Scheme is to be drafted as a priority, with a view to publication this year. </p>  <p>  Another measure in the Government&rsquo;s programme to tackle &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo; is to examine the Company Law Review Group&rsquo;s Report on Corporate Governance and to bring forward proposals, including for legislative change. My Department reviewed the CLRG&rsquo;s recommendations last year and, as a result, proposals for legislative change are included in Part 4 of the General Scheme of the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill.  These are intended to clarify certain corporate governance and other issues affecting the administration of company meetings. </p>  <p>  The third measure assigned to the Department is the transposition of the Shareholders Rights Directive (Directive 2017/828). This Directive establishes specific requirements to encourage long term shareholder engagement and increase corporate transparency. Draft Regulations to give effect to this commitment were submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel last November and my Department is engaged with that Office on the drafting and settlement of those Regulations. </p>  <p>  Finally, the package of measures includes a commitment to enact the Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill 2017. Again, my Department worked with the Parliamentary Counsel on the preparation of that Bill and the drafting of amendments to enhance the oversight and supervisory powers of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.  The Bill was enacted as the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act 2018 in July 2018 and virtually all sections were commenced in September 2018. </p></reply>

The first North-East/North-West Regional Action Plan for Jobs was launched on the 30th November 2015, and the refreshed plans for the North-East and North-West will have separate Regional Enterprise Plans and both of these will launch on the 25th February 2019. </p>  <p>  In 2018, Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Sligo employed 1,916 people, a 7% increase on the 2017 employment figure. Enterprise Ireland is actively working with companies with global ambition in Sligo to drive competitiveness, innovation and market diversification.</p>  <p>  Through the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, Enterprise Ireland has invested &euro;60 million in 42 projects. Sligo County Enterprise Fund were approved for &euro;1.9m for a development in Strandhill.  The project focuses on the development of the Strand Campus to operate as a leading location for entrepreneurs in digital gaming and associated tech sectors, providing holistic support for start-up, innovation and growth.</p>  <p>  The &euro;953k funding for the Leitrim Enterprise Food Zone will help develop and incubate food companies across the region including Sligo. State of the art facilities, a network manager and tailored programmes will drive the success and scale of food start-ups in Sligo and Leitrim.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also works with the Institutes of Technology to support entrepreneurship in the regions. There are 7 new companies from Sligo IT completing the Enterprise Ireland New Frontiers Programme at present and it is expected that these will progress to either Enterprise Ireland or the Local Enterprise Offices for further support and development.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office (LEO) in Sligo is the 'first-stop-shop' for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports if you intend to start or grow a business in the area. Employment in LEO supported firms in Sligo increased 5% in 2017. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland markets County Sligo as part of the North-West region which includes Leitrim and Donegal. I am pleased that all three counties have seen net job gains with FDI employment in the North-West region increasing by 3% between 2017 and 2018.</p>  <p>  Sligo is home to a number of prominent multinational companies who have shown a significant level of commitment to the County with companies such as Abbott Ireland, Abbvie and GSK continuing to perform well. </p>  <p>  The IDA continues to work hard to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in Sligo. As part of the pilot phase of its Regional Property Programme in 2016, the IDA constructed an Advanced Technology Building in Sligo and successfully secured Abbott Ireland as a tenant.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, my Department secured an additional &euro;10 million for the Regional Property Programme a further building is planned for Sligo. This Regional Property Programme has supported the creation of hundreds of jobs to date and this is a positive reflection of the IDA&rsquo;s proactive investment in property solutions in regional locations such as Sligo.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-31a.13.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013100046#WRA01200"><p>My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks. I am very aware of the specific vulnerabilities of key sectors such as agri-food, construction products and engineering sectors to Brexit, and no more so than in the Border counties.   </p>  <p>  The Regional Enterprise Plans are crucial in meeting the Government's ambition to create an additional 200,00 jobs, of which 135,000 are outside the Dublin region, by 2020. The first North-East/North-West Regional Action Plan for Jobs was launched on the 30th November 2015, and the refreshed plans for the North-East and North-West will have separate Regional Enterprise Plans and both of these will launch on the 25th February 2019.  </p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign, including a recent event held in Monaghan in October where I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border region. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready event in Letterkenny in Donegal on Friday 30 November last, which included Enterprise Ireland, Industrial Development Authority (IDA), the Local Enterprise Office's (LEOs), National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) and the Health &amp;amp; Safety Authority (HSA).  Last week, the Revenue Commissioners held a seminar in Dundalk. The seminar focused on customs requirements, procedures and operation of the UK landbridge and transit arrangements.  This week the NSAI hosted Brexit information events in Cavan, Monaghan and Sligo and further events are being planned by my Department and agencies. The NSAI plays an important standards and certification function for the construction products and engineering sectors, so these events in the Border area are very beneficial. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has a wide range of supports available and are actively engaged with companies in helping them to prepare. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, I allocated an additional &euro;1million to InterTradeIreland (ITI). The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading post-Brexit. ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, worth up to &euro;2,250, for professional advice on preparing for Brexit. </p>  <p>  The LEOs in the Border regions are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business and preparing for Brexit. Some 402 LEO clients benefitted from one-to-one Brexit mentoring. I allocated  additional capital funding of &euro;5 million in Budget 2019 to the LEOs to step-up their Brexit preparedness work. </p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme, to help firms to innovate, differentiate and compete. </p>  <p>  In December, I announced Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). Taking the first and second calls of the REDF together, the Border region has seven successful projects with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million.</p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides working capital for up to three years, to eligible businesses to mitigate their Brexit challenges. The Brexit Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019 and will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit. </p>  <p>  Last week I announced the Enterprise Ireland  Annual Results where every region in Ireland recorded increases in employment, including a 9% increase in the North West and a 3% increase in the North East. Over 23,700 of the 215,207 employed in supported companies are in the Border region. Some of the recent EI jobs announcements for the region have included 90 new jobs in E &amp;amp; I Engineering in Donegal and 200 new jobs in Combilift in Co. Monaghan. </p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a new Customs online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-31a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013100046#WRA01500"><p>I am very well aware of the skills shortages currently being experienced in the construction sector. The issue is all the more pressing given the strong economic growth being experienced and the high demand being placed on the sector to respond to a range of construction needs across the economy. I have also met with Construction Industry Federation representatives to discuss the labour and skills challenges in the sector.   </p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List (HSEOL) and the Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL). These lists are reviewed twice yearly to keep pace with rapid labour market changes and to be proactively identifying and addressing shortages as they arise.  </p>  <p>  A review of the occupation lists is being currently being finalised and my officials, in consultation with officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is actively considering the 50 submissions received including a detailed submission from the Construction Industry Federation. I expect, in the very short term, to receive proposals, based on the evidence presented and extensive consultation with the Interdepartmental Group on Economic Migration, for changes to both the ineligible and highly skilled occupational lists. </p>  <p>  It is currently taking 6 weeks to process applications for trusted partners and 15 weeks for standard applications.  My Department is taking steps to improve these processing times. The main reason for the delays is the high levels of demand last year for employment permits, due to our economic success, growing labour market and reduced labour surplus.  </p>  <p>  At the end of December some 16,800 applications were received which were approx. 30% higher than 2017. Over the same period some 13,400 permits were granted representing an almost 20% increase over last year. Quarter 4 in 2018 saw the highest number of permits issued in any quarter in the previous 10 years.</p>  <p>  There are currently approximately 2,110 permit applications in the processing queue down from a peak of 3,230 in September 2018. Through a combination of increased resources, staff working overtime and  ICT and  operational improvements, processing times are now at 5 weeks for Trusted Partners, and 15 weeks for standard applications. Further improvements are expected in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  As well as the short-term measures introduced to date, the development of a new IT system is being explored which will take advantage of all the new technologies available, including full digitization.  In parallel with this new development, my Department is determined to continue to reduce processing times and is engaging extensively with stakeholders to ensure that they are fully aware of the situation. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-31a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013100046#WRA01800"><p>Regional development remains an absolute priority of mine. I am focused on both supporting and sustaining current regional employers and working to create new economic and job opportunities across the country. The recent performance of IDA Ireland, the State Agency tasked with promoting inward investment into Ireland, demonstrates the progress we are making in this context. By the end of last year, total employment in the IDA&rsquo;s client companies stood at 229,057, the highest on record. Every region in Ireland has seen foreign direct investment (FDI) employment gains and there are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin. I am determined, together with the IDA, to see this trend continue and we will be doing everything possible in 2019 to encourage more firms to invest further in the regions. </p>  <p>  Donegal has benefitted from this strong regional focus. The County has experienced a 60% increase in FDI-driven employment since 2012, with job numbers in IDA client firms there increasing from 2,223 in 2012 to 3,564 at the end of last year. In 2018 alone, the total of IDA supported jobs in Donegal increased by 5%, with the County now home to 12 IDA companies including SITA, Optibelt and Pramerica. </p>  <p>  As regards new-name investors, the general trend is reasonably positive especially in the context of the strong performance of the IDA clients already located in Donegal.  There was 1 new name investment in 2009 in Donegal representing 2.5% of the national total in that year.  In 2010 there were no new name investments in the County.  In 2011 there was one new investment out of a total of 61 such investments nationally, giving a percentage of 1.6% of national new name investment.  In 2012 there was also one new investment in Donegal out of 65 nationally, which is 1.5% of the total figure.  Between 2013 and 2018 there has been no new name investments in County Donegal. Those statistics, however, only serve to emphasise that FDI performance is not accurately measured by the number of new-name investors, given Donegal&rsquo;s strong performance &ndash; as outlined above &ndash; over the last decade.   </p>  <p>  With respect to the year ahead, the indications are that FDI in Donegal will continue to increase. For example, Abbott Laboratories announced plans last July to expand its workforce in the County with the creation of 500 new jobs. The IDA is already working hard to attract further such high-quality investment to Donegal, thereby creating more jobs and economic opportunities for the region. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the Agency are also directly investing, through their regional property programme, in property solutions to attract more FDI to regional Ireland. This programme has a particular focus on the Border and Midlands regions. Three buildings are planned for the Border area and I am confident, once completed, that they will help attract further overseas firms to the region </p>  <p>  While clear progress has been made in creating new jobs and economic opportunity in Donegal, the Government is determined to achieve more. We will continue working hard in 2019, whether in support of indigenous or overseas enterprise, to help create more employment for the County.</p></reply>

In 2018, for example, 56% of all net new jobs created by the Agency were in locations outside Dublin. Similarly, every region in Ireland, including the Border Region, posted net gains in jobs last year. There are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies outside the capital. In fact, 58% of all IDA-supported employment is now outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed in the regions by IDA clients in the Agency&rsquo;s history.    </p>  <p>  While there were no new foreign direct investment (FDI) supported jobs created in Cavan in 2018, Monaghan experienced an 8% increase in FDI employment, with 12 jobs added by companies in the County.  Similarly, Meath saw a 4.5% increase in IDA supported employment, with the creation of 67 new jobs last year. </p>  <p>  With regard to site visits, there were five to County Meath and one each to Counties Cavan and Monaghan in the first three quarters of 2018. Data on the number of site visits for the last three months of year will become available shortly. </p>  <p>  While more work remains to be done, the Border region has benefitted from the IDA's regional focus. The area experienced a 3% growth in employment by overseas companies in 2018 and we are already working hard to increase this figure in 2019. As part of that work, the IDA are directly investing in a building programme to help ensure property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding outside our major cities. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, I allocated an additional &euro;10m for the next phase of the IDA Regional Property Programme. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that programme includes plans for an Advanced Technology Unit (ATU) at Knockaconny, County Monaghan. The IDA are currently in the process of procuring a design and delivery team for this facility.</p>  <p>  The wider Border region will also benefit, with new buildings planned for Dundalk and Sligo, which I am confident will help generate new opportunities for the wider area. </p>  <p>  The Agency has a dedicated regional manager for the North East/North West Region and an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre. As part of its strategy to promote the area, it is focusing on sectors including agri-food, manufacturing, tourism and internationally traded services. The IDA regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. County Meath is being actively marketed by the IDA as a location for second sites for multinationals in the Dublin region, with a focus on building clusters in existing sectors like high-value manufacturing and international services.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. Both Monaghan and Cavan have seen promising growth in the numbers employed in Enterprise Ireland-backed firms, with increases of 5% and 6% respectively. County Meath has seen a 4% increase in EI-backed businesses. The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are also performing well, with net increases of 100 jobs, 142 jobs and 162 jobs in LEO-supported companies in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath respectively in 2017. </p>  <p>  Another example of the success of this Government's strategy for regional job creation is Combilift's new &euro;50 million Research &amp;amp; Development and Testing Centre in County Monaghan. This new investment will create 200 jobs and represents a home-grown success story. The positive impact that Combilift has on the county and the border area cannot be underestimated.     </p>  <p>  We recognise that there is room for improvement in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath and we are working hard, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of these counties. The Enterprise Agencies under my remit will continue to engage with their clients, and with one another, to create jobs and source new investment in 2019.</p></reply>

Overall expenditure on R&amp;D in Ireland has been increasing steadily since 2012 and is estimated to have reached almost &euro;3.4 billion in 2017, the highest figure on record. </p>  <p>  In 2011, under the European Commission&rsquo;s Europe 2020 agenda, Ireland committed to raise gross investment in R&amp;D to 2.5% of GNP by 2020. We reiterated this commitment as one of our key measurements in Innovation 2020. </p>  <p>  The details supplied by the Deputy are based on recent figures published by Eurostat. The Gross Expenditure on R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP intensity rate of 1.05% of GDP for 2017 is calculated using preliminary figures for Business Expenditure on R&amp;D and Higher Education Expenditure on R&amp;D. Updated surveys on both are due to be published later this year from the CSO and my Department respectively and will give the full picture on R&amp;D expenditure for 2017. It should be noted that the Eurostat report uses GDP rather than GNP as the basis for comparison across the EU. Our current estimate for R&amp;D investment in 2017 is 1.46% of GNP, as per my Department&rsquo;s latest R&amp;D Budget publication.</p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge that Ireland continues to perform well in international studies &ndash; we rose to 9th in the 2018 European Innovation Scoreboard. In the European Innovation Scoreboard 2018, Ireland remains in the category of &ldquo;Strong Innovator&rdquo; and has moved up a place to 9th in the EU. Ireland is placed first in three out of the ten dimensions considered - innovative SMEs, employment in knowledge-intensive activities and sales due to innovation activities. Ireland is ranked higher than 12 other member states that invest a higher amount of public funds as a percentage of GDP.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also retained 10th place in the Global Innovation Index, out of 126 countries assessed.</p></reply>

We are working in all regions, no more so than in the Border counties where there are very specific vulnerabilities due to the integrated nature of business supply chains, labour markets and day-to-day commerce.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government's overall Brexit information outreach, my Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign, including in Monaghan in October and in Letterkenny in November last. Revenue held a customs seminar in Dundalk last week. This week the NSAI is hosting Brexit events in Cavan, Monaghan and Sligo and further events are in planning by my Department and agencies. </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, I allocated an additional &euro;1million to InterTradeIreland (ITI). The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading post-Brexit. ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, worth up to &euro;2,250, for professional advice on preparing for Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in the Border Regions are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business and preparing for Brexit. To date, 402 LEO clients have received one-to-one Brexit mentoring. I allocated an additional capital funding of &euro;5 million in Budget 2019 to the LEOs to step-up their Brexit preparedness work. </p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme, to help firms to innovate, differentiate and compete. </p>  <p>  In December, I announced Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). Taking the first and second calls of the REDF together, the Border Region had seven successful projects with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million.</p>  <p>  I will also shortly be launching the refresh of the North-West and the North-East Action Plans for Jobs and Brexit will be an ongoing priority area for both Committees. </p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides working capital for up to three years, to eligible businesses to adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. The Brexit Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019 and will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit. </p>  <p>  Last week I announced the Enterprise Ireland (EI) Annual Results where every region in Ireland recorded increases in employment, including a 9% increase in the North West and a 3% increase in the North East. Over 23,700 of employment in EI clients of 215,207 are in the Border region. Some of the recent EI jobs announcements for the region have included 90 new jobs in E &amp;amp; I Engineering in Donegal and 200 new jobs in Combilift in Co. Monaghan. </p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a new Customs online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work.  </p>  <p>  Last week I met with European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager and she assured me the Commission stands ready to work with us to support Brexit viable but vulnerable firms.   </p>  <p>  With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help.</p></reply>

While I understand some US firms in Ireland have repatriated such financial resources since that legislation came into force, there has been little discernible impact on their actual operations here.</p>  <p>  I understand that the figure referred to of &euro;106 billion represents only a preliminary estimate. Finalised figures from UNCTAD will be made available later in the year. </p>  <p>  I am confident, despite recent changes to the American taxation system, that US and international firms will continue to locate or expand further in Ireland. Our strengths &ndash; including our pro-enterprise policy environment, highly-educated workforce and competitive taxation regime &ndash; remain attractive to international investors. Indeed, the IDA&rsquo;s record results for 2018 reflect an active and healthy pipeline of investment into the country. The Agency, for example, secured 265 investments for 2018 compared with 237 for 2017. Total employment in IDA client firms now stands at approximately 230,000. </p>  <p>  Despite these positive FDI trends, the Government is focused on our need to remain as competitive as possible. A new five-year strategy for IDA Ireland, for example, will be prepared this year to ensure the Agency remains able to compete for, and secure, more first-rate investment projects and to meet other challenges ahead. The Government will also continue working to make sure that Ireland remains a favoured destination for high-quality and job-rich investment projects. </p></reply>

The package of Brexit supports encompasses finance, advisory and awareness.  My Department's focus is on helping firms to improve their competitiveness and innovation, and to diversify markets.</p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are working to provide extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. The suite of enterprise and finance supports now in place covers the spectrum of potential Brexit impacts and aims to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p>  <p>  Over 3,700 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions to prepare for Brexit. EI has also hosted 11 Brexit Advisory Clinics.</p>  <p>  In addition, eligible EI client companies can respond to the threats and opportunities posed by Brexit by accessing the Agile Innovation Fund.  This fund supports clients to quickly develop innovations and respond to opportunities and threats in new and existing markets. The new Fund allows companies to access up to 50% in support of innovation projects with a total cost of up to &euro;300,000. A recent EI survey showed that EI clients that have availed of Innovation Capability, Funding and Collaboration support saw a 67% increase in global sales.</p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a new Customs Insights Online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. </p>  <p>  In December, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). In order to help build the enterprise capability, under the REDF, I am particularly pleased that a number of new projects were successful from the Border counties, which are likely to more impacted by Brexit. EI is investing in seven successful REDF projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million. This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region.</p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland (ITI) works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. </p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the ITI Brexit Advisory Service. </p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms.  As of its most recent report and the end of November 2018, 811 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 657 have been approved.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events in every county to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, 402 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.</p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.</p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme. The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. </p>  <p>  In April 2017, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. This will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in all regions, and can be robust in addressing the challenges we face, including Brexit. As a result, both the North-West and the North-East will both have their own plans in the new iteration and Brexit will be an ongoing priority area for both Committees. These plans are being finalised and will be published in February. </p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme. </p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 18th January, there have been 376 eligibility applications received of which 337 eligibility applications have been approved and 65 loans progressed to sanction at Bank level to a value of &euro;14.9m.  Brexit impacted exporters account for almost 50% of approvals while manufacturing accounts for 38% of approvals and 20% of approved applications relate to investments in new products or markets.</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  The SBCI has issued an &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial institutions to apply by 11 February 2019 for designation as a lending partner under the Scheme. It is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.</p>  <p>  The majority of the above schemes are open to all SMEs, not just agency clients. My Department and its agencies will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. </p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario. </p></reply>

These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I made Brexit one of my top priorities in the allocations of funding for 2019 in my Department and I have allocated further funding to Brexit-related support from agencies and offices of my Department as part of Budget 2019. I have allocated an additional &euro;5 million capital funding to the Local Enterprise Offices, an increase of 22% for 2019, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTrade Ireland. ITI works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit, to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit.. I have allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland to expand their global footprints and drive the diversification of trade and investment. Additional resources have also been distributed across Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority and the NSAI for 2019 to support enterprises adjust to the new relationships with the UK and pursue new opportunities.</p>  <p>   Informed by detailed research, my Department has put in place a package of measures in response to the needs of businesses affected by Brexit-related uncertainty. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p>  <p>  Over 3,900 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions. EI is working closely with regionally-important larger companies in exposed sectors such as food to support strategic investments to build resilience &ndash; EI invested &euro;74 million in these businesses in 2018.</p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a new Customs Insights Online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. </p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, 471 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.</p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities, as of 18 January 2018, 419 LEO clients were approved assistance under the grant. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.</p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme. The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. </p>  <p>  In December, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). </p>  <p>  In April 2017, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. This will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in all regions, and can be robust in addressing the challenges we face, including Brexit. As a result, both the North-West and the North-East will both have their own plans in the new iteration and Brexit will be an ongoing priority area for both Committees. These plans are being finalised and will be published in February. </p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 18th January, there have been 376 eligibility applications received of which 337 eligibility applications have been approved and 65 loans progressed to sanction at Bank level to a value of &euro;14.9m. </p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  The SBCI has issued an &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial institutions to apply by 11 February 2019 for designation as a lending partner under the Scheme. It is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. A &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; event was recently held in Monaghan in October and I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready event in Letterkenny in Donegal on Friday 30 November last, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA.</p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario. </p></reply>

I am focused on both supporting and sustaining existing employment levels in regional Ireland while also working to create new economic opportunities and jobs in every county of Ireland. I am pleased to say that total employment in IDA Ireland's client companies now stands at 229,057, with 58% of all IDA employment outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the Agency.</p>  <p>  The IDA regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Counties Kildare and Meath including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base but also from the indigenous sector. The Agency also owns sites in both counties that are actively marketed to its clients through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas. I am confident that the ongoing work by the IDA in the region will lead to more investment and job creation for the wider area in due course.  </p>  <p>  Meath has seen a 4% increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) employment in the last year. There are now 19 IDA-supported client companies in the County employing 1,632 people. Meath continues to maintain a strong contingent of overseas firms in the Financial Services, Manufacturing and Biotechnology sectors with key clients such as ArcRoyal, International Fund Services and Alltech performing well in the County.  The client base there shows that the area remains an attractive destination for FDI and overseas firms. </p>  <p>  IDA client companies in County Kildare collectively employ 8,838 people, representing an increase of 4.5% over the previous year. The County is home to overseas firms in the Technology, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals sectors.  IDA clients such as Intel, Pfizer, and Procter and Gamble are all located in Kildare and continue to perform well.</p></reply>

In that context, since becoming Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have made regional development my top priority.  </p>  <p>  We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.</p>  <p>  For the State as a whole, since the launch of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs (RAPJ), over the period Q1 2015 to Q3 2018, there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment, with 163,500 of these located in the regions outside Co. Dublin &ndash; that is 3 out of every 5 jobs created.</p>  <p>  We remain committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 percent in each region by 2020 and to bring and/or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average. </p>  <p>  Latest CSO Labour Force Survey figures available at regional level show that the Mid East is performing very strongly and that the unemployment rate in the Region is currently at 5.8% as of Q3 2018, just below the State unemployment rate of 6.0%.  </p>  <p>  Since my Department's Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) initiative commenced, employment in the region has grown by 10.9% from Q1 2015 to Q3 2018. There are 32,200 more people in employment in the region from Q1 2015 to Q3 2018. </p>  <p>  In April 2018, I asked the RAPJ Implementation Committees, including in the Mid East, to refresh and refocus their Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020, especially in the face of current challenges, including Brexit. I expect to launch the new refreshed Regional Enterprise Plan for the Mid East in February.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland continues to work to contribute to employment and economic growth throughout all regions. Under its Build Scale, Expand Reach 2017 &ndash; 2020 Strategy the Agency aims to create 60,000 new jobs, while sustaining existing ones, which will make an important contribution to jobs and economic growth across all regions. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy places the regions at the core of economic growth in Ireland and is founded on four core objectives:</p>  <p>  - To maximise growth of Enterprise Ireland clients in the regions.</p>  <p>  - To strengthen Regional Infrastructure to maximise future growth of Irish Enterprise in the Regions</p>  <p>  - To support Entrepreneurship in the Regions</p>  <p>  - Work in collaboration to deliver Regional Growth</p>  <p>  As at December 2018, 8,923 people are now employed by Kildare companies supported by Enterprise Ireland. Employment in Enterprise Ireland supported companies in the county has grown by more than 3,900 or 78 percent over the past decade. </p>  <p>  The LEOs operating under the auspices of the Local Authorities and EI in every county, including Co. Kildare, continue to play a vital role in providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business. Companies supported by the LEOs in the Mid East (including Louth, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow) collectively employ over 3,700 (latest available data is for 2017) in 775 companies. LEO supported employment grew by a total of 480 (net) in the Mid East in the year to end 2017. In Co. Kildare, 171 LEO supported companies employ 967 people, up by a total of 128 in the year to end 2017.</p>  <p>  IDA meanwhile will continue to target a minimum increase in investment of 30% to 40% in each region outside Dublin under their Winning strategy to 2019. IDA supported companies in the Mid East region employ 13,088 people, an increase of 841 over 2017.</p>  <p>  There are 29 IDA supported client companies in County Kildare, which as of 2018, collectively employ 8,838 people - representing an increase of 4.5% over 2017. The County has a strong contingent of overseas firms in the Technology, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals sectors.  IDA clients such as Intel, Pfizer, and Procter and Gamble are all located in Kildare and continue to perform well.  </p>  <p>  I very much welcome INIT&rsquo;s  recent decision to locate their first operation outside of Germany in Kildare. In November 2018, the firm announced their plans to create a software development centre in Maynooth which will result in the creation of an additional 20 highly skilled jobs. This high-calibre investment reflects Kildare's significant potential and we will be working hard to attract further investment from overseas firms to the County.   </p>  <p>  My Department's &euro;60 million Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), administered by Enterprise Ireland, is aimed at accelerating economic recovery in all regions of the country by delivering on the potential of local and regional enterprise strengths. The Fund supports significant collaborative and innovative regional initiatives to build on specific industry sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability, thereby driving job creation.</p>  <p>  In early December last, under the second call of the REDF, I announced an allocation of just over &euro;29 million in funding to support 21 projects from all over the country. This is in addition to the over &euro;30 million in funding under Call 1 of the REDF that I announced in December 2017 that also funded 21 projects. Over the first and second calls under REDF, the Mid East Region secured funding of almost &euro;3.5 million across 2 projects.</p>  <p>  1. County Kildare Community Network Company: Mid-East Regional Innovation Think Space (MERITS) is a new build project to cluster Irish and international new-technology companies and provide mentorship and support, based in Naas County Kildare.</p>  <p>  2. Boyne Valley Food Innovation District (BVID): based in Navan, Co. Meath, BVID will deliver smart specialisation through an innovation-rich building and stimulus project for the Mid and North East regions which will empower food and drink entrepreneurs, escalate their growth and provide the economic, physical, and networking assets, aiming to create up to 250 new jobs, 50 new and expanding food businesses, 200 new/improved food and drink products, &euro;25m per annum in new export sales, 900 entrepreneurs and learners with increased competencies, and 60 interns delivering fresh talent and innovation.</p></reply>

In 2018, IDA Ireland commissioned a report by Grant Thornton which examined the impact of data centres on the Irish economy. In addition to an overall economic contribution of &euro;7.13bn since 2010, the report indicated that 85% of the data centres studied were already investing in power from renewable sources and 15% indicated that they were generating renewable energy onsite. Over 75% of data centre respondents were investing in two or more renewable energy initiatives, while over 60% were investing in energy efficient facilities and equipment.</p>  <p>  In addition, IDA Ireland has taken steps to help its data centre and other clients to mitigate their carbon footprint. For example, in 2018 the Agency introduced its &lsquo;Go Green&rsquo; Business Offer, which outlines the main national support programmes that are available to adopt green business principles, improve sustainability and drive energy efficiencies. These supports are provided by agencies including IDA Ireland, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The IDA's support programmes to reduce carbon emissions now include its Environmental Aid, Green Plus and Green Start programmes. These are being actively marketed across the Agency's client base, including to data centre operators. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-31a.65.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013100047#WRB01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 33, 39 and 44 together.</p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are working to provide extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I made Brexit one of my top priorities in the allocations of funding for 2019 in my Department and I have allocated further funding to Brexit-related support from agencies and offices of my Department as part of Budget 2019. I have allocated an additional &euro;5 million capital funding to the Local Enterprise Offices, an increase of 22% for 2019, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTrade Ireland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. I have allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland to expand their global footprints and drive the diversification of trade and investment. Additional resources have also been distributed across Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority and the NSAI for 2019 to support enterprises adjust to the new relationships with the UK and pursue new opportunities.</p>  <p>  Informed by detailed research, my Department has put in place a package of measures inresponse to the needs of businesses affected by Brexit-related uncertainty. </p>  <p>  I allocated an additional &euro;1million to InterTradeIreland (ITI) as part of Budget 2019. ITI works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. </p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. </p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms.  As of its most recent report and the end of November 2018, 811 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which 657 have been approved.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, 471 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.</p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities, as of 18 January 2018, 419 LEO clients were approved assistance under the grant. Also, additional capital funding of &euro;5 million was announced in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.</p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme. The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. </p>  <p>  In December 2018, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). </p>  <p>  In April 2017, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. This will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in all regions, and can be robust in addressing the challenges we face, including Brexit. As a result, both the North-West and the North-East will both have their own plans in the new iteration and Brexit will be an ongoing priority area for both Committees. These plans are being finalised and will be published in February. </p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 18th January, there have been 376 eligibility applications received of which 337 eligibility applications have been approved and 65 loans progressed to sanction at Bank level to a value of &euro;14.9m. </p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  The SBCI has issued an &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial institutions to apply by 11 February 2019 for designation as a lending partner under the Scheme. It is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p>  <p>  Over 3,900 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions, while 155 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 165 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 11 Brexit Advisory Clinics.</p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a new Customs Insights Online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. </p>  <p>  In order to help build the enterprise capability, under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) EI invested in seven successful projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million. This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. </p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. A &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; event was recently held in Monaghan in October and I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready event in Letterkenny in Donegal on 30 November 2018, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA.</p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario. </p></reply>

The agencies of the Department offer a range of supports to assist businesses to trade online.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop front line service assisting in delivering business growth and jobs for the small &amp;amp; micro-enterprise sector. The LEOs are the first port of call for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business, in terms of advice, training, sign posting to other support providers and, in certain circumstances, grant support. The LEOs undertake a number of activities to encourage businesses to build their online presence and compete in the online market place.</p>  <p>  The LEOs nationwide actively promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The TOVS offers matched financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, along with training and advice, to micro companies (10 or less employees) who want to establish an online presence for the first time, or who wish to expand a basic existing website to incorporate a more substantive online trading capacity. Since the start of the Scheme in July 2014 to date almost 4,500 micro companies have availed of the TOVS.</p>  <p>  The LEOs also offer a wide range of short training programmes to support their clients in building their online presence and to compete in the online marketplace. These programmes are focused on different elements which aim at maximising outputs from investment in online trading such as: </p>  <p>  - Marketing, focused mainly on development of an online/mobile marketing strategy;</p>  <p>  - Social Media, with the majority of programmes focused on educating the client base on how to use the different social media platforms to support their business;</p>  <p>  - eCommerce Sales Strategy, including how to convert website visits into sales; and</p>  <p>  - Search Engine Optimisation, including web analytics and video optimization for web.</p>  <p>  As Chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, I have prioritised supporting the retail sector to develop their online capability so as to expand their market reach nationally and internationally, and enhance their competitiveness. In 2017, data from the CSO showed that 66% of Irish enterprises in the Wholesale and Retail Sector reported having a website or homepage, with only 28% able to facilitate online ordering. </p>  <p>  In support of this, I have introduced a new pilot Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland, the first call of which opened on 24 October 2018 and closed on 5 December 2018. Applications are currently under assessment by Enterprise Ireland. The Online Retail Scheme will support retail businesses of 20 employees or more who are ready to strategically grow their online capability. Eligible expenditure under the Scheme includes activities such as research, strategy development, implementation and training. The Scheme launched with a fund of up to &euro;625,000, which was later doubled to &euro;1.25m as part of the Department&rsquo;s 2019 Budget. A second call will issue this year (2019).</p>  <p>  In recognition of the strong role the retail sector plays in supporting regional development and vibrant communities, at least 50% of the total number of grants awarded under the Scheme will be prioritised for retail SMEs with their headquarters outside of county Dublin, subject to applications meeting the minimum standards required.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) works with 5,000 manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, and building an online presence is part of the range of supports offered to those clients. EI has supported projects focused on developing innovative products on new product platforms for international markets. Working closely with the Irish Internet Association, EI delivers a range of funded and advisory eCommerce supports for its clients to develop their online marketing capabilities. In addition, EI regularly organises events which can connect clients with leading experts and inform them on best practice.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;1.8m has been earmarked for the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland over the next 3 years. The proposed investment, again via EI, is to assist the sector to develop and generate additional export sales and online revenue opportunities, increasing market diversification by client companies and underpinning sustainable growth.</p></reply>

The draft Omnibus Bill, the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill, focuses on measures protecting our citizens and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors.</p>  <p>  Insofar as my Department is concerned, Part 3 of the Omnibus Bill, consisting of nine heads, contains legislative provisions relevant to functions under my Department. The provisions in Part 3 contain provisions aimed at improving the range of supports offered by Enterprise Ireland to help companies face the challenges of Brexit. </p>  <p>  Specifically, the intention is to increase the ability of Enterprise Ireland to provide a competitive and flexible offering to its client companies in terms of R&amp;D grants and to allow EI to provide low interest debt instruments. </p>  <p>  In increasing powers for EI to provide lending supports to businesses, we are helping to preserve the value of the State&rsquo;s investments in these businesses and in assisting companies through restructuring or re-development programmes.</p>  <p>  Priority is currently being given by the Government and the Offices of the Attorney General and of Parliamentary Counsel to the urgent drafting and introduction of those legislative measures necessary to deal with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019. </p>  <p>  It is Government's firm intention to brief and regularly update the Opposition on the Brexit legislation as it develops. </p>  <p>  For my part, I stand ready to work with the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation in terms of any briefing update on Part 3 of the Omnibus legislation. I should point out that the draft heads of Part 3 of the Bill have been extracted from an existing Bill, the Industrial Development (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that is already on the Government's legislative programme. The Joint Committee has already considered this Bill in that guise and decided against the need for pre-legislative scrutiny of that Bill.</p>  <p>  With Government I am prepared to work closely with Opposition parties in the Oireachtas and all members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad in ensuring that the necessary no deal Brexit related legislation will be in place before the 29 March.</p></reply>

So, the Plans both complement and add value to what the Agencies are doing on the ground.</p><p>In relation to job creation, the 2020 targets initially set out under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (2015 &ndash; 2017) remain in place &ndash; that is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the aim of having the unemployment rate of each region within one percentage point of the State average. </p><p>I also want to ensure that the jobs that are being created are of good quality and sustainable in the longer term, in line with our Future Jobs Ireland objective. </p><p>In support of the Regional Plans, in December last, I announced a further twenty-one successful projects under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), bringing the total number of projects to 42 and a total allocation of &euro;60 million over two Calls. These collaborative job-creating initiatives aim to sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level, and are located in every region of Ireland. </p></reply>

I am focused on both supporting and sustaining existing employment levels in regional Ireland while also working to create new economic opportunities and jobs in every county of Ireland. I am pleased to say that total employment in IDA Ireland's client companies now stands at 229,057, with 58% of all IDA employment outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the organisation. The last 12 months have seen more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that County Meath has seen a 4% increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) employment in the last year. There are now 19 IDA-supported client companies in the County employing 1,632 people. These firms are continuing to grow and develop. Last year, for example, saw PCI Pharma announce that 50 new jobs will be created at their facility in Stamullen. This represented a vote of confidence in what Meath and the broader Mid-East region has to offer to multinationals who are looking to locate outside of Dublin. Meath continues, in particular, to maintain a strong contingent of overseas firms in the Financial Services, Manufacturing and Biotechnology sectors with key clients such as ArcRoyal, International Fund Services and Alltech performing well in the County. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland continues to draw the attention of investors considering locating or expanding to Meath and the broader Mid-East region.  This is reflected in IDA site visit statistics for the County. As of the third quarter of 2018, for example, Meath has hosted five site visits compared to three site visits in 2017. The IDA also owns lands in County Meath which are being actively marketed to its clients through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas. The Agency will keep the property situation in Meath under review to help ensure that companies can find the facilities or buildings they need in order to generate new jobs and investment.</p>  <p>  While progress has been made in helping to generate new economic opportunities in County Meath, the Government remains determined to achieve more. That is why work is continuing to unlock further the economic potential of the County. The IDA remains pivotal to this and the Agency is engaging with its clients and with other enterprise agencies to create jobs and source new investment there.</p></reply>

The framework regulates exports of Dual-use items. Dual-use items are goods and technology that can be used in both civil and military applications. The framework is given legal effect by Council Regulation (EC) No. 428/2009 setting up a Union regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items. This regulation has direct legal effect in all Member States of the EU. My Department is the national competent authority in Ireland with responsibility for the implementation of this regulation.</p>  <p>  Exports of Category 5 "Telecommunications and Information Security" dual-use items from Ireland are predominantly back-office IT systems e.g. data storage, networking, cybersecurity. They are classed as dual-use items by virtue of the fact that they incorporate strong encryption for data security purposes.</p>  <p>  Applications for export licences in respect of dual-use goods are subject to rigorous scrutiny by my officials and are assessed against the criteria set out in the Dual-use Regulation. There is a particular focus on the end-user within the country of destination. As part of their application, companies are required to submit a Certificate, signed by the end-user, stating the purpose for which the item to be exported will be used. My officials also consult an EU database to check if similar licence applications have been denied by another EU member state. </p>  <p>  My officials apply the criteria set out in Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP when assessing applications for Dual-use licences. Criterion 2 in particular, specifies consideration of "Respect for human rights in the country of final destination as well as respect by that country of international humanitarian law". </p>  <p>  My officials consult with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of export licence applications for sensitive destinations, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Israel, seeking observations on any foreign policy or human rights concerns that may arise in respect of a proposed export. Such considerations are subject to constant review in the light of developments in a particular regions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-31a.91.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013100047#WRB03900"><p>Since becoming Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have made jobs and enterprise in the regions my top priority. We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment across the State since Q1 2015 to Q3 2018, with 163,500 people in the regions outside of Co. Dublin entering employment in that period, that is over 63% - or 3 out of every 5 jobs created.</p>  <p>  To enhance the potential for enterprise development in the regions, and to add value to the core work of the enterprise agencies within the regions, I will shortly be launching nine new Regional Enterprise Plans which succeed the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) 2015-2017 initiative. The refresh and refocus of the RAPJs through these new Plans will ensure that through further collaborative initiatives we can enhance the attractiveness of regional locations for new investment and entrepreneurship and drive the creation of jobs of quality that are sustainable in the long term. The new Plans are also an essential element to strengthen the resilience of regions and regional enterprise in the face of new challenges, including Brexit.</p>  <p>  Strategic investments within the overarching national context, through Project Ireland 2040 are also key to ensuring each region can contribute to, and participate in Ireland&rsquo;s future national growth, and sustain a higher standard of living over the longer term.</p>  <p>  In relation to specific measures to attract more indigenous business to locate in regional areas, Enterprise Ireland provides advice and support to indigenous companies in every county, in urban and rural areas of Ireland, to start and scale, innovate and remain competitive on international markets, now and in the future. In addition, through the network of Local Enterprise Offices, Enterprise Ireland plays a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Corporate Strategy &ldquo;Build Scale Expand Reach 2017-2020&rdquo; places the regions at the core of economic growth in Ireland. The strategy sets ambitious targets to sustain 200,000 existing jobs and to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 and is founded on four core objectives:</p>  <p>  - To maximise growth of Enterprise Ireland clients in the regions.</p>  <p>  - To strengthen Regional Infrastructure to maximise future growth of Irish Enterprise in the Regions</p>  <p>  - To support Entrepreneurship in the Regions</p>  <p>  - Work in collaboration to deliver Regional Growth.</p>  <p>  In 2018 Enterprise Ireland supported companies employed 215,207 people. During that year, 18,846 new jobs were created resulting in a net gain of 9,119 jobs. Enterprise Ireland supported companies are estimated to sustain over 375,000 direct and indirect jobs nationwide. Of the new jobs supported by Enterprise Ireland in 2018, 61% were created outside of Dublin, and currently, 64% of all Enterprise Ireland supported employment is located outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is working with client companies through a network of market and sector advisers from nine offices located throughout the country. Enterprise Ireland engages with established client companies throughout the country via teams of sectoral focused development advisors using a company-led diagnostic approach which is used to establish clients&rsquo; business needs. Based on this, the agency can tailor a support package to a company&rsquo;s stage of growth and level of ambition. A support package focuses, where relevant, on six business pillars (Innovation, Finance, Operations, Sales and Marketing, People and Organisational Development). </p>  <p>  Ensuring that there is an ecosystem to support and sustain enterprises in regions is essential for regional enterprise development. To assist with balanced regional enterprise growth, Enterprise Ireland has, for example,</p>  <p>  - Invested &euro;60 million in 42 projects to support regions across the country to build capability in key sectors under the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund. All regions have been supported under this competitive fund.</p>  <p>  - Increased the number of accelerators operating in the Irish market to support entrepreneurship and job creation under the 2015 - 2017 Accelerator Development Scheme, including funding to 4 Regional Accelerators.</p>  <p>  - Up to January 2019, has supported 38 companies through the EI Competitive Start Fund (CSF) which is targeting a range of areas of focus, such as international entrepreneurs, graduates, fintech, agritech and female entrepreneurs.</p>  <p>  - Up to October 2018, supported 171 entrepreneurs on the New Frontiers programme which is EI&rsquo;s national entrepreneur development programme for innovative, early-stage start-ups, run in the 14 Institutes of Technology and two participating Universities across the country.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also supports client companies in regions around the country navigate the uncertainty of Brexit and has engaged in a programme of building resilience in Irish exporting companies focused on innovation, market diversification and competitiveness; and addressing the awareness and preparedness of companies to Brexit. </p>  <p>  As regards attracting Foreign Direct Investment, IDA Ireland's performance in 2018 resulted in the sixth consecutive year of strong growth under the Agency's current strategy. By the end of last year, total employment in the Agency's client companies stood at 229,057.</p>  <p>  Every region in Ireland has seen foreign direct investment (FDI) employment gains and there are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin. 56% of all net new FDI jobs created last year were based in regional locations.</p>  <p>  Since the beginning of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Winning&rsquo; Strategy, 407 Investments have been won for the regions and almost 27,000 net jobs have been added on the ground in locations outside Dublin. In addition, 58% of all IDA supported employment is now located outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the organisation. </p>  <p>  The year 2018 saw more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years. There have been a number of positive FDI announcements in regional locations during 2018 such as:</p>  <p>  - 600 jobs at Edwards Lifesciences in Limerick (March).</p>  <p>  - 400 jobs at Wuxi, Dundalk and an investment &euro;325m (April).</p>  <p>  - 500 jobs at Abbott in Donegal (July)</p>  <p>  - 200 jobs at Leetha Industries, Longford (May).</p>  <p>  - 150 jobs at Jaguar LandRover, Shannon (January).</p>  <p>  - 150 jobs at Phibro Health, Sligo (July).</p>  <p>  Attracting FDI to regional areas is not without its challenges. That is largely because there is a global trend to base FDI around large urban areas where there is, for example, ready access to transport hubs and networks. Companies may also want to be located near competitors or clusters of other similar enterprises. </p>  <p>  The IDA's Regional Property Programme (RPP) remains an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to locate in areas outside of Dublin.  Budget 2019 saw the Agency allocated an additional &euro;10m for the RPP on top of the &euro;150 m for the RPP launched in 2015. This will help ensure that property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding, thereby encouraging more FDI to the regions. The IDA plans to develop new buildings in regional locations including Carlow, Dundalk, Monaghan, Sligo, Athlone, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. </p></reply>

This represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the organisation. The last 12 months have seen more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years.  </p>  <p>  As regards Carlow, IDA Ireland-supported employment there has increased by 31% in the last year, with 275 net new foreign direct investment-supported jobs added in the County. Between 2011 and 2018 the total of IDA supported jobs in Carlow grew from 514 to 1,150, representing a twofold increase in total employment.  </p>  <p>  Looking ahead, there are positive indications that Carlow will continue to see foreign direct investment-driven job growth. Last October's announcement by Merck, Sharp and Dohme - where it set out plans to construct a second manufacturing facility in Carlow and expand its workforce there with the creation of 170 new jobs - reflects the potential of the area and its capacity to attract first-class investment. The IDA will continue to work with its clients to identify further such opportunities for new investment or expansion in Carlow and the South-East region generally. In doing so, the Agency will draw the attention of investors to the region's particular strengths. These include the South-East's accessibility, its ports and its existing cluster of medical technology firms. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, under the IDA's regional property programme, an Advanced Technology Building (ATB) in Carlow will soon be constructed, with work expected to begin in 2019 following completion of a site acquisition. This ATB, by providing a top-class property solution to an overseas firm, should help to attract further investment to the County. </p>  <p>  While progress has been made in helping to generate new economic opportunities in Carlow, the Government remains determined to achieve more. That is why work is continuing to unlock further the economic potential of the County. The IDA remains central to this and the Agency's staff will be doing all they can to create new jobs and source further investment for Carlow and the South-East.</p></reply>

While initially the protests were against the worsening economic situation, they quickly developed into calls for President Omar al-Bashir&rsquo;s resignation.</p>  <p>  President Omar al-Bashir reacted by closing schools and declaring a state of emergency in some regions.  Sudanese police have used tear gas and live ammunition in an attempt to disperse crowds.  It is reported that almost 1,000 people have been arrested across the country since protests began. The Sudanese Government has said that 30 people have been killed during demonstrations, while Sudanese activists and medical workers say that the number killed is at least 45.  The use of live fire and arbitrary detention cannot be justified.</p>  <p>  Ireland fully supports the EU's 24 December 2018 call on the Government of Sudan to exercise restraint, respect the right to peaceful protest and ensure that all law enforcement and security bodies act under its direct control and in accordance with Sudan's constitutional and international commitments.  Ireland also stands fully behind the EU statement of 11 January 2019 which calls on the Government of Sudan to release all journalists, members of the opposition, human rights defenders and other protesters arbitrarily detained, and to guarantee the independence of the Investigation Committee tasked with the investigation of abuses.  The Embassy of Ireland in Nairobi, which is accredited to Sudan, continues to monitor the situation closely in cooperation with the Delegation of the European Union in Khartoum.</p>  <p>  In addition to the current unrest, Sudan continues to suffer from a range of humanitarian crises, driven by protracted conflicts, inequality and climate change.  These feed into the popular disaffection leading to protests. This humanitarian situation has been further exacerbated by the economic crisis in 2018, leading to severe levels of food insecurity and malnutrition across the country. More than 1.8 million people are internally displaced and Sudan hosts a further 1.2 million refugees that have fled conflict in neighbouring countries, the majority of whom rely on humanitarian aid for their survival. As a result, an estimated 5.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year, including 2.6 million children.  Ireland is responding to these crises, with almost &euro;26 million in direct humanitarian assistance to Sudan through our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners since 2012. </p></reply>

However, a Revenue Commissioners concession allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain types of vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  Revenue has since decided to remove this concession with effect from 1 March 2019 so that all food supplements will be charged at the standard VAT rate. </p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that human oral medicines, including certain folic acid and other vitamin and mineral products, licenced by the Health Products Regulatory Association will continue to apply at the zero rate of VAT.  Infant foods and food products such as yoghurts that contain probiotic ingredients will also continue to be zero rated.  </p>  <p>  The operation of the concession became extremely problematic as a result of efforts by certain businesses in the industry to extend the concession beyond the scope permitted. Consistent challenges to Revenue guidance and decisions on the VAT rating of products gave rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p>  <p>  However, independent of Revenue&rsquo;s decisions on interpretation, I agreed during the recent Finance Bill to put in place a process that will conclude in the 2019 Tax Strategy Group Paper to examine some of the policy choices around the VAT treatment of food supplements. The Tax Strategy group paper will be published, in line with previous years, in the summer of this year.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular types of insurance.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the availability and cost of insurance.  What was recognised with the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) was that the environment within which insurers conduct their business can be better shaped, in order to make the Irish insurance market a more competitive one and also make it more attractive for new entrants.  Building upon the work undertaken in the completion of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, the second phase of the CIWG culminated in the publication of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in January 2018.</p>  <p>  This Report makes 15 recommendations with 29 associated actions to be carried out, set out in an Action Plan with agreed timelines for implementation.  </p>  <p>  The recommendations, covering three main themes, include actions to:</p>  <p>  - Increase Transparency:  enhance levels of transparency and improve data sharing and collection processes,</p>  <p>  - Review the level of damages in personal injury cases: request that the Law Reform Commission undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, and</p>  <p>  - Improve the personal injuries litigation framework: through a number of measures, namely:</p>  <p>  a. ensuring potential defendants are notified in sufficient time that an incident has occurred in relation to which a claim is going to be made against their policy;</p>  <p>  b. tackling fraudulent or exaggerated claims; and</p>  <p>  c. ensuring suitable training and information supports are available to the judiciary to assist in the fair and consistent assessment and awarding of damages in personal injury cases.</p>  <p>  There is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare updates on its progress.  The most recent such update was published in November 2018 and shows that of the 19 actions from the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance with deadlines up to and including Q3 2018, 18 have been completed.  It is envisaged that the next Progress Update will be completed by the end of February. Both of the primary Reports and all of the quarterly updates are available on the Department&rsquo;s website, within &ldquo;The Cost of Insurance Working Group&rdquo; sub-section of the main &ldquo;Insurance&rdquo; section.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the CIWG will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Motor Report.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.</p></reply>

The scheme, the Living City Initiative, was extended by Finance Act 2016 to allow capital allowances to be claimed by lessors of residential property on conversion or refurbishment expenditure incurred on property situated in a special regeneration area. The areas coming within the scheme are designated areas within the cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Kilkenny. Expenditure must be incurred in the qualifying period which at present runs from 1 January 2017 to 4 May 2020. The main features of the scheme are as follows:</p>  <p>  - The property being converted or refurbished must have been built prior to 1915,</p>  <p>  - The property must be located within a special regeneration area,</p>  <p>  - Expenditure of at least &euro;5,000 must be incurred,</p>  <p>  - A letter of certification must be obtained from the relevant local authority, and</p>  <p>  - After refurbishment/conversion the property must be let on bona fide commercial terms.</p>  <p>  Further information on the scheme is available on the Revenue website www.revenue.ie.</p>  <p>  Under the VAT Consolidation Act, VAT recovery is available on costs that are incurred in connection with a taxable supply. The sale of residential property by the person who developed it in the course of a property development business (i.e. a property developer who developed the property for sale) is always subject to VAT and a person engaged in such development activity is entitled to recover the VAT on construction costs.</p>  <p>  In contrast, the letting of residential property is exempt from VAT. Where a person incurs VAT on construction costs of a residential property developed for letting and lets that property upon completion, the person is not entitled to recover the VAT on construction costs nor will they be liable for VAT on the rental income. Under the VAT Directive, there are no provisions that would permit VAT recovery in these circumstances, nor is there provision for VAT deductibility for persons that are not registered for VAT. </p></reply>

It is too early to draw any conclusions on the impact of these increases. </p>  <p>  Receipts from betting duty represented less than 1 per cent of all excise receipts in 2017 and this is also likely to be the case in for 2018. In addition, unlike other excisable commodities, there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. I have outlined why I consider the betting sector needs to make a fair contribution to the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  In any discussion on betting duty, we must acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers. I have outlined my view that this needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.   </p>  <p>  During the course of the Finance Bill process I agreed to review an alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector following the announcement of increases in betting duty in Budget 2019, and I acknowledge that small independent bookmakers may have difficulty competing with larger bookmakers with retail and/or online operations. My officials are currently considering this proposal, including the compatibility of a core element with EU rules, and will set out analysis and options in relation to betting duty at the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) meeting in July. The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly afterwards. </p></reply>

Neither my Department nor the Central Bank of Ireland collect the type of information being sought by the Deputy on a routine basis.  However, the Deputy will note that in line with Recommendation 12 of the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance, my Department has published Key Information Reports relating to Motor Insurance.  In advance of the establishment of the National Claims Information Database, these reports endeavour to provide some information on key aggregated metrics in relation to motor insurance and may contain some information relevant to the Deputy&rsquo;s request.  The most recent of these reports was published in May 2018 and provides some information and data on claims costs trends, including third party injury costs and non-injury in Parts 2 to 4, between 2011 and 2016 &ndash; see attached link: .</p><p>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Oireachtas recently passed the legislation to provide relevant powers to the Central Bank of Ireland to establish the National Claims Information Database. The Deputy may like to note that the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 was commenced by the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 (Commencement) Order 2019 (S.I. 2 of 2019) on Monday 28 January 2019.  The Central Bank plans to collect claims data for the National Claims Information Database from insurance undertakings in the first half of 2019, with a view to publishing its first annual report under the legislation in the second half of this year.</p><p>With regard to the type of data requested by the Deputy, it is expected that the Central Bank will collect and publish claims information in respect of the last 10 years, including the number of claims reported and settled, the amounts paid on claims, the incurred cost on claims (i.e. the amount paid plus the outstanding amount to be paid, if any), and the actuarial estimate of the final cost of claims i.e. ultimate costs.  This data will be submitted for each type of claim, i.e. Third Party Injury, Third Party Damage, Accidental/Own Damage, Fire &amp;amp; Theft, and Windscreen.  This historic data will enable trends in average cost per claim, average claims cost per type of policy, and claims frequency to be analysed by both type of claim and type of policy.  </p></reply>

This was the biggest change to the PAYE system since the 1960s.  All employers are now required to report employees pay and deductions to Revenue as they are being paid. All employees paid by this Department are paid on a fortnightly basis and a return is submitted to Revenue prior to the payments for each fortnightly being issued.</p>  <p>  The first payroll of 2019 paid by the Department was on the 3rd January 2019 for post primary teachers and substitute teachers and on 10 January for primary, non-teaching staff and retirees.</p>  <p>  Schools input records of employment through the On Line Claims System for substitute teachers (casual /non casual staff) and the details of each period of employment transfers to the Department where the appropriate rates of pay are applied, statutory deductions are calculated and the payment issues in the regular payroll run for the sector.</p>  <p>  In the first payrolls of the New Year and the second payroll for post primary issued on the 17th January, the payroll files that transferred to Revenue inadvertently included an end date for substitute (casual /non casual) staff which informed Revenue that these staff would not be paid under this employer number in the future.  This notification incorrectly ceased the affected staff and notified Revenue of same.  When Revenue is notified by an employer that an employment has ceased, the credits at that employment are available for reallocation to an existing employment or to a new employment. </p>  <p>  The payroll software has been amended to prevent an end date transferring to Revenue for future payments which means substitute teachers (casual /non casual staff) coming on future payrolls will not have problems with tax credits.  However this did not correct the issues that arose for the staff who were paid already.</p>  <p>  The priority within the Department is to address the problems that have already arisen for staff to ensure that the correct tax credits apply and that refunds of tax that have been deducted in error will issue to the staff concerned.  The Department is devoting all available technical resources to resolve the problem as a matter of urgency for those who were impacted and is liaising with Revenue on an ongoing basis.  </p></reply>

As previously set out, there is no application process for DEIS as all schools at both Primary and Post Primary are assessed using the new identification model.</p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process uses data from a number of sources to improve accuracy regarding the socio-demographic profile of schools resulting from the new identification model. This will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p>  <p>  The current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.

A template anti-bullying policy which must be used by all schools for this purpose is included in the procedures. </p>  <p>  The procedures for schools outline key principles of best practice for both preventing and tackling bullying and require all schools to commit to these principles in their anti-bullying policy. In particular, they emphasise that a cornerstone in the prevention of bullying is a positive school culture and climate. In that regard, the procedures set out the need for schools to encourage and strengthen open dialogue between all school staff and pupils and to ensure that they provide appropriate opportunities for pupils to raise their concerns in an environment that is comfortable for the pupil. Under the procedures, the Board of Management must also ensure that the school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy is regularly highlighted and promoted on a school wide basis with particular attention given to incoming pupils and their parents.</p>  <p>  The Board of Management must ensure that the school has clear procedures for the formal noting and reporting of bullying behaviour and these must be documented in the schools&rsquo; anti-bullying policy. A pupil or parent may bring a bullying concern to any teacher in the school.  Individual teachers must take appropriate measures regarding reports of bullying behaviour in accordance with the school&rsquo;s anti-bullying policy.  </p>  <p>  It is not a requirement that a teacher must witness an act of bullying before the school can determine bullying to have occurred. In the procedures the member of teaching staff who has responsibility for investigating and dealing with bullying is referred to as the &ldquo;relevant teacher&rdquo;. If it is established by the relevant teacher that bullying has occurred, the relevant teacher must keep appropriate written records which will assist his or her efforts to resolve the issues.  All reports including anonymous reports of bullying must be investigated and dealt with by the relevant teacher. Non-teaching staff such as secretaries, special needs assistants (SNAs), bus escorts, caretakers and cleaners must be encouraged to report any incidents of bullying behaviour witnessed by them, or mentioned to them, to the relevant teacher. </p>  <p>  The procedures include important new oversight arrangements that involve the school principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti - bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the Parents' Association and published on the school website. In addition, my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, as part of its inspection work, is placing a stronger focus on the actions schools take to create a positive school culture and to prevent and tackle bullying.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</font></p><p><font color="#00201F">Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it recognises that every community, either urban or rural, has its own concerns and expectations. The role of a community Garda is not a specialist role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; rather it is the case that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. The official categorisation of Community Garda simply refers to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others. It is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs. </font></p><p><font color="#00201F">I have been informed by the Commissioner that a new &ldquo;Community Policing Framework&rdquo; is currently at an advanced stage. I understand that under this new Framework which will take into account the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, it is envisaged that Community policing may be a specialism in some urban areas. In rural areas, it may be more of a hybrid model where all Garda&iacute; in a District have a community responsibility but also having to attend normal policing duties.</font></p><p><font color="#00201F">Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. This accelerated recruitment of Garda&iacute; saw Garda numbers reach just over 14,000 by the end of 2018. Furthermore, a total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019, an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation. This substantial investment will provide new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in carrying out their work and increasing visibility in both rural and urban communities </font></p><p><font color="#00201F">The Garda Commissioner has informed me that it is his intention to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; in 2019 along with a net 600 Garda Staff (civilians).  The recruitment of these additional Garda staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy this year a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to the frontline duties for which they are trained. I believe that the injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, along with the new recruits, will be really beneficial in terms of protecting communities. This and on-going recruitment will clearly provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across the organisation, including Community Policing in the coming years. </font></p><p><font color="#00201F">The information in relation to the number of Community Garda&iacute; by Division in each of the years 2008 as to 30 December 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the following link.</font></p><p>  </p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see the following link: </p></reply>

This report contained a number of recommendations to improve the criminal justice and regulatory response to harm perpetrated online. The report is essentially divided into two parts:</p>  <p>  It proposed the appointment of a Digital Safety Commissioner to promote digital safety, to publish a statutory Code of Practice on it and to oversee efficient take-down procedures to ensure that harmful communications can be removed as quickly as possible from social media sites. The proposed legislation in relation to the appointment of a Digital Safety Commissioner is being dealt with by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  It also proposed significant reform in the area of the criminal law and it was intended that my Department would bring forward legislation to give effect to the criminal law aspects of the report. However, due to competing legislative priorities, progress was not as rapid as I had hoped. In 2017, Deputy Brendan Howlin introduced a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017 to the D&aacute;il. It completed second stage in January 2018 and was not opposed by Government. Cabinet approval was recently given to discontinue work on the Government Bill and to support Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Bill to ensure that legislation can be enacted as swiftly as possible. The main provisions of the Bill as published include:</p>  <p>  - The existing offence of sending false, threatening, indecent or obscene messages will be extended. At present, it applies to communication by telephone or sms messaging but the new offence proposed will apply to all threatening, false, indecent and obscene messages sent persistently using any form of online or traditional method of communications. </p>  <p>  - Two new offences relating to non-consensual distribution of intimate images with/without intent to cause harm or distress (generally referred to as &ldquo;revenge pornography&rdquo;). Whether the person against whom the offence was committed is underage or unable to guard themselves from harm is intended to be an aggravating factor to be considered in sentencing for the offence of non-consensual distribution of an image. </p>  <p>  - The existing offence of harassment as contained in section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 will be extended to include all forms of communication, including through online or digital communications and will include communication to, or about a person.  </p>  <p>  - A new stalking offence. </p>  <p>  Department officials have been working with Deputy Howlin with the intention of identifying and bringing forward any necessary Government amendments to ensure the Bill can be as robust and effective as possible.  </p>  <p>  Legislative reform is one of the actions under the Action Plan for Online Safety 2018-2019, which was launched by the Taoiseach in July last year and is currently being implemented. The Action Plan involves a wide range of actions, across six Government Departments - Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health and Business Enterprise and Innovation, recognising that online safety is not the responsibility of any one Department and signifying the range and breadth of the issues involved.</p>  <p>  In light of the ongoing work in this Department and other Departments to tackle issues relating to online safety, I currently have no plans to review Part 11 or Part 13 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to extend anti-social behaviour orders to social media usage.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-31a.307.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013100050#WRE05900"><p>As Minister, my objective is to create the best possible environment for enterprise, entrepreneurship, innovation and investment. Creating more jobs outside of our main cities is a key priority for both the IDA and my Department in that regard. Real progress has already been made towards that goal, with 58% of all IDA employment now outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the organisation. The last 12 months has also seen more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years. </p>  <p>  With regard to site visits, they do remain an important tool in helping showcase particular locations to potential overseas investors. In 2017, Wexford hosted three such visits by IDA client firms. There were three further site visits to the County in the first three quarters of 2018. Data on site visits for the entirety of 2018, for both Wexford and the remainder of the country, will be available shortly. </p>  <p>  The IDA has a number of locations available for investment in Wexford which are being actively marketed to its clients through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas. These include lands at the IDA Business &amp;amp; Technology Park in Wexford Town, the Whitemill Industrial Estate in Wexford Town and the IDA Business Park in Enniscorthy. I am hopeful that further investors can be encouraged to situate in the County, whether at these sites or others, and thereby contribute further to the wider region's growth and development. </p>  <p>  Whilst the IDA is doing everything within its power to ensure its clients locate outside the country&rsquo;s principal urban areas, attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to the regions is not without its challenges. Many overseas firms, for example, will only consider large cities for a variety of operational and commercial reasons.</p>  <p>  I am nevertheless pleased to say that FDI in County Wexford has exhibited strong growth in recent years. I understand that there are 18 IDA client companies now located there, employing a total of 3,139 people. There has been a 6.5% increase in IDA supported employment in the County from 2017 to 2018. Moreover, Wexford has seen a 25% increase in FDI-driven employment since 2013. It should also be noted that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin.</p>  <p>  While the employment trends in Wexford are positive, I recognise that there is room for improvement in the County. I am working hard, together with my colleagues across Government, to further unlock its economic potential and thereby create more jobs and opportunities for the people of the area.</p></reply>

These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign, including a recent event held in Monaghan in October where I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies also participated in the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready event in Letterkenny in Donegal on Friday 30 November last, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA. Last week, the Revenue Commissioners held a seminar in Dundalk. The seminar focused on customs requirements, procedures and operation of the UK landbridge and transit arrangements. This week the NSAI is hosting Brexit events in Cavan, Monaghan and Sligo and further events are in planning by my Department and agencies.   </p>  <p>  Informed by detailed research, my Department has put in place a package of measures in response to the needs of businesses affected by Brexit-related uncertainty. </p>  <p>  I allocated an additional &euro;1million to InterTradeIreland (ITI) as part of Budget 2019. ITI works with SMEs on an all-Ireland basis and is particularly well-placed, given its remit to develop cross-border trade, to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. </p>  <p>  The ITI Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of the service, ITI has organised a series of awareness events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. To date, more than 4,000 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. </p>  <p>  ITI also offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher scheme, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. ITI vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Companies are finding the vouchers very useful and there has been strong demand which can be attributed to the media campaign conducted by ITI across a range of platforms.  </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs continue to organize various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. In addition, 471 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit.</p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help companies prepare for Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities, as of 18 January 2018, 419 LEO clients were approved assistance under the grant. Also, i have provided additional capital funding of &euro;5 million in Budget 2019 for local enterprise development.</p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme. The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. </p>  <p>  In December 2018, I announced a further &euro;30 million in funding for successful projects under Call 2 of the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). </p>  <p>  In April 2017, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. This will ensure that the Plans remain effective and that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in all regions, and can be robust in addressing the challenges we face, including Brexit. As a result, both the North-West and the North-East will both have their own plans in the new iteration and Brexit will be an ongoing priority area for both Committees. These plans are being finalised and will be published in February. </p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short term working capital, 1-3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties.  Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 18th January, there have been 376 eligibility applications received of which 337 eligibility applications have been approved and 65 loans progressed to sanction at Bank level to a value of &euro;14.9m. </p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Loans of &euro;50,000 to &euro;3m will be available, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis. The scheme will be available to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  The SBCI has issued an &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial institutions to apply by 11 February 2019 for designation as a lending partner under the Scheme. It is expected that this Scheme will be operational in early 2019.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p>  <p>  Over 3,900 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions, while 155 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 165 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 11 Brexit Advisory Clinics.</p>  <p>  EI also recently launched a new Customs Insights Online course which is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. </p>  <p>  In order to help build the enterprise capability, under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) EI invested in seven successful projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million. This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. </p>  <p>  My Department and I have been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. A &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; event was recently held in Monaghan in October and I was delighted to welcome many businesses from the Border Region. Officials from my Department and agencies participated in all six Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events in 2018, which included Enterprise Ireland, IDA, the LEOs, NSAI and the HSA. </p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, not everyone is engaging. With Brexit around the corner, I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help. My Department and its agencies are providing extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario. </p></reply>

The growth forecast had already been revised downwards (partly because of the negative effects of tariff increases enacted by the United State and China). The further downward revision in part reflects carry over from softer momentum in the second half of 2018 &ndash; including in Germany following the introduction of new automobile fuel emission standards and in Italy where concerns about sovereign and financial risks have weighed on domestic demand.</p>  <p>  The IMF also note that the risks to global growth tilt to the downside. An escalation of trade tensions beyond those already incorporated in the forecast remains a key source of risk to the outlook. A range of triggers beyond escalating trade tensions &ndash; including a no deal Brexit, and a greater-than-envisaged slowdown in China - could spark a further deterioration in risk sentiment with adverse growth implications, especially given the high levels of public and private debt.</p>  <p>  Increasing productivity is the only long-term sustainable way of increasing the standard of living for our people, and there are a range of initiatives in train across Government to enhance our competitiveness performance, including:</p>  <p>  The review of SME policy designed to assess the SME business ecosystem and the range of supports offered to SMEs undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the OECD;</p>  <p>  The development of an Industry 4.0 strategy to respond to the challenges and opportunities arising from the impact of digital technologies; and</p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme that will allow businesses to borrow for up to 10 years to support capital investment and enhance their competitiveness.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of the Taoiseach are also preparing the Future Jobs Programme, a cross-government initiative with a strong focus on improving productivity, that will be published in February. This initiative will propose concrete and ambitious actions to enhance our productivity and competitiveness and will ensure that we are well positioned to adapt to transformational changes the economy will face in the years ahead. </p></reply>

The County has a strong contingent of overseas firms in the Technology, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals sectors.  IDA clients such as Intel, Pfizer, and Procter and Gamble are all located in Kildare and continue to perform well.  </p>  <p>  The IDA's efforts to increase FDI in Kildare is strengthened by the presence of NUI Maynooth in the County. The University has been involved in a number of research projects with IDA client companies and has seven research institutes on campus. These include the Hamilton Institute - a world leading research unit in ICT with a focus on drones, AI and robotics - and the Innovation Value Institute which has been co-developed with Intel.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome INIT&rsquo;s recent decision to locate their first operation outside of Germany in Kildare. In November 2018, the firm announced their plans to create a software development centre in Maynooth which will result in the creation of an additional 20 highly skilled jobs. This high-calibre investment reflects Kildare's significant potential and we will be working hard to attract further investment from overseas firms to the County.   </p>  <p>  In addition, in 2018 Science Foundation Ireland approved grants of &euro;3,716,400 in NUI Maynooth across a number of initiatives including the President of Ireland Future Research Leaders Programme and the Research Infrastructure Programme.</p></reply>

We want to have a situation where all regions are enabled to realise their potential as contributors to economic recovery and growth, and thereby reduce regional disparities.</p>  <p>  Since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) there has been an increase of 258,800 people in employment across the State since Q1 2015 to Q3 2018, with 163,500 people in the regions outside of Co. Dublin entering employment in that period, that is over 63% - or 3 out of every 5 jobs created.</p>  <p>  To enhance the potential for enterprise development in the regions, and to add value to the core work of the enterprise agencies within the regions, I will shortly be launching nine new Regional Enterprise Plans which succeed the Regional Action Plan for Jobs (RAPJ) 2015-2017 initiative. The refresh and refocus of the RAPJs through these new Plans will ensure that through further collaborative initiatives we can enhance the attractiveness of regional locations for new investment and entrepreneurship and drive the creation of jobs of quality that are sustainable in the long term. The new Plans are also an essential element to strengthen the resilience of regions and regional enterprise in the face of new challenges, including Brexit.</p>  <p>  Strategic investments within the overarching national context, through Project Ireland 2040 are also key to ensuring each region can contribute to, and participate in Ireland&rsquo;s future national growth, and sustain a higher standard of living over the longer term.</p>  <p>  In relation to specific measures to encourage and foster job opportunities throughout the regions, Enterprise Ireland provides advice and support to indigenous companies in every county, in urban and rural areas of Ireland, to start and scale, innovate and remain competitive on international markets, now and in the future. In addition, through the network of Local Enterprise Offices in every county in Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, in partnership with the Local Authorities, plays a critical role in driving and nurturing entrepreneurship all the way from an originating idea at local level, to taking-on global markets. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Corporate Strategy &ldquo;Build Scale Expand Reach 2017-2020&rdquo; places the regions at the core of economic growth in Ireland. The strategy sets ambitious targets to sustain 200,000 existing jobs and to create 60,000 new jobs by 2020 and is founded on four core objectives:</p>  <p>  - To maximise growth of Enterprise Ireland clients in the regions.</p>  <p>  - To strengthen Regional Infrastructure to maximise future growth of Irish Enterprise in the Regions</p>  <p>  - To support Entrepreneurship in the Regions</p>  <p>  - Work in collaboration to deliver Regional Growth</p>  <p>  In 2018 Enterprise Ireland supported companies employed 215,207 people. During that year, 18,846 new jobs were created resulting in a net gain of 9,119 jobs. Enterprise Ireland supported companies are estimated to sustain over 375,000 direct and indirect jobs nationwide. Of the new jobs supported by Enterprise Ireland in 2018, 61% were created outside of Dublin, and currently, 64% of all Enterprise Ireland supported employment is located outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is working with client companies through a network of market and sector advisers from nine offices located throughout the country. Enterprise Ireland engages with established client companies throughout the country via teams of sectoral focused development advisors using a company-led diagnostic approach which is used to establish clients&rsquo; business needs. Based on this, the agency can tailor a support package to a company&rsquo;s stage of growth and level of ambition. A support package focuses, where relevant, on six business pillars (Innovation, Finance, Operations, Sales and Marketing, People and Organisational Development). </p>  <p>  Ensuring that there is an ecosystem to support and sustain enterprises in regions is essential for regional enterprise development and job creation. To assist with balanced regional enterprise growth, Enterprise Ireland initiatives include, for example,</p>  <p>  - Investing &euro;60 million in 42 projects to support regions across the country to build capability in key sectors under the competitive Regional Enterprise Development Fund. All regions are being supported under this competitive fund.</p>  <p>  - Increased the number of accelerators operating in the Irish market to support entrepreneurship and job creation under the 2015 - 2017 Accelerator Development Scheme, including funding to 4 Regional Accelerators.</p>  <p>  - Up to January 2019, EI has supported 38 companies through the EI Competitive Start Fund (CSF) which is targeting a range of areas of focus, such as international entrepreneurs, graduates, fintech, agritech and female entrepreneurs.</p>  <p>  - Up to October 2018, EI supported 171 entrepreneurs on the New Frontiers programme which is EI&rsquo;s national entrepreneur development programme for innovative, early-stage start-ups, run in the 14 Institutes of Technology and two participating Universities across the country.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also supports client companies in regions around the country navigate the uncertainty of Brexit and has engaged in a programme of building resilience in Irish exporting companies focused on innovation, market diversification and competitiveness; and addressing the awareness and preparedness of companies to Brexit. </p>  <p>  As regards attracting Foreign Direct Investment, IDA Ireland's performance in 2018 resulted in the sixth consecutive year of strong growth under the Agency's current strategy. By the end of last year, total employment in the Agency's client companies stood at 229,057.</p>  <p>  Every region in Ireland has seen foreign direct investment (FDI) employment gains and there are now over 132,000 people employed across 681 firms in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin. 56% of all net new FDI jobs created last year were based in regional locations.</p>  <p>  Since the beginning of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;Winning&rsquo; Strategy, 407 Investments have been won for the regions and almost 27,000 net jobs have been added on the ground in locations outside Dublin. In addition, 58% of all IDA supported employment is now located outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the organisation. </p>  <p>  The year 2018 saw more IDA jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years. There have been a number of positive FDI announcements in regional locations during 2018 such as:</p>  <p>  - 600 jobs at Edwards Lifesciences in Limerick (March).</p>  <p>  - 400 jobs at Wuxi, Dundalk and an investment &euro;325m (April).</p>  <p>  - 500 jobs at Abbott in Donegal (July)</p>  <p>  - 200 jobs at Leetha Industries, Longford (May).</p>  <p>  - 150 jobs at Jaguar LandRover, Shannon (January).</p>  <p>  - 150 jobs at Phibro Health, Sligo (July).</p>  <p>  Attracting to FDI to regional areas is not without its challenges. That&rsquo;s largely because there is a global trend to base FDI around large urban areas where there is, for example, ready access to transport hubs and networks. Companies may also want to be located near competitors or clusters of other similar enterprises. </p>  <p>  The IDA's Regional Property Programme (RPP) remains an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to locate in areas outside of Dublin.  Budget 2019 saw the Agency allocated an additional &euro;10m for the RPP on top of the &euro;150 m for the RPP launched in 2015. This will help ensure that property solutions are in place for overseas companies considering investing or expanding, thereby encouraging more FDI to the regions. The IDA plans to develop new buildings in regional locations including Carlow, Dundalk, Monaghan, Sligo, Athlone, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. </p></reply>

The agencies under my Department have a wide range of supports available to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK, and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus is to assist client companies to build on the strength of their 2018 performance by supporting them to start, innovate, be competitive and to diversify their global footprint. In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined, a Global Ambition campaign launched and an intensive programme initiated to support companies to take action and plan for Brexit so that they have the resilience necessary to navigate the challenges and opportunities posed by any kind of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Agency has assisted client companies to increase their exports to a record &euro;22.71 billion in 2017, a growth of 7% compared to 2016&rsquo;s exporting results. The UK market accounted for 34% of total exports, an increase of 4% on 2016 exporting figures.</p>  <p>  The UK is the leading exporting destination for Enterprise Ireland supported companies and is the first export destination for many companies. Despite this, Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food companies, are increasingly diversifying their global footprint beyond the UK. The proportion of exports to the UK has reduced by 10% over the last ten years, reflecting the success Irish companies are having in substantially increasing and broadening their exports to other international markets.</p>  <p>  While Brexit presents an economy wide challenge, a number of exporting sectors are highly exposed to Brexit. In 2017, 1,574 client companies reported exports into the UK. Of this, a group of over 640 are highly exposed to Brexit and predominately span 6 sectors (construction services, construction products, engineering, agriculture machinery, timber, furniture and food). Enterprise Ireland is working intensively with this group to ensure that sustainability and growth plans are developed in line with the agency&rsquo;s remit.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has a broad range of supports to help companies prepare for Brexit including the Brexit Scorecard, Be Prepared Grant, Advisory Clinics, Agile Innovation Fund, Operational Excellence Offer and Market Discovery Fund. Recently launched EI supports including online Customs Training and Act On Consultancy.  Later in February, it is planned that the Local Enterprise Offices will be launching their customs training offering which will be available to all companies.  Furthermore, the suite of enterprise supports in place cover a range of potential Brexit impacts.  These range from liquidity support through short term and longer term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties, including an EU State aid approved Rescue and Restructure Schemes in place to deal with sudden shocks and an expanded network of overseas offices and in-market supports to help firms diversify markets and to consolidate market share in the UK where appropriate.</p>  <p>  While many businesses have taken preparedness actions, a number have yet to do so. It is vital that businesses prepare themselves for Brexit impacts and take actions to mitigate. Firms that do business with the UK, whether buying goods or exporting products, should examine their supply chains to determine their vulnerabilities and take appropriate action.</p></reply>

The Department is engaging and listening to the needs of small business, which account for 99.8% of all enterprises in the State.</p>  <p>  My Department through its Agencies, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices, provides a range of tailored supports to small and medium enterprises. Supports include access to finance, management development, mentoring supports, business development programmes, market supports and trade promotion. </p>  <p>  In 2019 I am allocating an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;5m to the Local Enterprise Offices.  This extra funding will assist our Agencies to reach more of our SMEs to help grow and scale their businesses which are at the heart of our economic growth. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s High Potential Start-Up (HPSU) team provides support and advice to entrepreneurs and early stage companies that have an innovative product, service or technology, and the potential to export.</p>  <p>  The 31 Local Enterprises Offices (LEOs) are the &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other non-financial supports for anyone intending to start or grow their own business.  </p>  <p>  The LEOs provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service in relation to all relevant State supports available through agencies such as Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, Education and Training Boards, the Credit Review Office and Microfinance Ireland. The LEOs can also offer advice and guidance in areas such as Local Authority rates, Public Procurement and other regulations affecting business.</p>  <p>  In addition to the financial and soft supports provided by the Agencies, the Department has responsibility for the Supportingsmes.ie online tool. This is a cross government initiative to assist Irish start-ups and small businesses to navigate the range of Government supports. By answering 8 simple questions, the tool will then assist in directing you to your most relevant resource out of a total 170 Government supports listed. </p>  <p>  The Department also provides a Mapping of Supports compilation containing over 850 public and private sector supports for small businesses and start-ups and this can be obtained on the Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  The National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship launched in 2014, is a five-year plan developed to foster and promote an entrepreneurial spirit in the SME and Entrepreneurship ecosystem. The 96 actions laid out within, are currently being reviewed for progress by my Department and a final report will be compiled in 2020. </p>  <p>  To further my commitment to the future growth of our small and medium enterprises, my Department, in conjunction with the OECD Review of SME and Entrepreneurship issues and policies in Ireland in March 2018. </p>  <p>  The aim of the review is to provide tailored analysis and recommendations to DBEI and the Irish government on how to improve the design and implementation of national SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes, based on an assessment of the country&rsquo;s current SME and entrepreneurship performance, framework conditions and policies based on international comparisons. </p>  <p>  This is a collaborative body of work and involves considerable input from wider Government and stakeholders. </p>  <p>  This review will be completed this summer and published in quarter 3 of this year. DBEI will also receive a SME Roadmap in tandem. This will assist my Department in developing a SME Strategy which will be part of the Future Jobs Framework. It will inform the whole of Government how best to address the needs of our SMEs and entrepreneurs through policy intervention going forward.</p>  <p>  I and my Department will continue to hold structured dialogue with key stakeholders and advocate across Government to ensure the needs of SMEs are considered in the execution of national policy. </p></reply>

I am consistently engaging and listening to the needs of small businesses. I am aware of their importance as SMEs account for 99.8% of all enterprises in the State and are predominantly indigenous. We provide, principally through our Agencies, a range of tailored supports for enterprise of all types and sizes in Ireland. Supports include access to finance, management development, mentoring supports, business development programmes, market supports and trade promotion.</p>  <p>  We continue to hold structured dialogue with key stakeholders and we advocate across Government to ensure the needs of SMEs are considered in the execution of national policy.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the National Policy Statement on Entrepreneurship was launched, a five-year plan developed to foster and promote an entrepreneurial spirit in the SME and Entrepreneurship ecosystem. The 96 actions laid out within, are currently being reviewed for progress by my Department and a final report will be compiled in 2020.</p>  <p>  To further underpin this commitment, my Department in conjunction with the OECD early last year, commenced a Review of SME and Entrepreneurship issues and policies in Ireland. This is an 18-month project and it aims to provide tailored analysis and recommendations to DBEI and the Irish government on how to improve the design and implementation of national SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes, based on an assessment of the country&rsquo;s current SME and entrepreneurship performance, framework conditions and policies based on international comparisons. </p>  <p>  Government provides a number of supports and grants available to small businesses. A selection of these supports includes:</p>  <p>  - The Brexit Loan Scheme launched in March 2018, is a &euro;300 million loan fund offering affordable working capital to eligible Irish businesses with up to 499 employees, allowing them to innovate, change or adapt in response to challenges posed by Brexit,</p>  <p>  - My Department&rsquo;s online tool Supportingsmes.ie, directs small businesses to the most relevant State supports out of the 170 available,</p>  <p>  - New Frontiers is a national entrepreneur development programme delivered locally through the Institutes of Technology (IoT&rsquo;s) and funded by Enterprise Ireland,</p>  <p>  - Technology Centres are public-private research centres of excellence that connect industry to the third level sector to increase the generation and availability of new, industrially relevant knowledge,</p>  <p>  - The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) located nationwide offer a range of financial supports to assist with the establishment and growth of micro-enterprises, and</p>  <p>  - The LEOs also offer soft supports in the form of training (e.g. a Start Your Own Business course); provide a mentor to work with the business proposer; support micro enterprises in their loan applications to Micro Finance Ireland; and promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme. </p>  <p>  I allocated an extra &euro;14m to the enterprise agencies and regulatory bodies under my Department, who work with firms at the coalface to develop their supports for business.As part of the increase to my Department for 2019, I allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland to enhance our Global Footprint. This will help companies to diversify into new markets as the UK leaves the EU.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices are present in every single county in Ireland and provide crucial supports for SMEs and start ups throughout the country. This year I allocated an additional &euro;5m which is an increase of 22% on 2018. This extra funding will help deliver supports to more SMEs, particularly in the current changing landscape.</p>  <p>  I also announced, as part of Budget 2019, a longer term loan facility, the Future Growth Scheme, of up to &euro;300m to support capital investment by business, which is a collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, the Department of Finance, the European Investment Bank Group and SBCI.</p>  <p>  A specific focus is being given to helping Irish SMEs grow their international sales, diversify their markets and secure new investments in Ireland. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been very active in the 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign includes workshop events throughout the country aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit. Last year, we launched the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme.  This scheme offers competitively priced loans to eligible businesses that require short-term finance to overcome the impacts of Brexit. An important benefit of the scheme is that loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured.</p>  <p>  I will continue to enhance the effectiveness of these measures to assist our SMEs by providing them with the tools and incentives to grow their businesses. Such measures allow our SMEs to attract and retain talented individuals and encourage investment in their ideas for the businesses to scale and internationalise. </p></reply>

I am ensuring that my Department is at the forefront in the provision of supports and programmes to assist women to lead businesses, whether they are established businesses or new businesses. </p>  <p>  Women make up more than half the population in Ireland. However, women are less likely to work or run their own business. The ERSI 2016 report &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Economic outlook perspectives and policy challenges&rdquo; report highlights that the female labour market participation rate is 52.8%, whereas the male participation rate is 68.5% (2011-15). The CSO statistics show that women make up 60% of the inactive population, i.e. those not in the work force.</p>  <p>  This report indicates that female labour market participation has remained relatively robust during the recession, falling by just over one percentage point in the 2011-2015 period compared to the 2006-2010 period. The baseline projections from the ERSI are for participation rates to rise over the coming years. Female participation rate is projected to continue the upward trend that was interrupted by the crisis and rise to over 58 per cent over the next ten years.</p>  <p>  I want to encourage more women to join the workforce but more importantly to lead the workforce. To assist women into taking the helm of enterprises, the Government must lead by example. Through a concerted effort throughout departments and agencies, the participation by women on State boards has increased over the last few years to 41 per cent. Unfortunately, female representation on corporate boards is lagging far behind. Women currently make up just 18.1 percent of directors of Irish-registered ISEQ20 companies, which is significantly lower than the EU average of 26.2 percent for large publicly-listed companies. That is why the Better Balance for Better Business initiative was launched at an event in Government Buildings in July last year.</p>  <p>  The review group will examine the gender mix at the governance and senior management levels in companies, as well as the issues that arise in connection with the appointment of directors and senior management. Dr Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General of my Department, is one of the leaders on this group alongside Martin Shanahan, chief executive of IDA Ireland and Julie Sinnamon, chief executive of Enterprise Ireland. It will engage with companies to make the case for change and will report annually on its progress.</p>  <p>  Another method to encourage more businesses in Ireland to be led by women is to have businesses start with women at the helm. The 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Ireland data suggest a persistent gender divide in Ireland in the business startup rate in Ireland. A gender divide is evident in most countries. The 2017 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Report for Ireland indicates that the gender gap between male and female early stage entrepreneurs is 2:1. This reflects a continued narrowing of the margins since 2014 where it stood at 2.5 male to 1 female. </p>  <p>  My Department is leading the way in providing a variety of programmes through its agencies to increase the number of women starting businesses and assisting them at every stage, from potential business leaders to women growing their businesses. My Department published the first National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement in 2014. Action 19 of the policy statement is to promote female entrepreneurship through identification and promotion of female role models, targeted events and awards, support for female entrepreneur networks and promotion of a dedicated area on corporate websites. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland have been at the forefront of examining the variance in the female to male ratio of start-ups and have put in place measures to address the imbalance. The Competitive Start Fund (CSF) for Female Entrepreneurs aims to support early stage start-ups.  The establishment of this programme has resulted in a spill-over effect with increased female participation in other EI programmes. In 2012, just eight percent of the 97 High-Potential Start Ups (HPSUs) were female-led. However, 22% of HPSU approvals went to female-led companies in 2018 and 22% of CSF approvals were for companies led by female entrepreneurs.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also partners with key providers in providing training and capability development for early stage and establishes entrepreneurs.  It developed and supported a series of female accelerator programmes in partnership with knowledge providers.  These included:</p>  <p>  - Going for Growth,</p>  <p>  - DCU Ryan Academy Female Propeller Programme,</p>  <p>  - NDRC Female Founders Programme, and</p>  <p>  - CIT Female Exxcel Programme.</p>  <p>  - The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are actively engaged in encouraging and inspiring an increase in female-led businesses through initiatives such as the annual National Women&rsquo;s Enterprise Day and the Women in Business Networks. An important aspect of the networking programme is the promotion of successful female entrepreneurs as role models and the use of mentoring and networking opportunities which aims to build confidence of newly emerging female entrepreneurs and women operating established businesses.</p>  <p>  - We have seen progress in the numbers of women availing of many of the Services provided by the LEOs. For example, in 2017, 57% of participants attending core training programme, such as Start Your Own Business, were female.</p>  <p>  - From these actions and supports, it is evident that my Department has a strong focus on supporting female led enterprises. I want to see the numbers of these businesses increase for the betterment of the business environment and for society in general.</p></reply>

At a European level EU legislation provides for freedom of movement of professions, including doctors, among Member States. The Medical Council is the statutory body regulating medical doctors ensuring compliance with the Act.</p>  <p>  The Medical Council and medical practitioners are legally bound by the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 and must comply with the Act.  Part 6 of the Act provides for the registration of medical practitioners.  The Medical Council registers eligible medical practitioners in the appropriate Division of the Register, on fulfilling the application requirements. </p>  <p>  The  Medical Practitioners Act 2007 introduced a very significant change in the regulatory model for the medical profession in Ireland, providing for an enhanced and modern system of regulation. It ensures the protection of the public as the Act states that the object of the Medical Council is to protect the public by promoting and better ensuring high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registered medical practitioners. Another reform in the Act was the change to membership of the Council in order to provide for a non-medical majority on the Council. It is comprised of 13 non-medical members and 12 medical members. Medical practitioners work with other people of standing and expertise on the Council to advance the interests of patients and the public. </p>  <p>   A key responsibility of the Medical Council is to investigate complaints against medical doctors.</p>  <p>  Prior to the 2007 Act, Fitness to Practice hearings were heard in private. Since the commencement of the Act, a hearing before the Fitness to Practice Committee, which are established to inquire into a complaint, are held in public generally except in some circumstances as set out in the 2007 Act.  In addition to this the Act requires that the majority of the membership of the Fitness to Practice Committee shall consist of persons who are not medical practitioners. </p>  <p>   The 2007 Act also introduced the requirement for all registered doctors to comply and maintain professional competence.</p>  <p>   At the end of 2018 there were 22,996 doctors registered with the Medical Council.  In 2018 there were 396 complaints received against doctors.</p>  <p>  It is my view that the Medical Council is an effective regulatory body under the aegis of my Department. The significant changes brought about in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 reformed the regulation of medical doctors in Ireland to ensure there is no self regulation and to protect the public.</p></reply>

HIQA is an independent authority established to drive high-quality and safe care for health and social care services in Ireland. HIQA&rsquo;s mandate extends across a range of public, private and voluntary sector services. Reporting to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, HIQA&rsquo;s role is to develop standards, inspect and review health and social care services and support informed decisions on how services are delivered.</p><p>HIQA operates under the Health Act 2007, which sets out the functions which the Authority is to carry out. HIQA has responsibility for setting standards for healthcare services, and monitoring compliance with those standards. It also regulates facilities providing care for the elderly and those with disabilities, and has a role with regard to inspecting some of the social care services which are accessed by children to determine if they are meeting the relevant National Standards. In addition, it undertakes functions in relation to Health Information and Health Technology Assessment.</p><p>The Act provides HIQA with the power to set standards for the healthcare services delivered by the HSE, and then to undertake monitoring programmes to assess compliance with these standards. In this regard, HIQA published the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare in 2012; they represent the overarching standard which public health services are expected to meet. Flowing from these themes, HIQA have also developed standards for particular services, e.g. National Standards for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections in acute healthcare services. HIQA has in turn conducted a thematic inspection programme against these standards since 2012, which has resulted in the publication of over 300 reports of inspection visits to date. In addition, HIQA has also undertaken thematic inspection programmes in relation to nutrition and hydration in acute hospitals, and in relation to medication safety.</p><p>In such cases, HIQA typically undertakes both announced and unannounced inspection of healthcare facilities in order to ascertain the degree of adherence to expected standards. A report of the inspection visit will subsequently be published on HIQA&rsquo;s website. In cases where remedial action is required, depending on the severity of the risk identified, HIQA may draw the matter to the attention of hospital management during the inspection and request an immediate response, or in less severe cases, will raise the issue in writing. In either case, an appropriate management response would be expected.</p><p>The information the Deputy has requested is as follows;<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total percentage of unannounced inspections</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>42% </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>67% </td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>55% </td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>57% </td></tr></table></p></reply>

Its recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations so as to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.</p><p>On foot of a recommendation by NIAC, the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule was amended in 2016 to include the introduction of the Meningitis B vaccine for all babies born on or after 1 October 2016.  This change to the immunisation schedule took effect from 1 December 2016.  The first dose of the vaccine is administered to children when they reach two months of age; a second dose is administered at four months and a third and final dose at twelve months.  Meningitis B disease is most common in babies under 1 year of age and the scheduling of the administration of the vaccine under the immunisation programme as recommended by NIAC takes this into account.  </p><p>All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the Men B vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme.  </p><p>There are no plans to introduce a catch-up programme for the Men B vaccine to older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However, the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme.</p><p>In Ireland, the following meningitis vaccines are provided to children born on or after 1 October 2016 as part of the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule:</p><p>- 2 months - 6-in-1, pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) and Men B;</p><p>- 4 months - 6-in-1 and Men B (Meningococcal B);</p><p>- 6 months - 6-in-1, PCV and Men C (Meningococcal C);</p><p>- 12 months - Men B;</p><p>- 13 months - Hib/Men C and PCV.</p><p>Note that the 6-in-1 vaccine contains Hib (Haemophilus influenzae b).</p><p>Adolescents are also given a Men C booster vaccine in the first year of secondary school against meningitis as part of the School Immunisation Programme.</p><p>It is important to note that, although some of the recent notified cases are related to Meningitis B, none of the deaths have been attributed to this strain of the disease. </p></reply>

My Department is working on the development of draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation. </p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period. </p>  <p>  A draft General Scheme of a Bill is currently with legal advisers for advice and legal quality control review. Subject to legal advice, I expect to bring the heads of bill to Government soon. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect in 2019 subject to the legislative process.</p></reply>

The contract becomes in effect a lump sum contract. </p><p>The procurement strategy was developed and finalised from 2014 to 2016.  The Government Contracts Committee, the cross-government consultative committee for construction procurement matters, accepted that given the project&rsquo;s scale, complexity and its programme, the circumstances were such as to warrant a deviation from the standard form of Government contract and agreed a derogation from its use. </p><p>Reasons for adopting the two-stage process include:</p><p>- Early commencement on site, two years ahead of traditional procurement  (Phase A works commenced on site on 3 October 2017 and are nearing completion. Finalisation of instruction for Phase B main works in parallel allows these works to commence on site at end January;</p><p>- Market engagement with Irish and international contractors identified this procurement approach would attract increased competition in a situation where there are a very limited number of contractors with the ability to undertake a project of this scale. This was borne out by the competitive nature of the tender process with 5 contractors shortlisted for the main contract, 4 for the mechanical installation and 4 for the electrical installation;</p><p>- Claims are addressed up front, prior to main construction, rather than as is traditional throughout the project and beyond;</p><p>- Reduce exposure to rising inflationary pressures in the construction market through procurement at 2016 tender market rates (versus 2018 tender rates);</p><p>- Provide opportunity for the 3 contractors (main contractor and Mechanical &amp;amp; Electrical contractors) to influence/interrogate the detailed design and assume contractual responsibility for completeness including quantities at end of Stage 2 Design;</p><p>- The programmes for main works are fully aligned across 3 contractors with a single point accountability for site management;</p><p>- A Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) is determined prior to the instruction to proceed with the main Phase B works (with the GMP only adjustable for clearly defined exclusions such as changes in scope, excess national construction tender inflation above 4% post July 2019, changes in legislation (e.g. VAT, PRSI, statutory labour rates, building regulations);</p><p>- Other than in respect of exclusions, the GMP ceiling cannot be exceeded with any amount in excess not recoverable by contractors;</p><p>- Project substantially de-risked in relation to ground conditions with Phase A nearing completion prior to instructing and commencing the main hospital build (Phase B); and</p><p>- Incorporation of streamlined dispute resolution including using an independent expert whose decisions are binding on all parties. </p></reply>

The transfer of elective patients from Northern Ireland, which is the next phase in the implementation of the Network, commenced in April last. </p>  <p>  During the development of the Full Business Case it was acknowledged that further additional capacity in the paediatric intensive care unit in Crumlin would be required to accommodate all elective patients from Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy might wish to note that, on 3 November 2018 at the 3rd Annual Congenital Heart Disease Network Conference, I had the pleasure of announcing the formal approval by both jurisdictions of a 4 bedded extension to the paediatric intensive care unit at Our Ladies Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been requested to consider the costs of this extension in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plan for 2019, which is currently being finalised. </p>  <p>  This extension will allow for the expansion and enhancement of the services offered by the Network, benefitting more children and young people on the island of Ireland.</p></reply>

This work will support the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and Community First Responder Ireland (CFR Ireland) in their commitment to improve clinical outcomes for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA). </p>  <p>  The Strategy aims to make Ireland a leading &lsquo;beating heart&rsquo; in Europe as a result of implementing a strategic plan derived from national and international experience in implementing targets which address all the elements in the Chain of Survival.  In order to achieve the aims outlined, the Strategy discusses, among many other things, maximising public awareness of how to recognise OHCA; reducing emergency response time; the importance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training; bystander CPR training; &lsquo;CPR 4 Schools&rsquo;; CPR training in local communities; CPR training for government and HSE employees; the establishment of 250 Community First Responder Schemes in Ireland by 2020; guidance on the purchase, display, positioning, accessing, use and maintenance of automated external defibrillators and much more.</p>  <p>  The report has recently been finalised and when launched it is anticipated that the report of the OHCA Steering group will provide advice to the HSE and the Department on the most effective ways of addressing all of the elements in the Chain of Survival and improving survival rates for those suffering an out of hospital cardiac arrest.  </p></reply>

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland as a result of significant media coverage of the issues that emerged in late April. </p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening. </p>  <p>  This increased level of engagement with the programme is welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put immense pressure on lab capacity. The HSE has advised that results of smear tests may take up to 22 weeks from the time of the test. Although many results are returned in less time, some may take longer.</p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the contracted laboratories, and reports they have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, provide for overtime and manage annual leave in an effort to address this issue. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity internationally, which would improve the turnaround time of results. However, I am advised that cytology capacity is a challenge internationally, as countries start to move to primary HPV screening.</p>  <p>  As referenced by the Deputy, the HSE is developing a capacity plan which takes account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year. This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE, and detailed consideration will be given to the report and its contents as soon as it is received by my Department. </p></reply>

There is one outstanding vacancy, which under the Act is filled by a candidate nominated by the Minister for Education and Skills. I anticipate that the candidate&rsquo;s details will be submitted to the Department shortly.  Once this candidate has been nominated I will sign the appointment orders and letters of appointment to the members of the newly established board.

The stock was subject to high harvest rates for more than four decades, and fisheries were not managed during this time. While spurdog is showing some signs of recovery from the historical lows of the mid 2000s, the period is very short in comparison to the longer-term historical decline.</p>  <p>  The spawning biomass of this species is at an extremely low level, although conservation measures in recent years have had an impact in terms of stabilising the decline. The species is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to over-fishing. The scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) is that there should be no targeted fisheries in 2019 and 2020 and that any possible provision for landing of by-catch should only happen as part of a management plan, including close monitoring of the stock and fisheries. The Marine Institute fully supports the ICES advice and has very serious concerns about the state of the stock. </p>  <p>  A very limited quota is available (53t for Ireland) for use only in pilot schemes designed to reduce such by-catches. Any such schemes are subject to EU Commission approval and must relate to reducing by-catches of spurdog in other fisheries i.e. the targeting of spurdog would remain prohibited. Such a scheme for spurdog avoidance was explored by the Marine Institute and, following consultation with industry, a draft pilot scheme was submitted for review to the Commission&rsquo;s Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). </p>  <p>  STECF raised a number of queries about the proposed scheme, in particular on whether or not it would result in a reduction in catches of spurdog relative to the catches that would occur in the absence of a scheme. Having considered the STECF comments and concerns, the Marine Institute reviewed the draft scheme and has now advised that Ireland should not proceed further with the spurdog avoidance scheme but rather work collaboratively with other Member States and the Commission to explore possible management measures going forward. </p></reply>

The objective of the landing obligation is to eliminate the wasteful and unsustainable practice of discarding fish at sea. This will result in benefits both to the marine environment and to fishermen alike, securing fish stocks for the future. The application of the landing obligation for all Irish stocks in 2019, coupled with a move towards fishing at maximum sustainable yield levels (rebuilding  stocks to a sustainable optimum), are very positive developments for fishermen and for the broader goal of sustainability.</p>  <p>  In order to support the rollout of the landing obligation, in December 2017 I announced a quota balancing policy for pelagic stocks. Quota balancing means that where a vessel exceeds its catch limit for a particular stock during a fishery management period, a balancing adjustment is made from a future catch limit for that vessel. Quota balancing is a management, conservation and rational exploitation measure that will aid in matching catch limit to actual catch to support the landing obligation requirements. </p>  <p>  Mackerel is the main pelagic stock targeted by Irish fishermen. Preliminary data provided for 2018 Mackerel landings indicated that where vessels landed over their 2018 catch limits, most of these vessels landed less than 10% over their 2018 catch limit for Mackerel. A very small number of vessels landed far in excess of their 2018 catch limits for Mackerel. Thus, to allow for quota balancing, I agreed that initial 2019 quota allocations for mackerel be restricted to a lower level. A multiplying factor applies in Quota Balancing so that the greater the excess catch when compared to the catch limit, the larger the balancing adjustment that will be made. In a small number of cases, where vessels caught far in excess of their allocated catch limit in 2018, their 2019 catch limit was reduced accordingly.</p>  <p>  However, I have made provision for a maximum quota balancing adjustment, so that no more than 80% of the catch limit available to a vessel for a relevant pelagic stock should be applied in an individual fishery management period. This would mean that vessels would receive as a minimum 20% of the catch limit for that pelagic stock that would have been available to the vessel for that fishery management period had quota balancing not been applied. The licence holder will be granted an Authorisation and/or Notification to fish the reduced quantity of that stock for the fishery management period and any outstanding quota balancing adjustment still remaining at the end of the fishery management period is carried over into a subsequent fishery management period until a full adjustment is made.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that the quota balancing policy was introduced following discussions with the Quota Management Advisory Committee and a public consultation and received the support of the majority of fishing representative organisations.</p>  <p>  Licence holders were sent the provisional details of quota balancing for Mackerel last week and advised that no further action was required on their behalf, unless they did not agree with the data on their provisional quota balancing statement. If licence holders did not agree with the data, they were advised that enquiries were to be made by a set date. Declared Landings/Trips enquiries are to be submitted to the SFPA while Catch Limit(s)/Calculation of Balancing Adjustment enquiries are to be submitted to the Department.  In the event of a non-reply by this set date, all data (as submitted by the Master of the Vessel) will be deemed final for the purposes of Quota Balancing only.  Licence holders were further advised that a final quota balancing statement will issue after the final date for enquires has passed, and that and a balancing adjustment will be made, at the earliest possible opportunity, against future catch limit(s).</p>  <p>  Quota balancing operates independent of any action being considered or taken by the control authorities and the data being used is that logged by the master of the fishing vessel in the landing declaration submitted at the end of each trip for each vessel.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council. </p>  <p>  Prior to the financial crisis, applications for funding for road improvement projects would have been considered as part of the Specific Improvement, and Strategic Regional and Local Road Grant Schemes. However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The NDP does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes.  </p>  <p>   Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  </p>  <p>  Under the capital project appraisal process a Preliminary Appraisal has to be submitted in relation to each proposed project.  Once an appraisal is received it is assessed taking into account other competing projects and the overall roads budget. No Preliminary Appraisal has been received from Westmeath County Council in respect of the R392.</p></reply>

It was stipulated that the individual appointed would lead on the strategic direction and corporate governance of Tusla. </p>  <p>  The advertisement also sought candidates with a career history at a sufficiently senior level in a complex organisation of scale, or equivalent experience, which would demonstrate strong leadership skills, including the ability to ensure that the Board of Tusla guides, challenges and supports the CEO and executive team to deliver major reform, whilst holding them to account in doing so.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I meet the Chairperson and other representatives of the Board on a regular basis. It is the role of the Chairperson to utilise the range of skills of Board members appropriately.

While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so. </p>  <p>  Arrangements are in place to provide that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year can generally continue to be paid benefit until pension age (66) provided they satisfy the contribution conditions.  Recipients may continue to get a payment if they find part-time or casual work.  This generally means that for each day that a person is employed, 1/5th of the normal rate of jobseeker's benefit is deducted.  In order to continue to receive a jobseekers payment they must be unemployed for at least 4 days out of 7.  In the interest of fairness these rules apply to all jobseeker's benefit customers.</p>  <p>  Ordinarily, all those in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment must engage with the Department&rsquo;s activation process and can face penalty rates if they refuse to engage with Department offers of training or education.  However these criteria were eased for people aged 62 and over.  They can stillavail voluntarily of an array of supports, which are available from the Department if they wish to return to work, training or education.</p>  <p>  In terms of the application process, detailed information is required by the Department to determine the identity of the individual, other members of the household, previous employment, payment details, etc.  If any person is experiencing difficulty in completing this process they should contact their local Intreo office for assistance.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The 2019 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;1.95 billion.</p>  <p>  The jobseekers allowance scheme is a means tested payment which is already available to all jobseekers including those in self-employment. There are currently over 6,900 self-employed recipients in receipt of jobseekers allowance. People who were previously self-employed and are now in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance have access to activation measures available to other jobseeker recipients. If a self-employed person is engaged in farming they may qualify for the means-tested farm assist payment which is currently paid to approximately 6,600 farmers. </p>  <p>  The new scheme for the self-employed, which I announced as part of the 2019 Budget measures, will extend a PSRI insurance based benefit to the self-employed who lose employment. This measure will be introduced in late 2019 and builds on other significant improvements for the self-employed in recent years such as access to invalidity pension and treatment benefits in Budget 2017.  This measure is part of the Government&rsquo;s stated aim of creating a supportive environment for entrepreneurship, including providing an income safety net to employees and the self-employed alike. </p>  <p>  Applicants will have to satisfy the qualifying conditions for the new jobseekers benefit  support including a PRSI contribution requirement and have sustained a substantial loss of employment. The specific details of this scheme are currently being examined as part of the legislative process.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-31a.688.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019013100055#WRK07500"><p>The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures), published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014, includes a target to reduce by two-thirds the number of children in consistent poverty in 2011 by 2020.  Meeting this target means lifting more than 70,000 children out of poverty by that date.  </p>  <p>  Under the BOBF Framework, a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty has been adopted, building on the lifecycle approach in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and informed by the European Commission Recommendation on &lsquo;Investing in children: Breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  The latest data from the 2017 Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) show a significant reduction in the consistent poverty rate for children, which decreased from 10.9% to 8.8%, a reduction of 2.1 percentage points, the second highest reduction in the rate since the collection of SILC data began in 2004.  </p>  <p>  The full benefit of the growing economy and the increases introduced in more recent Budgets has yet to be seen.  Budgets 2018 and 2019 have included measures specifically aimed at supporting families on low incomes through increases in qualified child rates, increases in earnings disregards for One Parent Family and Jobseeker Transition payments, and an increase in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.</p>  <p>  These increased supports along with increasing employment rates suggest that we can expect further decreases in the poverty rates once the 2018 figures become available. </p>  <p>  However, the challenge Ireland faces in trying to achieve the child poverty target needs some perspective: at the height of the economic boom in 2008, when the consistent poverty rate for children was its lowest, there were 68,000 children in consistent poverty.  So, in order to meet the target, Ireland will have to be more than twice as effective as our best ever performance to date.  </p>  <p>  While social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and Ireland is among the best performing EU States for reducing poverty through social transfers, tackling child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality affordable services in areas such as education, health, housing and childcare.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the final stages of drafting the new Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy which will assemble in one place the range of policy measures across government departments that are designed to address the different aspects of poverty and social exclusion.  The new strategy will include a programme of work to identify the actions and services that have the most significant impact on reducing poverty and deprivation for different groups, including children.  </p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. </p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  My Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced later in Q1 2019, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in mid 2019.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p>  <p>  Proposals for wind energy developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning Acts, in the same manner as other proposed developments.  Therefore, it is not intended to place a moratorium on applications for planning permission for wind farm developments as referred to pending the finalisation of the revisions to the 2006 Guidelines. </p></reply>

My future role, as Minister, will be limited to managing the property aspects of developments on behalf of the State and I will have no role in the environmental assessment of projects.

In addition, a high level Marine Legislation Steering Group was established in 2018 to facilitate the development of marine legislation with cross-Departmental impacts. </p>  <p>  Legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the draft text, received in November 2018, raised a number of complex matters currently being considered by the Marine Legislation Steering Group.

Data is collected by my Department on a quarterly basis from local authorities with regard to the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns.  Information up to Q3 2018, including in relation to number and value of mortgage drawdowns, is available on the Department's website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/housing/statistics/house-prices-loans-and-profile-borrowers/local-authority-loan-activity, and this information is updated on a quarterly basis as additional data is compiled.</p>  <p>  Regarding the timeframes in which applications are processed by local authorities, in October 2018 my Department requested initial data on the length of time taken for the processing of applications within each local authority area. This found that it takes an average time of circa seven weeks from submitting a completed application to a local authority to receiving approval under the scheme, which is in line with the expected timeframe of 6-8 weeks as set out on the RIHL website. Approvals are valid for six months to allow applicants time to source a property to purchase.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency provides a central support service which assesses loan applications that are made to the local authorities for the RIHL and makes recommendations to the authorities as to whether loans should be offered to applicants. The most recent data available from the Housing Agency with regards to its assessment process indicated that as of the end of December 2018, a total of 61 applications remained in process at that point. This is out of an overall total of 3,745 applications submitted to the Agency since the scheme commenced in February 2018.</p></reply>

Following detailed consideration and in light of the additional works which are now required for the Centre, public procurement rules and legal advice indicate that total public funding for the project could be increased by up to &euro;10 million to &euro;30 million comprised of grant aid of &euro;21 million and a repayable loan of &euro;9 million.  Discussions are ongoing with Cork City Council as to how this funding could be allocated. </p>  <p>  Capital grants of this type from my Department are managed and paid under a Service Level Agreement which sets out the terms and conditions to be met by the project promoter, in this case Cork City Council.</p></reply>
