Cooke.  </p><p>The Commission was initially expected to report on the sale by NAMA of its Northern Ireland portfolio, known as Project Eagle, by the end of June 2018.  However, the time-frame for the Commission to report on the Project Eagle Investigation has been extended on several occasions following requests from the Commission in its Interim Reports.  </p><p>In the Commission&rsquo;s Ninth Interim Report which was submitted in November 2020, it requested a further extension as &ldquo;it would be prudent to allow for a further three-month period to bring its work to a conclusion.&rdquo;  The rationale provided in the Interim report included the impact of Covid-19 public health restrictions on the Commission&rsquo;s work and that &ldquo;one individual, who had previously declined, agreed to provide evidence to assist the investigation&rdquo;.</p><p>In light of this rationale, and the limited extension of three months requested, and consistent with my functions as specified Minister under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, I didn&rsquo;t believe there was a strong argument against extending the timeframe as sought by the Commission.  Given these circumstances, and the ongoing pressures of business arising from Covid-19, I didn&rsquo;t deem it necessary to consult further with Oireachtas members on this occasion.  As with all of the Commission&rsquo;s Interim Reports, a copy has been laid before the Oireachtas and is also available at .  The possibility of consulting with Oireachtas representatives on any future such requests by the Commission will be considered in light of the circumstances in which they arise.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-13a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021011300054#WRB00400"><p>The regulation of supermarket fridges falls under EU Regulation, namely Regulation (EU) 2019/2024 of 1 October 2019, laying down ecodesign requirements for refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function, and Regulation (EU) 2019/2018 with regard to energy labelling of refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function. </p>  <p>  The Regulations apply to refrigerators with direct sales functions that will be placed on the market across the EU after March 1, 2021, setting minimum requirements for energy efficiency, and ensuring that accurate information is available regarding energy efficiency to those purchasing such appliances. The regulations are technology neutral: they do not specify the technology needed to achieve the design technical specifications. This approach is taken so as not to inhibit innovation. While the installation of doors/curtains can indeed make these products more efficient, it is not specifically stated in the Regulation that they need to be used to achieve the requirement but in many instances, manufacturers will have doors to comply with the Regulation, if it is not already the case. Over time, supermarkets will replace their stock of refrigerators and the incentive to update to more eco-friendly fridges will increase as the carbon tax increases energy costs.</p>  <p>  Regulation (EU) 2019/2024 also provides that manufacturers, importers or authorised representatives of refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function make available spare parts for doors (e.g. door handles) to professional repairers and end-users to ensure that fridge energy consumption is minimised throughout the life time of the fridge. The combination of the saving generated by the more energy efficient new generation of fridges and pressure from customers will ensure that supermarkets rapidly replace the fridges that have no doors. Compliance of fridges with the new regulation will be the responsibility of DECC, supported by SEAI enabled by SI 2020/625.</p></reply>

Ireland does not ratify international conventions until it has been determined that national law is in line with the provisions of the international instrument.   </p>  <p>  Convention 190 is the first ever international instrument on the very important issues of eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work. Ireland already has very strong protections in law to combat violence and harassment in the world of work and has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention).  </p>  <p>  My officials are engaging with relevant Departments and offices to establish the extent to which domestic legislative provisions already provide for the rights and entitlements enunciated in the Convention, as well as legislative amendments, if any, that may be required to enable ratification.   </p>  <p>  As part of that process, my officials will undertake a stakeholder consultation with the social partners and other interested parties.</p></reply>

This Strategy set out a vision and practical actions and steps to encourage and assist more citizens and small businesses to get online.</p>  <p>  The original focus of the scheme was targeted at small and micro enterprises that were considered to be at risk of being left behind by the digital divide. The scheme was designed to be a catalyst for a change in behaviour of small business towards trading online.  As such, it was envisaged that the scheme would not support all business, but rather encourage a sufficient number to make the transition which, in turn, would drive an organic demand from the remaining businesses.</p>  <p>  At the beginning of 2020 applicants had 9 months to complete their project. Lockdown restrictions in March 2020 highlighted the necessity of businesses having online trading capacity to generate sales resulting in a significant increase in the number of applications received by the Local Enterprise Offices. From 8 June 2020 new successful applicants had 4 months to complete their project. This condition pertained until the end of 2020.</p>  <p>The scheme was transferred to my Department which will operate the Trading Online Voucher scheme for 2021 and subsequent years in line with the terms and conditions and eligibility requirements. The claim period for a Trading Online Voucher has been increased to 6 months as of January 1 2021.</p></reply>

However, in response to the high demand, the scheme was expanded in July of 2020 by a further &euro;500m in lending to help businesses in responding to the challenges of COVID-19 and Brexit.</p><p>Two of the participating finance providers (AIB and Bank of Ireland) in the scheme have currently suspended new loan applications while they process a significant pipeline of existing applications. However, businesses can still currently apply for lending with other participating providers (KBC, Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank).</p><p>As of December 24th2020, there had been 2,742 businesses approved for lending under the Future Growth Loan Scheme for a total value of &euro;554.6m in loan approvals. There is still a very significant amount of lending capacity remaining in the scheme to help SMEs that are looking to access finance to facilitate strategic investment. I encourage businesses interested in the scheme to approach the lenders that are currently accepting new applications. I would also encourage businesses to regularly monitor the SBCI website, <i></i>, for updates on the cohort of lenders participating in the scheme and those that are open for new applications.</p></reply>

The Plan sets out how businesses should operate at five different levels. The Country is, at present, at Level 5 and within Level 5 people should work from home unless it is absolutely necessary to attend in person.</p><p>All employees should work from home unless essential for work, which is an essential health, social care or other essential service and cannot be done from home.</p><p>I would stress, however, that, at this particular critical juncture, given the seriousness of the overall situation with COVID-19 cases across the Community and the resulting pressure on our hospital systems, it is vital that employers make provision for employees to work from home unless they are delivering an essential service as listed on <i>www.gov.ie</i>and cannot work for home.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, I issued a statement last week underlining the seriousness of this issue.</p><p>While an employer is responsible, in the first instance, for determining what work can be done remotely, employers must bear in mind that the overarching public health advice is that employees should work remotely.</p><p>Employers and workers should seek to resolve any matters relating to remote working at a local level through mutual dialogue and engagement. Where this is not possible a dispute may be referred to the State's workplace relations services for mediation or conciliation. The Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is providing services on both a face to face and virtual basis. Advice can be obtained from the Information &amp;amp; Customer Service of the WRC at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or 059 9178990 or from its website<i>www.wrc.ie</i>.</p><p>The Health and Safety Authority has produced a detailed guidance for both employers and employees in relation to home-working on a temporary basis during COVID-19 restrictions. This guidance will help employers to understand the requirements, and steps to take, when setting up working-from-home arrangements for employees from a health and safety perspective. The guidance is available on-line at <i>www.hsa.ie</i></p><p>While the Health and Safety Authority has no role in determining which employees can work from home or not, it carries out, along with a number of other State Agencies, compliance inspections with the Work Safely Protocol. Where non-compliance with the Protocol is discovered the HSA can use various mechanisms at its disposal to ensure that the necessary measures are put in place.</p><p>Any worker with concerns about health and safety standards at their place of work can contact the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s Workplace Contact Unit (WCU) for detailed advice including advice on compliance with the Work Safely Protocol. The WCU can be contacted by phone at Lo-call 1890289389 (landline) or (01) 6147000 or by email at wcu@hsa.ie.</p><p>I would also like to highlight the fact that there is a wide range of Government supports available to help businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.

The restrictions introduced to limit the spread of Covid-19 have led to the cancellation or deferral of many events and services, including weddings. In many cases where it is not possible to proceed with a wedding due to these restrictions, the couple will be able to agree on an alternative date and the question of a refund will not arise.  </p><p>Whether a couple are entitled to a refund of their deposit where it is not possible to reschedule the wedding will depend in the first instance on the terms and conditions of their contract.  Couples who find themselves in this situation should first check the terms and conditions of their contract and, in particular, the terms relating to cancellations and the refund of deposits and other prepayments. If a term of the contract provides for the refund of deposits in the event of a cancellation, the business may not subsequently change that term without the consumer&rsquo;s agreement.  While I fully appreciate that businesses are facing severe financial pressures at present, they should deal fairly with consumers who find it necessary to cancel contracts for weddings and are seeking a refund of their deposits.  </p><p>The terms of standard form contracts of the kind that typically govern weddings are subject to assessment for unfairness under the Regulations on unfair terms in consumer contracts.  The aim of the Regulations is to protect consumers against the abuse of power by sellers and suppliers, in particular by means of one-sided contract terms. The Regulations provide for example that among the terms that may be regarded as unfair are terms that permit sellers or suppliers to retain sums paid by the consumer where the latter decides not to perform the contract without providing for the consumer to receive compensation of an equivalent amount from the seller or supplier where the latter is the party cancelling the contract.  </p><p>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of the Regulations on the control of unfair terms in standard form consumer contracts. Information on matters relating to consumer contracts, including on cancellations and refunds for weddings and other contracts, can be accessed on the CCPC website at <i></i>.</p><p>The enormous disruption to commercial activity caused by Covid-19 has thrown up many difficult situations for consumers and businesses. If current consumer law proves not to have provided adequate protection for consumers in these situations, I will consider and, where justified, bring forward proposals to strengthen that law where I can do so without contravening EU consumer protection legislation. In the next couple of months, I intend to bring forward proposals for a comprehensive, consolidated Consumer Rights Bill that will set out rights and remedies for consumer contracts for goods, services, and digital content and will include proposals to strengthen the existing provisions on unfair terms in consumer contracts. This Bill will provide an opportunity to address any gaps in consumer protection revealed by the application by businesses of the terms of consumer contracts in cases arising from Covid-19.</p></reply>

From 18 May 2020 to 31 December 2020 the Health and Safety Authority carried out over 2,200inspections in the construction sector which addressed compliance with the Protocol. Inspections were carried out on a range of small to very large construction projects including projects with over 1000 employees.</p><p>The level of compliance found within the construction sector during this period has been very good and in line with the generally high level of compliance with Work Safely Protocol across all sectors.

Ireland&rsquo;s customer experience companies serve key markets in Ireland, the UK, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and the US and Canada. Increasingly, newer markets in Asia Pacific, Africa, and Latin America are being served.</p>  <p>  Every job created in Ireland is hard won against increasing competition from a growing number of potential locations. Investors in this sector seek skilled employees, international connectivity, energy infrastructure, telecommunications and services infrastructure. In 2019, IDA Ireland, along with Enterprise Ireland and the Customer Contact Management Association, published a transformation strategy for the sector. That strategy cited technology adoption, people change and services transformation as key areas of focus for the sector to remain competitive against international competition.</p>  <p>IDA Ireland will work with its existing client base to assist and support their growth and expansion in Ireland and will continue to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s strong value proposition to prospective overseas investors to attract mobile foreign investment.</p></reply>

The company&rsquo;s R&amp;D Centre for Digital and artificial intelligence (AI) in Galway is a key driver of technology innovation for Genesys as it works to transform the way brands and people connect in a digital-first world.</p>  <p>  In November 2020 Diligent Corporation, a leading modern governance company, announced that it is establishing its European hub in Galway. Diligent plans to create more than 200 local jobs in Galway across several business functions, including customer support, customer success, finance, product, HR and marketing.</p>  <p>  In July 2020 Globalization Partners, which simplifies global business by enabling companies to hire and retain team members in 180+ countries without the complexity of setting up international branch offices or subsidiaries, announced plans to hire 25 technology positions in Galway. These newly created positions include software engineers, technology leads, help centre support, DevOps engineers, UI/UX designers and many others located in the company&rsquo;s Galway centre of operations. </p>  <p>  In June 2020 Triggerfish, the animation studio behind Netflix&rsquo;s first original animated TV series from Africa, announced it is to establish its first international studio in Galway. Founded in 1996, Triggerfish was instrumental in the birth of the South African animation industry, co-founding the country&rsquo;s official animation association as well as an ongoing monthly screening and networking event. The project is expected to create 60 new jobs over the next three years.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future, IDA Ireland will continue to draw the attention of multinationals looking to invest or expand in County Galway.  The IDA continues to engage with key stakeholders on the ground in Galway including the local authorities, the education sector, Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Offices (LEO) and both overseas and indigenous companies with a view to generating new employment opportunities. </p>  <p>Regional development is at the centre of IDA&rsquo;s new strategy, "Driving Recovery &amp;amp; Sustainable Growth 2021-2024".  IDA Ireland is committed to the pursuit of balanced, compact regional development which can deliver complementary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development. IDA will target half of all investments (400) from 2021- 2024 to regional locations and maintain the same high level of investment as targeted in IDA&rsquo;s previous strategy for each region of the country.

CETA is designed to benefit EU and Canadian companies through improved trade flows in support of increased employment for our citizens.  The elimination of tariffs, reduced trade barriers and simplified customs procedures that flow from CETA all make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to export to Canada and vice versa.  Outside of Europe, the US and China, Canada is our largest indigenous export market with more than 400 Enterprise Ireland clients doing business in the Canadian market employing over 6,000 people.</p><p>Diversifying trade is an important part of our Brexit response and it will be an important factor in our recovery post-pandemic.  To this end, the best way to achieve export growth and market diversification is by improving market access and reducing costs of entering those markets which is what CETA is designed to achieve.  Given our historic ties with Canada, Ireland&rsquo;s enterprises are particularly well placed to benefit from CETA.</p><p>The main benefits for Ireland in this Agreement include:</p><p>the opening up of public procurement markets in the Canadian provinces giving Irish firms increased access to Canadian public sector purchasing;</p><p>unlimited tariff-free access for most of our important food exports;</p><p>a low beef import quota from Canada to the EU thereby safeguarding our important EU market in this area; and</p><p>the recognition of product standards and certification, saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>Furthermore, the benefits and opportunities to business in the Agreement will be especially valuable for SMEs, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, which have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.  Indeed, CETA contains an entire chapter exclusively dedicated to SMEs aimed at ensuring they can take full advantage of the improved market access.</p><p>In services and investment, CETA is the most far-reaching agreement the EU has ever concluded. Almost half of the benefits anticipated from CETA are expected in the services sector where CETA makes it easier for EU individuals and companies to provide services to Canadian customers and vice versa.  It covers services such as legal, accountancy, transport and telecoms and there are significant opportunities for Ireland given its strengths in services, with services exports accounting for approximately 60% of all exports in 2019.</p><p>CETA has provisionally applied across the EU since the 21st September 2017 which has allowed us to see the practical benefits of this Agreement.  Exports of Irish goods and services to Canada totalled approximately &euro;3.9 billion in 2019 a 35% increase compared to 2016, the last full year, prior to the provisional application of CETA.  Furthermore, the cost of service barriers to trade will, on average, be reduced under CETA by 10 per cent in Canada and by 4 per cent in the EU.  The benefits and opportunities to business in the removal of non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs) - in areas such as regulatory co-operation, trade facilitation measures, streamlined administration etc., will directly benefit Irish consumers.  </p><p>To date, 15 Member States have signalled to the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union the completion of their respective national ratification procedures while several other Member States are currently progressing approval of the Agreement.  Ireland, like many Member States, was awaiting the opinion of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regarding the compatibility of CETA with EU law prior to our commencing the formal ratification process for Ireland.  </p><p>The Opinion of the Court in Case 1/17 was issued on 30th April 2019 and held that the dispute settlement mechanism in CETA is compatible with EU law and complies with (i) the principle of autonomy of EU law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU for the interpretation of EU law, (ii) the principle of autonomy of EU law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the CJEU for the interpretation of EU law, and (iii) the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in particular of the right of access to a court and right to an independent and impartial tribunal under the Charter.  The Opinion of the CJEU, allowed Member States to proceed with domestic ratification, according to the requirements of their national law.</p><p>International trade agreements are not part of domestic law so this is why separate adjudication arrangements are required in the event of disputes under the Agreement.  All international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements. Moreover, where such agreements cover investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments e.g. Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS).</p><p>ISDS which has been in existence since the 1950s, enables overseas investors to resolve disputes with the government of the country where their investment is made through binding international arbitration.  ISDS has been included in more than 2,000 investment treaties but has proved controversial in recent times and is now regarded as outdated by the European Commission.  In this regard, the Irish Government considered the European Commission was right to seek to address the concerns raised by NGOs and others regarding ISDS in seeking to develop a new replacement mechanism &ndash; the Investment Court System (ICS) &ndash; to address concerns on transparency, legitimacy and public interest - and ICS is the Investment Dispute Settlement system incorporated in CETA. </p><p>Investors may utilise either national courts or the ICS, but cannot &quot;forum-shop&quot;.  Equally, it is important to remember that a Canadian firm can seek to sue the government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our Courts whether CETA exists or not.  CETA simply provides an arbitration alternative.  That alternative, unlike a challenge in the Courts, cannot find any act by Government to be <i>ultra vires</i>or unconstitutional - it is only concerned with redress for proven harm.</p><p>ICS addressees the concerns around the old ISDS system through:</p><p>- Greater transparency &ndash; hearings will be open and comments available on-line, and a right to intervene for parties with an interest in the dispute will be provided;</p><p>- Safeguards to prevent forum-shopping;</p><p>- Provisions for the swift dismissal of Frivolous claims should they arise;</p><p>- The maintenance of a clear distinction between international law and domestic law;</p><p>- The avoidance of Multiple and parallel proceedings in the ICS and National Courts, and;</p><p>- The establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators.</p><p>The reforms to investment protection mean the ICS will involve: </p><p>- a public Investment Court System composed of a first instance Tribunal and an Appeal Tribunal;</p><p>- the establishment of a permanent list of arbitrators with qualifications &ndash; comparable to those required for the members of permanent international courts, from which members will be selected to hear individual cases.</p><p>- precise limitations on the ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal.</p><p>Under CETA the right of EU Member States (and Canada) to regulate for public policies (e.g. in health, environment, security) is fully preserved, and it is made clear that the deal does not imply an expectation that public policies will remain unchanged.  Further, an investor&rsquo;s loss of profits will not be sufficient grounds for making a claim against a Government.  Any claim must be based on discriminatory and unfair treatment. </p><p>Finally, Ireland has been a beneficiary of significant levels of Foreign Direct Investment or FDI for many decades with more and more Irish enterprises also making overseas investments in key markets in recent years.  An Investment Protection Agreement, such as the ICS model in CETA, is, therefore, a key plank of assisting in the ongoing free-flow of mobile FDI making the EU and Ireland a more attractive location for mobile Canadian FDI than other Third Countries where Canadian Investors would not have available to them the protections that such an Agreement provides.</p></reply>

MFI and officials in my Department have developed this loan product to operate under MFI&rsquo;s remit which means the loans are available to micro businesses, eg, businesses with less than 10 employees and &euro;2 million turnover.</p>  <p>  For these businesses the impact of Brexit is more likely to be felt in imports and supply chains rather than exports. They will need to source new supply chains resulting in the need for cash payments for new stock. It is expected that many of these loans will be short term; less than 12 months. Hence the flexibility of the term of the loan from 6 months to 3 years.</p>  <p>  The loan range of &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000 is the requisite size for these smaller companies. It will assist them counter the initial disruption of Brexit and give them breathing space to normalise any import of supply chain changes going into the future. </p>  <p>  To end of December, there were no draw downs under the MFI Brexit Business Loan in Cork or elsewhere.  MFI are ready to deliver these loans. For the size of these loans, they have favourable interest rates of 4.5% APR if submitted through the Local Enterprise Office (LEO) Network or other referral partners or 5.5% APR if applied directly. This is to encourage these businesses to contact their LEO so as to avail of any other relevant training or potential for grant aid. There are no fees or charges or any hidden costs and there is no penalty for early repayment.</p></reply>

The lists are subject to twice yearly reviews which are evidence based and are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, a public consultation process, input from the relevant policy Departments and the Economic Migration Inter-Departmental Group, chaired by the Department.  Account is also taken of contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID 19.  </p>  <p>  In May 2018, following consideration of a detailed business case submitted by the sector, a pilot quota-based scheme was introduced to remove the occupations of horticulture worker, meat processing operative and dairy farm assistant from the ineligible occupations list.  This pilot scheme allows workers from non-EEA countries to access employment opportunities.  To date this pilot scheme has proved very successful for a range of employers in the sector. The quota for dairy farm assistant has now expired, with all 150 permits issued.  </p>  <p>  The first review of 2020 of the employment permits occupations lists concluded in October 2020. Following consideration of the submissions received and taking account of the current economic environment in particular the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market, the report recommended that no changes be made to the occupations lists at this time, apart from two technical amendments. </p>  <p>  The second review of the occupations lists is now underway with the public consultation phase having closed on 11 December 2020. Submissions have been received in respect of Dairy Farm Assistants and they will be considered as part of the review, the findings of which will be finalised in early 2021.</p></reply>

The uptake of these supports has been strong and indicates that businesses are taking action in response to this period of disruption.</p><p>Budget 2021 provided a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. The measures in the Budget are in addition to those announced in the July Stimulus, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, cash for businesses, low cost loans, commercial rates waivers and deferred tax liabilities.

Both changes increase in the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. This change to payment rates will apply in respect of all existing and new applicants.</p><p>We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme.

Budget 2021 allocated significant additional resources to Departments to provide supports to sectors. I would highlight the &euro;395m provided to the Department of Transport and the &euro;222m allocated to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p>  <p>  These monies are additional to the other schemes available from bodies under my own Department such as credit guarantee schemes and supports provided to business via EI, InterTrade Ireland and Local Enterprise Offices. The Revenue tax debt warehousing scheme and the COVID restrictions support scheme are also available to businesses to help them manage the impact of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Maintaining a competitive business environment will be a core focus of the forthcoming National Economic Plan.  Government is aware that insurance reform is a priority for the car rental sector and there is a shared determination across Government to reduce insurance costs and improve availability of cover. The Government will drive the implementation of the recently published Action Plan for Insurance Reform which will see insurance reform in three broad areas over the next 18 months: tackling cost concerns and increasing transparency; legal reforms; and PIAB reform and increasing competition.</p></reply>

This facility has been a substantial employer in Tralee and a major contributor to the economy of the locality and wider region over the past 30 years.  The news was deeply distressing in particular for the workers and families who were directly impacted by the decision.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has engaged extensively with the company, both in Tralee and its Corporate Headquarters, since the announcement, to explore options for the marketing of the facility and its skilled workforce and to highlight the range of supports available to impacted employees. IDA Ireland and others are also actively exploring opportunities to identify other businesses who may have skills requirements and employment opportunities for the impacted employees, locally and across the region.  </p>  <p>  Local stakeholders, including the local offices of the Department of Social Protection (Intreo), Munster Technological University, Tralee and Kerry Education and Training Board have been in contact with the company offering their services to provide assistance to the impacted employees in areas of retraining, education, starting your own business and income supports. Borg Warner is also committed to providing supports to their employees.</p>  <p>  Borg Warner have indicated that they are not hiring replacement labour in place of existing jobs.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, 80 people working at the facility departed and prior to this a small number of contractors were temporarily employed by the company to meet production volumes to year-end. As planned and previously communicated by Borg Warner, they will close the facility on 31 March 2021.</p>  <p>  Despite this disappointing development, I am confident that we will be able to attract replacement investment for Tralee. There are currently 17 IDA Ireland client companies in Kerry employing 2,153 staff.  IDA Ireland will continue and redouble its efforts to attract Foreign Direct Investment to Kerry, notwithstanding the serious global economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on global FDI flows.  IDA Ireland has just launched its new four-year strategy and as part of its property development programme, is committed to developing a new Advance Building Solution in Tralee to support the winning of additional FDI. The focus is, and will continue to be, on supporting  existing companies and attracting new investment to Kerry and to all parts of Ireland.</p></reply>

However, site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as a significant percentage of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies.  2020 has presented undeniable challenges to our ongoing efforts to sustain and grow foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland. The introduction of travel restrictions around the world disrupted the usual way the IDA engages with investors, resulting in fewer numbers of site visits and client meetings. The pandemic has also impacted investor confidence and has likely caused some investment decisions to be delayed or postponed.</p>  <p>  In response to COVID-19, IDA Ireland migrated many of its business development and client engagement activities onto digital platforms and has established a suite of digital content which can be accessed by potential investors.  The use of digital platforms by IDA staff has contributed to an enhanced digital engagement with existing clients and in hosting E-Site visits with potential new investors.  </p>  <p>  The number of site visits arranged by IDA, including E-visits, to end Q3 2020 was: Cavan 1; Louth 11; Meath 2 and Monaghan 1. The figures for end Q4 are expected before the end of the month.  It should also be noted that potential clients visiting Ireland may visit more than one county and may return to a location more than once. These figures represent individual visits and are therefore not indicative of the number of companies that have visited.  Enterprise Ireland did not have any site visits from overseas investors to Cavan, Louth, Meath or Monaghan in 2020. </p>  <p>  Regional development is at the centre of IDA&rsquo;s new strategy, Driving Recovery &amp;amp; Sustainable Growth 2021-2024. IDA is committed to the pursuit of more balanced, compact regional development which can deliver complementary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development. IDA will target half of all investments (400) from 2021- 2024 to regional locations and maintain the same high level of investment as targeted in IDA&rsquo;s previous strategy for each region of the country.</p></reply>

However, in discussions with ferry operators, Government also established that in the event of additional demand emerging, ferry operators would respond and increase direct services to continental Europe in line with demand.</p>  <p>  A communications campaign run by the IMDO in late 2020 asked businesses to assess their post-Brexit shipping needs and communicate their new requirements to the shipping companies. Full details of the IMDO campaign ACT (Assess, Communicate, Trial) and, and information on new routes, is available from the IMDO on the Gov.ie/Brexit website.</p>  <p>  The responsiveness of ferry operators is evident given additional capacity on direct ferry services that has now been put in place, as well as new services introduced between Ireland and continental Europe since early January.  Direct services include:  </p>  <p>  - A daily Roll on Roll off service from Ireland to Cherbourg available - with Irish Ferries and Stena Line having changed their schedules to minimise overlapping;</p>  <p>  - Stena Line put an additional ship on the Rosslare to Cherbourg route from 4 January 2021;</p>  <p>  - DFDS&rsquo;s new service from Rosslare to Dunkirk commenced on 2 January 2021 and involves six weekly departures from each port with a crossing time of 24 hours; and</p>  <p>  - CLdN added a second weekly service from Cork to Zeebrugge to cope with the increasing demand on this route.</p>  <p>  These new sailings are in addition to a number of other new services and increased sailings that came on stream last year including new Roll on Roll off services from Ireland to Zeebrugge, Santander and Portugal by CLdN.</p>  <p>  The new direct services that have been introduced to northern France, have a weekly capacity of roughly 2,500 units (standard shipping containers) when unaccompanied trailers are included. The new additional service from Cork to Zeebrugge adds approximately 300 units per week once unaccompanied trailers are included.</p>  <p>  Take up of these new services has been very strong with Rosslare Europort reporting a significant increase on freight on the direct routes to Continental Europe routes during the first week of January. Conversely, traffic on Irish Sea routes decreased.</p>  <p>  These new range of options will help businesses assess what routes are right for them and so avoid potential congestion and delays they would have experienced by using the UK Landbridge.</p></reply>

Last year as a response to COVID-19, my Department launched a new webpage dedicated to providing guidance for remote working for both employers and employees. </p>  <p>  In July 2020, my Department launched a Public Consultation on Remote Work Guidance. We received 522 submissions from employers, employees, representative bodies and special interest groups. The results of the consultation are outlined on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Based on the insights garnered from the consultation, my Department updated its guidance webpage to include new information. The guidance webpage now includes a checklist for employers considering adopting remote working arrangements in the longer term. The guidance webpage will continue to be updated regularly to act as a live resource for employers and employees.</p>  <p>  Building on this work, my Department formed an Interdepartmental Group (IDG) to steer the delivery of a national Remote Work Strategy. This Group included broad representation across government departments and state agencies. The Strategy considers what changes are needed to create an environment that is more conducive to remote work. It is expected that the Strategy will be published very shortly.</p></reply>

My colleague Minister Troy has brought this to the public&rsquo;s attention recently and reminded Irish consumers of the additional considerations, for example possible customs charges and VAT, to be aware of when purchasing from the UK.</p>  <p>  UK based retailers will have to consider the implications and assess how they can continue to offer products to Irish consumers at competitive rates and conditions. Such assessments will have to factor in pricing, profitability, administration and logistical issues. Some UK-based retailers may reconfigure their operations to have an increased physical presence in Ireland, and I am aware that some have made adaptations to how they administer charges. Some may consider the market opportunities in Ireland, in light of Brexit, to be insufficient for continued commerce with Irish consumers. These are the realities of business.</p>  <p>  The UK will continue to be a valued trading partner and a valuable source of merchandise for Irish customers. However, particular product channels enjoyed prior to Brexit may now be affected. This is the nature of the impact of Brexit. Notwithstanding this, because Ireland remains part of the largest market in the world - the EU, I have every confidence that Irish consumers can and will adapt and continue to enjoy the benefits of being in such a large and competitive market.

I am advised by NBI that, as of 21 December 2020, over 153,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.In County Roscommon there are 19,126 premises within the intervention area for the National Broadband Plan. NBI have advised that approximately 3,600 premises (around 20%) have been surveyed by 21 December including the areas of Ballymurray, Athleague, Castlecoote, Donamon, Ballymacurley, Lackan, Kilroosky and Fourmilehouse.</p><p>The premises referred to in the Question is located in the Intervention Area and surveys are planned by NBI to commence in that location by Q3 next year. I am advised that NBI is targeting the following indicative dates for further surveying in Roscommon within the next 18 months.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Roscommon Deployment Area</th>       <th>No. of Premises</th>       <th>Timelines</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Castlerea</td>       <td>4347</td>       <td>2021 Q2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Elphin</td>       <td>2483</td>       <td>2022 Q2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Curraghboy</td>       <td>1721</td>       <td>2022 Q3</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Roscommon through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. </p><p>I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.  As of 21 December, 241 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Locations in County Roscommon include Cam Community Centre (3.4kms from the premises referred to in the Question), Saint Patrick's Hall, Tawnytaskin Community Centre, Gortaganny Resource Centre and Creeve Community Centre. Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p><p>Termon National School is installed by NBI for educational access as part of this initiative and Ballagh National School is installed and connected. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise other schools with no high speed broadband, within the intervention area for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan has just  been announced which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at </p></reply>

The aim is to pool experience, offer leadership and encourage others to take action on global warming at European level. All three countries face similar challenges from climate change, and cooperation allows common solutions to be developed.   All three countries fully support the enhanced ambition at EU level to increase the EU 2030 target to at least 55% emissions reduction compared to 1990 levels and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  Ireland is one of 10 countries (including Denmark and Sweden) who signed a joint statement ahead of the European Council in December on strengthening EU climate ambition and agreeing on increasing the 2030 climate target to &ldquo;at least 55 percent&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  In December, I took part in a webinar with colleagues from Sweden and Denmark where we discussed climate neutral targets and how the respective countries are approaching climate neutrality, including an overview of types of green initiatives in response to the European Green Deal.</p>  <p>  In terms of Ireland&rsquo;s climate ambition, the Programme for Government sets out our ambition to more than halve our carbon emissions over the course of the decade. The action we take in the coming years will be critical in order to address the climate crisis, which renders our current economic model redundant and threatens our safe future on this planet. I will lead on delivering our shared commitment to achieve an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050.</p></reply>

The position of Local Government, as the level of government closest to the citizen, also puts it in an effective position to provide local leadership on climate action through its links to various community networks.</p><p>In 2018, my Department entered into a five year financial commitment of &euro;10 million to establish four Climate Action Regional Offices (CAROs), including the Dublin Metropolitan CARO.</p><p>The role of the CARO includes:</p><p>- Assisting the Local Authorities within their CARO region  in preparing their own plans to respond to climate change.</p><p>- Developing education and awareness initiatives in driving the climate change agenda and contributing to climate dialogue on a local and regional basis.</p><p>Each Local Authority in the Dublin Metropolitan CARO has developed a detailed plan outlining the actions they will take in mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change. Details can be found at: </p><p>Under the National Adaptation Framework each local authority has developed and is implementing a local adaptation strategy. Each CARO is working with its Local Authorities to both facilitate and monitor implementation of the strategies&rsquo; local climate adaptation actions.  </p><p>Under the Climate Action Plan 2019, a Climate Action Charter for Local Authorities was agreed between my Department and the Local Authorities.  The Charter will ensure that every Local Authority embeds decarbonisation, sustainable development and climate resilience into every aspect of their work. </p><p>The Climate Action Bill further strengthens the role of Local Authorities in climate action. It sets out legislative requirements for each Local Authority to produce its own Climate Action Plan (covering both mitigation and adaptation) within eighteen months of the enactment of the Bill, and then subsequently at least once every five years. </p><p>To build the necessary capacity, my Department is also engaging with the CAROs in relation to the implementation of a new Local Authority climate action training programme. This programme will increase knowledge of climate change and action among all Local Authority staff, and will facilitate both climate mitigation and adaptation at local level.</p></reply>

In order to fulfill their statutory functions in this regard, significant powers are available to Local Authorities, including the authority to:</p>  <p>  - undertake inspections of premises and vehicles being used for the sale and distribution of solid fuel;</p>  <p>  - bring prosecutions under the Air Pollution Act for breaches of the Regulations; and</p>  <p>  - issue Fixed Payment Notices ranging from &euro;250 to &euro;1,000 for alleged offences relating to the marketing, sale and distribution of prohibited fuels in Low Smoke Zones.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to further strengthen enforcement of the Regulations by developing a regional approach to air quality enforcement. A coordinated approach is required given the links between burning of solid fuels and the health effects of air pollution, as well as the potential for market distortion for businesses properly adhering to the regulations. Increased multi-agency inspections and enforcement, including the increased use of fixed payment notices, are required and my Department is fully committed to supporting Local Authorities in this regard.  </p>  <p>  Building on the success of other regional environmental enforcement models, I expect this Programme for Government commitment to be significantly progressed in the coming months.</p></reply>

I am advised by NBI that, as of December 2020, over 153,000<b></b>premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company.In County Cork there are 79,424 premises within the intervention area for the National Broadband Plan which includes premises in the locations referred  to by the Deputy. Approximately 20% of premises have been surveyed with surveys complete in Midleton, Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon and Kilpatrick. Surveys have started in Ballydesmond, Kiskeam, Umeraboy, Knocknagree, Rineen, Cullen, Coolinarna, Millstreet, Hollymount and Caherbarnagh.  </p><p>Significant build works are underway in Carrigaline, Fountainstown, Ballinhassig, Monkstown, and Upper Rochestown.  I am also advised that NBI is targeting further surveying in Cork within the next 18 months. </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. </p><p>I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.  As of 21 December, 241 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Bere Island Heritage Centre, Laharn Heritage Centre and  Ballydaly Community Hall  are BCPs which are now installed by NBI. Ballindangan Community Centre, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, Lissavard Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre and T.O.

My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise other schools with no high speed broadband, within the intervention area for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan has just  been announced which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.

Since the launch in July 2015, Eircode usage, as part of an address, continues to grow and is used widely among the public, businesses and public sector. This, in part, can be seen by use statistics of the free Eircode Finder website with almost 80 million lookups since launch in 2015 and an average daily lookup rate in November 2020 of 103,933. </p>  <p>  Eircodes are assigned to new property addresses using a valid postal address and verified geo-locations. An Post collects information on new and existing buildings, as well as changes to existing addresses and Ordnance Survey Ireland provides the geo-locations for these buildings.  An Post GeoDirectory, a subsidiary company of An Post and Ordnance Survey Ireland, issue a new release of the GeoDirectory database file on a quarterly basis to Eircode in accordance with their licence agreement. </p>  <p>  Each new postal address assigned an Eircode is published on the Eircode Finder website, a notification letter is issued to the property occupant containing the Eircode of that address and an updated Eircode Database is provided to licenced businesses for their use. Eircode have informed my Department that over 128,700 property addresses have been assigned an Eircode since the launch in 2015.</p>  <p>  Capita have informed my Department that once the Eircode database is updated they provide updates to commercial operations each quarter in line with the terms of their licence agreements. The timely release of each quarterly update is consistent across all licenced businesses, including the application referred to by the Deputy. Businesses using eircodes are obliged to abide by the terms of their licences and  to comply with any general legal obligations such as data protection.</p></reply>

This represents a &euro;47 million increase on the 2020 allocation and is the highest ever budget for this scheme.  In addition to the increased budget, capacity by the industry to deliver more activity has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works which commenced at the end of 2020. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will also be finalised shortly. </p>  <p>  There are currently over 7,000 homes on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are: currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor, or are awaiting the initial survey of their home. Eligible homes are allocated on a first come, first served basis, and the average time between application and allocation to a contractor is now 22 months.  The wait time is a result of strong demand for what is an extremely popular scheme.  Wait times were also impacted by changes to the scheme introduced in 2018 which expanded and enhanced the range of energy efficiency measures available as well as an extension of eligibility rules.  COVID-19 related restrictions have also impacted waiting times under the scheme.  Works are currently suspended in line with the public health measures in place under Level 5 as announced by Government on 6 January.  Works will recommence as soon as the public health advice allows. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that there are other grants and schemes available from Government that could assist their constituent if there is an urgent need. These include the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP) Urgent Needs Payment available through the Community Welfare Service at local DEASP offices and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government Housing Aid for Older People Grant Scheme which is administered by the Local Authorities.</p></reply>

No. 126 of 2011, sets out the grounds by which a material which is recovered or recycled from waste can be deemed to be no longer a waste. As the designated competent authority, decisions regarding applications for end-of-waste status are the responsibility of the EPA and accordingly, questions in relation to specific applications are more appropriately directed to the Agency. Further information on the end of waste process is available on the EPA&rsquo;s website at www.epa.ie.  I am very conscious of the importance of the End of Waste in the transition to a more circular economy, in particular in relation to the construction sector.  The <i>Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy</i>which I launched in September this year, has a dedicated chapter on End of Waste, and commits to a number of measures including:</p><p>- Working with stakeholders to streamline the process;</p><p>- Examining whether certain end of waste decisions should be determined by local authorities rather than the EPA;</p><p>- Establishing a working group to develop national end of waste applications for identified priority waste streams, which would obviate the need for individual applications within those streams; </p><p>- Introducing a fee for end-of-waste applications to help fund the process and encourage high quality applications.</p><p>My officials have already had initial engagement with regulatory authorities and with private sector stakeholders in relation to these measures, and will be working to advance progress in these areas over the coming months.</p></reply>

This policy statement is being developed by my Department and includes consideration of any necessary legal and regulatory provisions.

This plan will focus on utilising our existing energy and maritime infrastructure and will seek to create the right investment environment, while also supporting ocean energy research where necessary in the areas of floating wind, tidal, and wave power. </p><p>Advancements in wave energy are monitored by the SEAI at a National, European, and Global level. Currently, no wave energy technology is sufficiently developed to be successfully/commercially integrated into Ireland&rsquo;s energy generation mix. Wave energy is supported at national policy level through the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), which has provided the basis for my Department supporting technology advancement in wave energy at device, sub-system component and auxiliary service level.</p></reply>

The report, &quot;The economic and distributional impacts of an increased carbon tax with different revenue recycling schemes,&rdquo; published on 8 October 2019, found that an incremental increase in the carbon tax reaching &euro;80 per tonne in 2030, would help reduce economy-wide emissions by approximately 15% in 2030, compared to no increase in the carbon tax. </p><p>Building on this work, my Department commissioned further research in 2020 from the ESRI to examine the distributional benefits of utilising carbon tax receipts, including the impact of retrofitting on alleviating fuel poverty. As part of this programme of work, and on foot of a specific commitment in the Programme for Government, the ESRI published a report entitled, &quot;Carbon taxes, poverty and compensation options,&quot; on 13 October 2020. The report identified a series of targeted direct social protection payment interventions that could be used to address the effects an increase in the price of fossil fuels would have on lower income households and examined the effect of each of these.In addition to raising the level of carbon tax by &euro;7.50 per tonne, the Government committed, in Budget 2021, to significant increases in a targeted package of social protection supports. These supports were selected to address the impact of the increased carbon tax, as identified by the ESRI in the report referred to above. The specific measures are:</p><p>- an increase to the Qualified Child Payment of &euro;2 per week for children under 12, and &euro;5 per week for children over 12; </p><p>- an increase in the Living Alone Allowance of &euro;5 per week; and </p><p>- an increase to the Fuel Allowance of &euro;3.50 per week.</p><p>The total cost of these interventions is expected to reach an estimated &euro;153.5m in 2021. This will be part-funded by receipts from the increased carbon tax of &euro;48m, with the remaining &euro;105.5m cost to be funded by general Exchequer receipts. The analysis suggests that households in the first five income deciles will see increases in their disposable income as a result of these measures. </p><p>Further information on these is measures is available on www.budget.gov.ie.</p></reply>

This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and light.  The 2021 budget for SEAI residential and community schemes is &euro;221.5 million &ndash; the largest ever allocation for these schemes.     SEAI grants encourage homeowners to reduce heat loss through the installation of insulation and ventilation in the first instance, before moving to replace heating systems.  This is in line with the fabric first principle and best practice.  </p>  <p>  Grants for residential pellet burning heating systems are not available as an individual measure.  However, grants for pellet burning stoves are available when included as part of a wider energy efficiency upgrade under the Community Energy Grant Scheme and the National Retrofit (One-stop-shop development) Scheme.  Stoves installed must meet certain requirements and specifications.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2 and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years. Heat pumps are an attractive and extremely efficient alternative to stoves. Furthermore, heat pumps are very economical to run offering lower energy costs to homeowners as well as reduced carbon emissions. </p>  <p>  Further information on SEAI grants is available at www.seai.ie/grants or by calling 1850 927 000.</p></reply>

I note the report&rsquo;s observation that Ireland and Denmark have embraced the energy transition as a way to diversify their energy supply, and as an industrial strategy, and appear to be continuing along established trajectories towards decarbonising their electricity sectors. The report recognises the global disruption to economic and social patterns from the pandemic and highlights Ireland and Denmark as positive examples of countries continuing to decarbonise their economies while taking action to repair the damage from the Covid 19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  I believe that measures to return the Irish economy to the level of activity prior to the pandemic can also be used to promote the green transformation. The Government&rsquo;s July Stimulus Package, containing the retrofitting initiative and the Green Enterprise Fund, is one such example. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to addressing climate change and responding to the Covid-19 challenge as set out in the Programme for Government; I expect these commitments to be further addressed in the upcoming National Economic Plan and the review of the National Development Plan which is currently underway. </p></reply>

There are several public chargers in Co. Louth, including standard chargers in Dundalk, Blackrock and Drogheda amonst others  and  fast chargers at the Northbound and Southbound M1 motorway services in Castlebellingham. An interactive map showing ESB charger locations and their status can be found at <i>www.esb.ie/ecars</i>.</p><p>In addition, we have committed &euro;10 million from the Climate Action Fund to promote the charging network across Ireland and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB. This intervention alone will result in: </p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers (150kW), each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers (50kW), which may replace existing 22 kW standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers (22kW) with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>The high powered and fast chargers will be mainly concentrated on or near national roads and motorways to enable longer journeys to be completed. There has been two locations in Co Louth in which standard chargers have been replaced with fast chargers which include Bolton Square Public Car Park, Bolton Street, Drogheda and Public Car Park, Rampart Lane, Dundalk Co Louth.</p><p>More information on these upgrades can be found at .</p><p>My Department also supports the Public Charge Point Scheme which is administered through the SEAI and which will continue to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles (EVs), who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes, to charge their EVs.To date no chargers have been installed by local authorities under the scheme. The SEAI has, however, received a  completed application from Louth County Council to install 20 charge points. This application is currently being assessed for approval.</p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and to support home charging, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.</p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. According to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s latest projections, our 2020 emissions could be 2% to 4% below 2005 levels, and we will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Covid-19 will undoubtedly impact our 2020 emissions, and this is not reflected in these projections.     The EU Effort Sharing Regulation EU/2018/842 (ESR) established binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States for the period 2021 to 2030. The final agreement sets Ireland a target of 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. It is important to recognise that this target will be amended following the European Commission&rsquo;s plan to increase ambition from its existing EU wide 2030 target of 40% reduction to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by June this year, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States, including Ireland.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government, we are committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, equivalent to a 51% reduction over the decade and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, in line with EU ambitions.  </p>  <p>  As Minister for Climate Action, I will lead on delivering this ambition, which will more than halve our carbon emissions over the course of the decade. With the increased scale and depth of this ambition, new strategies will be needed to sustain a reduction trajectory that will increase over time. I am working with colleagues across Government to develop a new Climate Action Plan, with additional initiatives in every sector to bring about the significant change needed to transform our society. The Climate Action Plan will require annual revisions to address the need for intensive and regular monitoring and updating of policy actions to ensure we remain on track and within our emission limits, and will act as a further review mechanism and opportunity to adjust and refocus actions, as required.</p></reply>

The Government is committed to the rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector and will take the necessary action to deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030. </p>  <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (SEAI) published their Energy in Ireland report in December 2020, which is available at www.seai.ie.  Table 12 and Table 17 on pages 35 and 50, respectively, of the report show the breakdown of electricity generated by fuel type.  The tables give the shares of both fossil fuel and renewable energy components of electricity generated.  The share of electricity generated by renewables was 37.6% in 2019, up from 33.0% in 2018. Wind was the largest share of renewable electricity at 32% with hydro at 2.8% and other renewables including biomass at 2.7%.    </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan included a commitment to deliver at least 3.5 GW of offshore wind by 2030, up to 8.2 GW of onshore wind and up to 1.5 GW of solar; the Programme for Government commits to a further increase in offshore wind deployment to 5 GW by 2030.The National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) (Table 6 of the Plan) sets out estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology in order to achieve the overall and sectoral trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030. </p>  <p>  These technology levels are indicative and for electricity the level of each technology will be driven by technology costs and competitive auctions under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) as well as major private sector funding through Corporate Power Purchase Agreements.The results of the first RESS auction were approved by Government in September 2020, with 82 approved projects made up of  479MW of onshore wind energy projects and 796MW of solar energy projects.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and an annual reduction of 7% in overall greenhouse gas emissions to 2030, including through maximising the amount of renewable energy on the grid. Future advances in system flexibility, storage technologies including batteries and green hydrogen as well as regional and international interconnection will enable very high levels of renewable electricity on our grid.</p></reply>

As of December some 2,818 (20%) have been surveyed in the following areas; Killashee, Oughterard, Naas Rural, Rathmore, Kill, Kilteel, Carnalway, Gilltown, Ballymore Eustace, Bodenstown, Naas Urban, Newtown and Donaghcumper. Surveys will be commencing in the areas of Athy, Coneyboro, Aughaboura, Ballinapark, Castlemitchell, Bert, Kilberry and Kilkea. Further details are available on specific areas across the country including Kildare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence.</p><p>I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>Nationally, NBI has construction underway to provide access to the new fibre network to the first 19,237 premises covering townlands in Carrigaline, Cavan, Galway, Limerick and Ballinasloe.  NBI is targeting construction of the fibre network to commence in all 26 counties by the end of 2021.Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 21 December, some 241 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and will be connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. Lullymore Heritage Park and Bigstone Community Hall have now had NBI equipment installed with more locations planned over the coming months. Further details can be found at .</p><p>Rathmore National School has also had NBI equipment installed for educational access as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise other schools with no high speed broadband, within the intervention area for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan has just  been announced which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026. Further details are available on the NBI website at </p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. According to the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s latest projections, our 2020 emissions could be 2% to 4% below 2005 levels, and we will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Covid-19 will undoubtedly impact our 2020 emissions, and this is not reflected in these projections.  </p>  <p>  The EU Effort Sharing Regulation EU/2018/842 (ESR) established binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States for the period 2021 to 2030. The final agreement sets Ireland a target of 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. It is important to recognise that this target will be amended following the European Commission&rsquo;s plan to increase ambition from its existing EU wide 2030 target of 40% reduction to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. As set out in the Programme for Government, we are committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, equivalent to a 51% reduction over the decade and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, in line with EU ambitions. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Climate Action, I will lead on delivering this ambition, which will more than halve our carbon emissions over the course of the decade. With the increased scale and depth of this ambition, new strategies will be needed to sustain a reduction trajectory that will increase over time. I am working with colleagues across Government to develop a new Climate Action Plan, with additional initiatives in every sector, including transport and agriculture, to bring about the significant change needed to transform our society.</p>  <p>  By putting climate action and sustainability at the heart of our policy development, the recovery from the Covid crisis presents an opportunity to embed structural shifts that will benefit our economy and people through the adoption of green technologies and innovations. This transformation is essential to securing Ireland's economic capacity into the future in all sectors, as we move from reliance on a now redundant greenhouse gas intensive economic model.</p></reply>

Under this programme the national monitoring network has undergone a significant upgrade in recent years and has been expanded from 30 stations in 2017 to 88 by the end of 2020. All stations collect air quality data for a range of pollutants in order to provide information to the public, and for assessment against European legal limit values and World Health Organisation guideline values. </p><p>Real-time data from these monitoring stations is available online at all times at www.airquality.ie and the most recent report on Ireland&rsquo;s air quality can be found at . </p><p>Air quality in Ireland is generally good, and compares favourably with other European countries. Significant reductions in emissions have already been achieved through a range of policy measures and other developments. However, as more comprehensive, real-time, localised air quality information becomes available through the AAMP, it is apparent that there are key pollutants which still need to be addressed more comprehensively.</p><p>To this end my Department is currently working to finalise Ireland&rsquo;s first National Clean Air Strategy which I intend to publish in the coming weeks. The Strategy will provide the policy framework necessary to identify and promote the integrated measures and actions across Government that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while delivering on wider national objectives.</p></reply>

Just 7% of municipal waste was incinerated as recently as 2012. Significantly more residual waste is now used as a fuel (energy recovery) than disposed to landfill. Further information is available at </p><p>New waste management targets in the EU Landfill Directive require Member States to reduce the amount of municipal waste going to landfill to 10% or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated (by weight) by 2035. In addition, amendments to the Waste Framework Directive require that recycling rates of 55%, 60% and 65% of municipal waste (by weight) must be achieved by 2025, 2030 and 2035 respectively. </p><p>I launched a <i>Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy </i>in September 2020.<i></i>This represents a step change in our approach to waste in Ireland, as it shifts the focus away from management to a fuller reconsideration of how we use resources and materials.  The measures in the Plan are intended to minimise the amount of waste generated, eliminating waste before it can be created and diverting as much as possible to beneficial reuse or recovery and will help us deliver on our national targets.</p></reply>

In this context, both the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport &amp;amp; Media; and my Department have been liaising with the Coach Tourism &amp;amp; Transport Council of Ireland (CTTC) since early May - 11 meetings have taken place, and a further meeting is scheduled for the coming days.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the very difficult business environment that the commercial operators have been facing. Indeed, across Government we are acutely aware that the Covid-19 situation presents huge challenges for many business sectors.</p>  <p>  Public transport is a key facilitator of interaction in the economy and society. It is an efficient and sustainable way of getting people to work, education, shopping and other social engagements. The essential nature of these services has been acknowledged a number of times by the Government in recent months, most notably in the decision to provide additional funding for public service obligation, PSO, services and the introduction of temporary funding measures for the licensed bus sector. </p>  <p>  These temporary funding supports have been introduced to help ease the financial pressure on operators arising from the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenue as a result of Covid-19. They are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months and are targeted at covering the gap between specified costs and the revenues generated on the services. The supports are targeted at those classes of bus services where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention, in line with relevant state aid considerations. The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is responsible for administering the funding support through contracts with the relevant operators.</p>  <p>  These supports are in addition to the suite of other financial support measures that the Government has introduced to help mitigate the impact of Covid-19, including the pandemic unemployment payment which operators can avail of and which remains open to new applicants until the end of March 2021 and a Covid-19 enterprise support grant which can be put towards the costs associated with reopening a business, including the purchase of cleaning materials and personal protective equipment. </p>  <p>  Other measures introduced includes rates waivers, lending facilities, equity injection and business advisory supports, all of which will help to improve cash flow. The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has also set up on online tool to help support Irish start-ups and SMEs to navigate the range of Government supports and identify which support may be most relevant to their business.</p>  <p>  Concerning coach tourism - a fund of &euro;10m was made available under the July Stimulus package to assist the Coach Tourism sector. The Coach Tourism Business Continuity Scheme is administered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and is under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Catherine Martin.</p></reply>

The need to once again return to level 5 restrictions for reasons of public health will inevitably impact further on delays to driver testing. During the level 5 period, driving tests will be available only to those who are involved in essential services, including essential retail work.   </p>  <p>  While the service is limited during level 5 restrictions, the Road Safety Authority is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints with an eye to resuming wider testing after level 5. This includes increasing the number of testing staff to help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog.</p>  <p>  In this regard, I am pleased to say my Department has recently given sanction for the Road Safety Authority (RSA) to commence recruitment of 40 temporary driver testers.  These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers who I previously gave sanction to rehire during 2020. </p>  <p>  The possible extension of driving licences is currently under consideration in Europe due to Covid-19. The possible extension of learner permits is also under consideration.  Decisions on these issues are expected shortly.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) , through the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS), has expanded the online facility to accommodate all driving licence and learner permit applications to enable accessibility online rather than by calling to an office. A verified MyGovID account, which requires a Public Services Card, is needed to access the online system.</p></reply>

In 2019 about half of transport carbon emissions originated from the passenger car fleet, while the heavy and light duty freight sectors together accounted for about a further 26% of Irish land transport emissions. Public transport (bus, rail and taxi) vehicles were responsible for approximately 4.5% of transport emissions.</p>  <p>  Maximum impact in emission savings can therefore be achieved in the private car and freight sectors, by promoting a shift away from higher emitting and more polluting vehicles and fuels towards zero or low emission alternatives, and by assisting citizens to make the switch to active travel (walking and cycling). The transition of the public transport fleet (including buses, heavy rail and the taxi sector) to low-emitting technologies also plays a significant leadership and demonstration role in reducing emissions, in normalising alternative transport technologies, and in reducing air and noise pollutant emissions, particularly in Ireland&rsquo;s towns and cities. </p>  <p>  Given the complexities of the sector, and the varying maturity-levels of low emitting technologies for different vehicle types and uses, no single technology holds the key to the decarbonisation of transport. A range of technologies and strategies will be required to meet emissions reduction targets and to transition Irish transport to cleaner, more sustainable alternatives.</p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a range of instruments and strategies to assist the necessary transition of the transport sector to sustainable alternatives. Underpinning all of these is the Government&rsquo;s recognition that clean mobility strategies require technical, evidence-based and innovative solutions. As Ireland is largely a transport technology taker, my Department is also monitoring international and national developments in emerging low and zero-emission technologies, such as the potential future role of renewable hydrogen in transport, and the recent European Commission call for participation in a study on potential emission reduction through the retrofitting of existing passenger cars and vans.</p>  <p>  Given the urgency of reducing emissions from the transport sector, my Department welcomes the development and implementation of such technologies and initiatives. Where such technologies involve the modification of existing vehicles, due consideration must, of course, be given to the safety and effectiveness of any modifications. Vehicle owners or operators must also meet their legal obligation to ensure that their vehicle is maintained in a roadworthy condition, regardless of the system of propulsion or the fuel used. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department plays an important role providing start-ups with advice and support.  I also understand that a meeting between the individual concerned and officials in my Department is being arranged.</p></reply>

I think we both agree on the importance of robust tools to address uninsured drivers, who are not only acting illegally and putting a burden of cost on law-abiding drivers, but are often also drivers who are also behaving dangerously in other ways.</p>  <p>  As I have indicated before, the legislation in this area has been problematic since it was first passed in 2010.  As the project evolved it became clear that the legislation needed further amendment, which was done first in 2016, and then again in 2018.  </p>  <p>  The project has reached a point where I think we can be clear on the final legislative needs, and I have indicated that I expect this to be addressed in the forthcoming Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which I expect to publish in the New Year.  The Deputy will appreciate that this is not straightforward or simple to legislate for, touching as it does not only on road traffic law, with both domestic and EU aspects, but also the evolving regulatory environment for personal data and requiring the use of both State and privately-held records.  I look forward to seeing the database fully operational.  It will, as the Deputy says, provide a valuable tool for the Garda in addressing uninsured driving, will make our roads safer, and also I hope bring down insurance costs for the honest regular driver.   </p></reply>

I am particularly pleased that these improved bus services ensure greater connectivity between the northern and southern sides of the town and, importantly, provide much improved connections to the town&rsquo;s train station, and mean the town now has a real network emerging of public transport services.

The RSA has begun the recruitment process with the Public Appointments Service.  </p>  <p>  These new hires will be in addition to the 36 temporary testers who I previously gave sanction to rehire during 2020. </p>  <p>  These measures will help to increase testing capacity.  However, I would like to stress, that many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p>  <p>  The RSA are also looking at a number of other measures, including whether the number of tests a driver tester can perform each day can be increased. Any decision on this matter will be guided by health protocols. </p>  <p>  The Department has been in discussions with the RSA on how to return to the normal target for the maximum waiting time, which is around ten weeks.  It is clear that it will not be possible to arrive at this quickly, given restraints which must be in place due to the pandemic.  It is important to recognise that there are no quick fixes and that the continuing build-up of applications as the pandemic goes on means that it will take time to reach a normal waiting time.  </p>  <p>  Covid-19 has also had a profound effect on the delivery of the Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s driver theory testing services and a significant backlog has developed.   Under current level 5 restrictions, the driver theory test has not been deemed to be an essential service. As a consequence, the service is closed while level 5 restrictions remain in place.  </p>  <p>  The driver theory test service has seen its capacity reduced significantly to comply with occupational and public health requirements. The Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with its service provider to maximise capacity to offer tests while adhering to occupational and public health requirements for when servicers are resumed. In this regard, they would, for example, be opening on additional days at some centres and extended hours also provided to allow additional capacity for appointments. Much like the driver testing service, it will take time for the theory test service to return to normal waiting times.</p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused by the necessity to adhere to the restrictions, the safety of the public must be of paramount importance.</p></reply>

This type of long-term, evidence-based, strategic planning framework is in line with international best practice and one I very much welcome.  An expanded and improved bus system, such as that proposed under the BusConnects programme, forms an important part of the Transport Strategy;  I welcome the ongoing consultation by the NTA in relation to the review of the Strategy, and I see that process as complementing the work already underway in improving people's quality of life through the availability of better infrastructure and services for public tranpsort and active travel.     </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific questions around expenditure to date and the public consultation process, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for their consideration and direct reply in light of their statutory responsibilities for the programme.  Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days.</p></reply>

There are six weekly departures from each port with a crossing time of 24 hours and capacity for up to 125 HGVs; and</p>  <p>  - CldN added a second weekly call from Cork to Zeebrugge to cope with the increasing demand on this route. </p>  <p>  The additional services introduced to northern France, which include the Stena Foreteller to Cherbourg and the DFDS/EURoRo service to Dunkirk, adds a further weekly capacity of roughly 2,500 units when unaccompanied trailers are included. There is also a new additional service from Cork to Zeebrugge supplied by CLdN which adds approximately 300 units per week once unaccompanied trailers are included.  </p>  <p>  Such actions reinforce the IMDO Report findings late last year about the willingness and ability of the shipping sector to adjust and respond to market demand. </p>  <p>  Since 1 January, in light of the difficulties being experienced by businesses and hauliers with regard to the new customs procedures, my Department have been in contact with the shipping companies on a daily basis to monitor the situation with the assistance of the IMDO.</p>  <p>  I also met with the shipping companies last week to hear first hand their concerns about the current situation regarding the difficulties being experienced by businesses with the new customs procedures and the impact on shipping services and to assist in resolving those problems where possible.   </p>  <p>  Given the level of difficulties being encountered, we are also encouraging the relevant shipping companies to ensure that the services they have in place align with the changing demands of industry, albeit that this demand may be transient as businesses become familiar with the customs procedures into and out of GB and exceptionally low volumes return to normal on Ireland/GB routes.  </p>  <p>  Some shipping companies have already responded with some temporary moves to address the situation, including Irish Ferries moving its largest ship, the WB Yeats, on to its Dublin to Cherbourg service and Stena supplementing its services this weekend, when demand is at its peak.  The companies are currently assessing what further options are available on a temporary basis to increase capacity on these routes. </p>  <p>  Based on current assessment, there is shipping capacity on the continental corridor from Dublin and Rosslare with the additional capacity coming on stream this weekend.  However, it is acknowledged that capacity for accompanied freight is under pressure and options to alleviate this pinch point are being reviewed across the system.   </p>  <p>  I would encourage the ferry companies, haulage operators and businesses to work together, with Departments and Government agencies, to ensure the maintenance of the supply chain as the new customs requirements are bedded down.   This requires all parties to review the various options available across all modes of transport. </p></reply>

However, if a vehicle is subsequently required to be put back on the road, the declaration can be broken at any time simply by taxing the vehicle.</p>  <p>  Where a declaration is not made in advance, arrears of motor tax, if applicable, must be paid in full and motor tax paid for a minimum of 3 months before a declaration of non-use can then be made in the final month of the tax disc.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans to re-introduce retrospective declarations of non-use or to otherwise provide for the waiving of arrears of motor tax.</p></reply>

As a consequence, the service is closed while level 5 restrictions remain in place.  </p>  <p>  The driver theory test service has seen its capacity reduced significantly to comply with occupational and public health requirements. The Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with its service provider to maximise capacity to offer tests while adhering to occupational and public health requirements for when servicers are resumed. In this regard, they would, for example, be opening on additional days at some centres and extended hours also provided to allow additional capacity for appointments.</p>  <p>  My Department had previously requested that the Road Safety Authority, as the body legally responsible for the driver theory test, examine whether theory tests can be taken on line remotely and what is required to do so.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform you that the Driver Theory Test service has launched a pilot phase of a new initiative, which offers a Remote Testing service for specific categories of Theory Test (bus and truck, ADI and CPC).</p>  <p>  During the pilot phase Remote Testing will be available on a limited basis and extra capacity will be added as it is rolled out to allow more customers to sit their bus, truck, CPC or ADI Theory Test online. Remote Testing allows candidates to test from their home or another suitable environment once the minimum requirements for the service have been met.  </p>  <p>  Following a review of the pilot phase, the RSA expect the initiative to be extended for car and motorcycles in the future.</p></reply>

To fulfil this requirement, every road transport undertaking in Ireland (or in any other EU Member State) must have a nominated Transport Manager who resides in the EU to effectively and continuously manage its transport activities. The Transport Manager must hold a Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC), in either Road Haulage or Road Passenger Transport depending on the nature of the operator's business. This certificate must be issued by an EU Member State and is ordinarily obtained by passing a written examination. </p>  <p>  As highlighted by the European Commission in 2018, and more recently in July 2020, with the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020, Transport Manager CPCs issued by an authority of the United Kingdom or a body authorised by the United Kingdom are no longer valid in the EU. </p>  <p>  As part of the Government's Brexit preparations, my Department carried out a review and identified approximately 200 individuals with a UK-issued Transport Manager CPC nominated as Transport Manager for Irish road transport operators. This Department (rather than the RSA) wrote to these Transport Managers and the relevant operators to ensure that they were aware of the position as outlined by the European Commission.  </p>  <p>  My Department liaised with the European Commission on this matter and received clarification at the end of November 2020 that a corresponding Irish Transport Manager CPC could be issued to those UK-qualified individuals working for Irish operators, before the end of the Brexit transition period. </p>  <p>  In view of this clarification, my Department established arrangements with the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) for the application process to obtain a corresponding Irish Transport Manager CPC.  CILT is the body that issues Transport Manager CPCs in Ireland on behalf of the Department of Transport. A further communication issued at the start of December 2020 to affected Transport Managers to outline how to apply for an Irish Transport Manager CPC.  This means that such Transport Managers making the necessary application before the end of the Brexit transition period are not required to undertake an Irish examination in order to continue to work as Transport Manager for an Irish or other EU operator.  It is important to note that, in line with the Commission&rsquo;s clarification, applications were to be submitted to CILT by 31 December 2020, as after that date it is not possible to obtain an Irish Transport Manager CPC on the basis of holding a UK certificate. The Department emphasised this clearly in its communications to affected Transport Managers. This position was also outlined to the Deputy on 1 December, in the recent reply to PQ number 40449/20. </p></reply>

Continued operation of the public transport sector is important, and it has been designated among the essential services that have carried on during the Covid crisis.  I would like to thank both public and commercial operators and their staff for providing this vital service in such challenging times.  </p>  <p>  The Government's "Living with Covid" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the Plan.   At the current Levels 5, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's guidance on working from home where possible and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.  There is continued strong messaging that public transport capacity remains restricted and, therefore, should only be used for essential travel, with only those who have to travel at peak times doing so.  People are being encouraged to walk or cycle where practical. The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most and in particular frontline workers.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have been introduced across the system, guided by public health advice, to ensure the continued operation of services during the pandemic, and to help protect the safety of passengers and staff, including enhanced cleaning regimes, the wearing of face coverings and social distancing measures across the network. My Department is engaging directly with the National Transport Authority (NTA) in relation to these measures and the NTA is coordinating the response of public transport operators.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

The need to once again return to level 5 restrictions for reasons of public health will inevitably impact further on delays to driver testing. During the level 5 period, driving tests will be available only to those who are involved in essential services, including essential retail work.   </p>  <p>  While the service is limited during level 5 restrictions, the Road Safety Authority is examining ways of increasing the number of tests within health constraints with an eye to resuming wider testing after level 5.

Since services resumed, there has inevitably been an increased level of demand due to the consequent backlog. </p><p>All appointments must be booked in advance as it is not possible to facilitate any walk-ins due to the social distancing requirements and in the interest of protecting the staff and customers. This, of course, has led to an increase in the demand for appointments.</p><p>Under Covid-19 Level 5 Government restrictions, applicants can attend an appointment at an NDLS centre provided they are an essential worker involved in the provision of essential services or essential retail outlets. Details on what is included in the list of essential workers and retail outlets is available on .</p><p>The RSA is working with their providers to see how they can create the additional capacity needed as quickly as possible, while adhering to the return to work protocol for when normal service resumes after level 5. Options being introduced include a combination of additional staff, extended and additional operating hours (i.e. Sundays where needed), and the provision of overtime.</p><p>The National Driver Licence Service (NDLS), has expanded the online facility to accommodate all driving licence and learner permit applications to enable accessibility online rather than by calling to an office. A verified MyGovID account, which requires a Public Services Card, is needed to access the online system.</p><p>The possible extension of driving licences is currently under consideration in Europe due to Covid-19. The extension of learner permits is also under consideration. A decision is expected shortly.</p><p>All persons of 70 years of age and over will now be invited to renew their driving licence or learner permit by post. Applicants will be contacted directly by the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS). Previously only those aged 70 and over who renew their licence on a yearly basis could avail of this service. </p><p>They do not need to contact the NDLS directly about their application. All those 70 years and over who have previously presented at an NDLS centre in the last 5 years and whose licence or permit is due to expire will receive a renewal pack in the post and be invited to apply by post. Although this is a temporary measure due to the Covid-19 pandemic, no end date has been applied to this provision at this time.</p><p>In light of the resurgence of Covid-19 cases and, in order to ease the burden on medical services, my Department has extended the exemption that allows for those aged over 70 to apply for a driving licence without the need to provide a medical report until 30 June 2021 unless they have an identified or specified illness. A previous exemption had been in place until 31 December 2020.</p></reply>

In this context the 2020 Programme for Government has committed to review and reduce speed limits, where appropriate, to address both road safety issues and carbon emissions, and ensure greater compliance.</p>  <p>  Ireland's road network is extensive and inconsistent, which means that a 'one size fits all' solution for Speed Limits for the 100,000 kilometre road network is not always possible and queries will arise.

The implementation of the Action Plan will be overseen by the Sub-Group on Insurance Reform within the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment.  The Action Plan includes actions to be brought forward by my Department, as well as the Departments of Justice and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, over the next 18 months. </p>  <p>  Some of the key measures under the Action Plan are as follows:</p>  <p>  - increasing market transparency following the publication of the second private motor report of the National Claims Information Database (NCID), and the planned expansion of the scope of the NCID to include employer and public liability insurance;</p>  <p>  - reviewing the duty of care legislation;</p>  <p>  - providing for the Judicial Council's accelerated adoption by 31 July 2021 of new personal injuries guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum;</p>  <p>  - consideration by the Department of Justice of the Law Reform Commission's recent Report on Capping Damages in Personal Injuries Actions;</p>  <p>  - looking at how to further enhance the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; and,</p>  <p>  - making proposals on insurance competition via the recently-established Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market.</p>  <p>  It might also be of interest to the Deputy to note that, in addition to this work, there was a round of intensive engagement with key stakeholders in relation to the Government's insurance reform agenda. In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has held meetings with the Alliance for Insurance Reform; the State Claims Agency; Insurance Ireland; Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance; the Central Bank of Ireland; Brokers Ireland; the Law Society of Ireland; the Bar Council of Ireland; and the MIBI.  More recently, he has also concluded a series of meetings with the main insurers in the Irish market and he has written to the CEOs of the main insurance companies operating in the Irish market seeking their views on a range of issues. The Deputy can be assured that there will continue to be engagement with these various stakeholders throughout 2021.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key priority issue for this Government.  It is my intention, along with Minister of State Fleming, to work to ensure that these commitments are progressed within the timeframes envisaged in the Action Plan.  In this regard, we will work with our Government colleagues to ensure that a Whole-of-Government approach continues to be the focus and that the cumulative impact of all of the actions in the Action Plan can have a positive effect on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses and voluntary groups across Ireland.</p></reply>

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan. </p><p>Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website at: .</p><p>To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to purchase goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &quot;business premises&quot; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on. </p><p>Where a business does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises, such as a haulage business that ordinarily operates from mobile vehicles, that business will not meet the eligibility criteria for CRSS. Similarly, a business such as a photographer or videographer that provides its services at events, including weddings, at different venues will not meet the eligibility criteria. </p><p>I have also previously indicated that an on-course bookmaker operating from a mobile premises or a premises not permanently fixed in place, such as a stand at a racecourse, is not operating from a business premises for the purposes of CRSS and therefore is not eligible to make a claim under the scheme. The Deputies will also appreciate that outdoor activity businesses, by their very nature, generally do not provide services in premises to which access is restricted. Therefore, they are not eligible for the CRSS and I have no plans to change this. In the same way, camping and caravan operations are not eligible for the CRSS. </p><p>It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or restrict access to its business premises.</p><p>The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions. Businesses who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p><p>The purpose of the CRSS is to provide additional support to the businesses who have had to close temporarily or significantly restrict access to their premises as a direct result of public health Regulations.  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects.</p></reply>

Furthermore, I must always be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base.</p><p>Proposals for tax expenditure measures should be assessed in accordance with my department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines.  Drawing on economic evidence, these make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances where there are demonstrable market failures and where a tax-based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p><p>The proposal for a domestic retrofit tax incentive was explored by my officials in a Tax Strategy Group paper on Climate Action and Tax, published in July 2019 (available at ).</p><p>The paper observed that:</p><p>- In terms of current direct expenditure measures in the energy efficiency sector, the Government continues to make grants available to householders who wish to improve the energy efficiency of their home through the SEAI's Better Energy Homes (BEH) and Deep retrofit Grant programme.</p><p>- Recent research undertaken by the ESRI into householder preferences regarding retrofit subsidy schemes found that households strongly prefer cash payment subsidies (i.e. up-front discounts or cash back post works) versus other indirect methods of financial support (e.g. tax credits). </p><p>- From an equity perspective, tax expenditure measures can be regressive by nature, given that only those who pay taxes qualify, and those with greatest income benefit the most. As such, a tax incentive measure as proposed may be of little benefit to certain groups who are most likely to suffer from energy poverty, for example the elderly or those on limited incomes. </p><p>- The Home Renovation Incentive (the tax measure on which the proposal was based) expired on 31 December 2018 following an ex-post analysis of the scheme. The review found that in the context of the current housing supply shortage, and the need at that time to deliver 25,000 additional housing units per annum over the period 2017-2021, there was a risk that the retrofit scheme could lead to increased competition for scarce resources within the construction sector, leading to upward pressure on construction costs and house prices. The review concluded that the potential for displacement of labour from work on new builds to work on home renovations would create a high opportunity cost of labour associated with HRI which was not present at the inception of the scheme. Given the continued constraints on the construction sector's ability to hire labour to deliver a supply of new housing units, similar issues may arise with regard to the introduction of this proposed tax based measure.</p><p>Having regard to these considerations, the case for introducing a tax measure along the lines mentioned by the Deputy is not a strong one from the perspective of my Department.</p></reply>

As such, it is not possible to identify the extent to which tax relief under the scheme may have supported qualifying work within any one local authority area, including the area within the remit of the council mentioned by the Deputy. </p><p>There are three types of relief available:</p><p>- Owner-occupier residential relief;</p><p>- Rented residential relief; and,</p><p>- Commercial/Retail relief. </p><p>The following table outlines the cost/uptake for all 3 elements combined of the scheme nationally between 2013 and 2018 (the most recent year for which data are available). <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>No. of claimants</th>       <th>Max Tax Cost (&euro;M)*</th>       <th>Amount claimed (&euro;M)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>0.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>0.1</td>       <td>0.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>0.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>0.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2014</td>       <td>N/A</td>       <td>0.1</td>       <td>0.2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2013</td>       <td>N/A</td>       <td>0.05</td>       <td>0.1</td>    </tr> </table> *assumed at 40% for IT and 12.5% for CT</p><p>The special regeneration areas for the Living City Initiative were designated following consultation with the relevant city councils and an independent review by a third party advisor. Specific criteria were set down in respect of the areas which should be included within the remit of the LCI which were required to be taken into account by the relevant city councils when putting forward the proposed Special Regeneration Areas for each city. In particular, it was stated that the Special Regeneration Areas should be inner city areas which are largely comprised of dwellings built before 1915, where there is above average unemployment and which demonstrate clear evidence of neglect, dereliction and under-use. It was specified that areas which are generally regarded as affluent, have high occupancy rates and which do not require regeneration should not be included in the Special Regeneration Areas. I have no plans at present to amend the zones. </p><p>Officials in my Department reviewed the Living City Initiative in 2016 in consultation with the relevant councils and the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. On foot of that review, a number of changes were brought forward to the scheme in Budget 2017 in order to make the initiative more attractive and effective. The principal change extended the residential element of the scheme to landlords, who are now able to claim the relief by way of accelerated capital allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of property, which was built prior to 1915, where such property is to be used for residential purposes. In addition, the requirement for a pre-1915 building to have been originally constructed for use as a dwelling in order to qualify for the residential element of the Initiative was removed. The floor area restriction for owner-occupiers has also been removed, while the minimum amount of capital expenditure required for eligibility for relief, under all elements of the scheme, was also amended and must now only exceed &euro;5,000. </p><p>The aim is to get the design of the Initiative right so that it can work in an effective manner. Once it is clear that this have been achieved, it will then be possible to consider if and how the Initiative might be extended to other locations. Unless the underpinning scheme is made more effective, extension of eligibility for it to other towns is likely to be largely ineffective.</p></reply>

An example of this is that routine dental treatment does not attract the relief, though orthodontic treatment would. </p>  <p>  Consistent with this rationale, tax relief in respect of qualifying health expenses is provided for in section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  </p>  <p>  Routine dental treatment is explicitly excluded under the legislation and is defined as "the extraction, scaling and filling of teeth and the provision and repairing of artificial teeth or dentures".</p>  <p>  However, an individual can claim tax relief in respect of non-routine dental care provided by a registered practitioner.  A comprehensive and indeed non-exhaustive list of relevant procedures is available on the Revenue website.  This list includes major interventions such as periodontal treatment for gum disease and orthodontic treatment to provide braces. </p>  <p>  The exclusion of expenses incurred in respect of routine dental treatment has been in place since the relief's inception in 1967 and I am satisfied that the legislation as drafted and implemented provides sufficient flexibility for expenses that should qualify.  There are no plans to change these arrangements at this time.  </p>  <p>  In this regard I note that tax relief for medical expenses is a commonly availed of relief &ndash; the most data from 2018 highlights that 522,800 taxpayer units utilised the relief at an Exchequer cost of &euro;156m.</p>  <p>  If routine dental expenses, such as dentures, were tax relieved, it would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments to similarly qualify for relief.  This could greatly increase the overall cost of the tax relief and given the current challenging fiscal environment, I am not predisposed to such a potential cost increase. </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy will be aware that in recent years there has been an increase in the level of dental benefits available through the social insurance system administered by the Department of Social Protection.  In this regard it is noted that tax relief is only of assistance to individuals who have sufficient tax liability and so direct expenditure may be a more effective way of targeting assistance to those who may need a specific support.</p></reply>

Secured properties remain in the ownership and control of their registered owners, or appointed receivers where applicable. These parties also manage the sales process.</p>  <p>  As regards the property referenced by the Deputy, I am advised that the property was openly marketed and sold by the appointed receiver in 2013. Once a property has been sold, NAMA has no further involvement. </p>  <p>  By virtue of sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act, NAMA is precluded from disclosing the name of the purchaser of the asset, however NAMA has confirmed to me that the purchaser was not the individual referenced by the Deputy. Additionally, NAMA confirms that, at the time of the sale, NAMA obtained written confirmations from the purchaser of the property which confirmed that, among other things, the purchaser was not a party precluded from completing the purchase by virtue of section 172(3) of the NAMA Act. </p>  <p>  Section 172(3) is a legal provision that prevents assets held as security for loans acquired by NAMA from being sold back to defaulting debtors, or persons acting on behalf of defaulting debtors. Additionally, under section 7(2) of the NAMA Act, any person who intentionally, recklessly or through gross negligence provides false or inaccurate information to NAMA commits a crime.</p>  <p>  On the basis of the information provided by NAMA regarding this transaction, I am satisfied that the asset disposal was compliant with section 172 of the NAMA Act.</p></reply>

In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within Annex III of the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply either one or two reduced rates of VAT. Ireland, in line with the VAT Directive, also maintains several standstill provisions and derogations that allows it to maintain reduced rates, zero rates and exemptions to certain supplies for historical reasons. These standstill provisions and derogations cannot be extended. </p>  <p>  In accordance with one such standstill provision, white (including off-white and cream) cylindrical candles and night-lights are zero rated for VAT purposes. Other candles and night-lights, such as those that are decorated, spiralled, tapered or perfumed, are liable to VAT at the standard rate.</p>  <p>  I introduced an amendment in Finance Bill 2020 to remove the application of the zero rate of VAT to a category of candles which will consequently provide for the taxation of all candles at the standard rate of VAT, currently 21%. Following discussions at Committee Stage of the Bill and having received numerous representations, I decided on a later date for implementing this change on the basis that this will allow the parties involved to amend their pricing and contracts which would already have been set based on the zero rate of VAT.  The proposed amendment will come into effect on the 1 January 2022.</p></reply>

At present customers can expect to wait between 6 and 20 working days for a pre-registration appointment; the 20 day wait occurs in two NCTS centres. </p><p>The service provider has also increased its pre-inspection service for cars held by authorised motor dealers &ndash; details are at the following links: <i>and </i>.  The registration service offered to authorised dealers on the Revenue Online Service (ROS) for new cars and cars that have been pre-inspected has remained unchanged since the original restrictions in March and such vehicles may be registered in the normal way before delivery to a customer.</p><p>Overall, Revenue is satisfied that the service being provided at present is reasonable in the context of the safety protocols that are necessary in NCTS Centres.</p></reply>

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. </p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income. </p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p>  <p>  I have also been advised by Revenue that, from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.</p>  <p>  The question as to how cohabiting couple are treated for the purposes of social welfare payments is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

The regulations include a requirement on Moneylenders to include prominent, high cost warnings in all advertisements for moneylending loans with an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) over 23 per cent. The warning must also prompt consumers to consider alternatives. The regulations came into effect on 1 January 2021. However, recognising the financial effects of COVID-19 on consumers, the &lsquo;high-cost warning&rsquo; requirement in respect of advertisements for moneylending loans with an APR in excess of 23% came into effect on 1 September 2020.</p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is available to anyone experiencing problems with budgeting and debt. Furthermore, I would encourage anyone who is in receipt of a social welfare payment to explore the option of a Personal Micro Credit Scheme Loan. These loans are branded as the &lsquo;It Makes Sense Loan&rsquo; and are offered through the credit union network. 108 credit unions and 173 sub-offices (281 locations in total) are now in a position to offer the &lsquo;It Makes Sense Loan&rsquo;.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation.  The incentive is scheduled to operate until the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  HTB is designed to stimulate the supply of new houses in the housing market and to assist first time buyers in accumulating a deposit for a new home. In order to help further meet these goals, I announced an enhancement to the existing scheme with effect from 23 July last for the remainder of 2020 as part of the July Stimulus Package. The legislation to give effect to this is set out in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020. The Finance Act 2020 further extended the period of application of the enhanced levels of support until 31 December 2021.</p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. The HTB scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for affordable new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. A move to include second-hand properties within the scope of the relief would not improve the effectiveness of the relief; on the contrary it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply. </p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend HTB to second-hand properties.</p></reply>

In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were on the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.  Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19.  Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit.  For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.  Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.</p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for mortgage credit remains a commercial matter for the individual lender.  Nevertheless, the Central Bank has indicated that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated firm is dealing with them in relation to an application for credit, or they believe that the regulated firm is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated firm.  If the mortgage applicant is still not satisfied with the response from the regulated firm, he or she can refer the complaint to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. </p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. </p><p>Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme. A claimant under the scheme must make an application confirming s/he meets various conditions specified in the section, including that s/he is a first-time purchaser and that he or she has completed a tax return form and is tax compliant for each of the tax years for which a claim is being made.</p><p>In particular, the legislation provides that where applicants: </p><p>(i) enter into a contract for the purchase of a new house or apartment, or </p><p>(ii) make the first draw down of the mortgage in the case of a self-build property,</p><p>during the qualifying period of 19 July 2016 to 31 December 2021, they may avail of the HTB scheme, subject to all other conditions being satisfied. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that, based on the details provided, as the first tranche of the mortgage for the self-build property was drawn down before the commencement of the qualifying period 19 July 2016 (i.e. drawn down in May 2016), HTB relief would not be available as the conditions of the scheme are not satisfied.  As with all time bound reliefs, there will always be those who just miss out on qualification as is the case unfortunately in the current instance. </p></reply>

It commenced on 1 October 2020. The tax credit is worth a maximum of &euro;125, or &euro;250 for a jointly assessed couple. </p>  <p>  The scheme is due to operate until 30 April next year but the flexibility exists for me to extend its operation in 2021 beyond that date. However, it is too early as yet to take any decisions in that regard. Much will depend on how matters unfold in the weeks and months ahead. As I have said previously, I will be monitoring the scheme, to see how it&rsquo;s working and if any changes need to be made. We need to keep policies that are working, and change ones that might not be working as planned, but at all times, ensuring they are affordable.</p>  <p>  It is important also to recall that the scheme should not be viewed in isolation from the other measures put in place to support businesses generally and the hospitality sector in particular. The VAT change; the rates waiver; the extension of the wage support scheme until next year and its extension to new or seasonal staff; and other Government measures all play a part in helping the sector cope with the challenges it faces.</p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. The implementation of this voluntary moratorium by the banking industry was a flexible response to the emerging COVID-19 crisis and ensured that a large volume of affected customers could benefit quickly during a fast moving and evolving public health crisis.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that borrowers whose payment break ended were given an option to return to full repayments based on the same term of the loan or to extend the term of the loan or to engage further with their bank on suitable arrangements. On 30 November last, the BPFI reported that approximately 49% of SMEs returned to repaying on the existing term whilst 46% returned to repaying on extended term basis and just over 5% returned on reduced repayments. </p><p>On the question of whether new payment breaks can be put in place, the Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance.  The BPFI has also reiterated in recent days that standard payment breaks continue to be part of the wide range of tailored solutions which are being made available to customers upon assessment of their situation.</p><p>SME-borrowers have regulatory protections via the Central Bank's SME lending regulations. The SME Regulations set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities in relation to various aspects of business lending. This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security or collateral, credit refusals and withdrawals, handling complaints, managing arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty. The options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short-term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.</p><p>In addition, Credit Review was established to assist those SMEs and farm borrowers that have had credit applications of up to &euro;3 million refused or indeed an existing credit facility withdrawn or amended by the participating bank. SMEs can apply to Credit Review after exhausting the internal appeals process in the participating institution, which are currently AIB, BOI, Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB.</p><p>Through ongoing engagement with the BPFI and lenders, the Central Bank is working to ensure that borrowers affected by COVID-19 continue to be supported through this period of unprecedented stress. The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements. The Central Bank&rsquo;s clear expectation is that lenders engage effectively and sympathetically with distressed borrowers. </p><p>It should be noted that the Central Credit Register does not produce credit scores; rather the information on a credit report provided by the Central Credit Register is factual in nature and the information is provided to the Central Credit Register by lenders. It contains no guidance, recommendation or prohibition for lenders on what decision they should make on an application for credit or repayment arrangements agreed with borrowers. Subject to complying with applicable law and regulatory requirements, it is a matter for lenders to make their own lending decisions in accordance with their own credit policies and risk appetites. </p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support. </p></reply>

The Central Bank recently wrote to all lenders indicating that lenders are to ensure that they have sufficient expert resources to assess individual borrower circumstances, and to offer appropriate and sustainable solutions to affected borrowers in a timely manner in line with regulatory requirements and Central Bank expectations. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection and other applicable frameworks will be fully available to all borrowers that will still need support.</p></reply>

Section 33(2) sets out the following measures that shall be applied by designated persons (which include banks and credit unions):</p>  <p>  &ldquo;(a) identifying the customer, and verifying the customer's identity on the basis of documents (whether or not in electronic form), or information, that the designated person has reasonable grounds to believe can be relied upon to confirm the identity of the customer, including -</p>  <p>  (i) documents from a government source (whether or not a State government source), or </p>  <p>  (ii) any prescribed class of documents, or any prescribed combination of classes of documents;&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Act is not overly prescriptive as to what documentation and information a designated person must obtain, or the methods by which such documentation and information should be gathered, in order to comply with its customer due diligence obligations. The Central Bank, which is the supervisor of banks for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (&ldquo;AML/CFT&rdquo;) purposes, also does not prescribe which documents or information may be accepted by a credit institution in compliance with the Act.  This reflects the risk based approach to AML compliance and supervision which is enshrined in EU law, and which allows a credit institution to decide which documents or information it will accept to identity and verify a customer, having first assessed the risks posed to the credit institution in accepting such person as a customer. </p>  <p>  In relation to applications for credit, the Credit Reporting Act 2013 requires credit information providers (which also includes banks and credit unions) to verify the identity of credit information subjects for the purposes of accurately accessing the central credit register. The information which may be legally requested for this purpose is set out in regulations under that Act and it includes documentation which will verify the person's name and date of birth, address and PPSN. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the Minister for Social protection that the legal basis of the PPS number is set out in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005. This legislation provides for the allocation, use and sharing of the PPS number.  The PPS number remains a restricted number which can only be used by certain specified bodies and only for the purposes of public service transactions.</p>  <p>  It is an offence for any person or body to request or hold a record of a PPS number unless they are legally entitled to so. Therefore it is the duty of all bodies to ensure that they are legally entitled to do so, before they request or hold a record of any person's PPS Number.</p>  <p>  More generally, the provisions of data protection legislation, including the GDPR, will apply and banks and other financial institutions like all other relevant data controllers will also have to comply with these provisions.</p></reply>

The published information includes the numbers of employers and employees supported through the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) during 2020. </p><p>For 2020, the number of employers and employees supported by the TWSS were 66,600 and 664,500. The number of employers and employees supported by the EWSS in 2020 were 39,800 and 443,100 respectively. </p><p>Revenue also publishes weekly updates (since March 2020) with further detail on the operation of the COVID-19 support schemes including TWSS, EWSS and the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), which are available at: .</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it is not yet possible to calculate the exact amount of tax and USC owed by employees on both the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (in the case of the PUP, the liability relates to income tax only; no USC liability arises). However, Revenue has advised me that it expects to publish preliminary statistics in the coming days, setting out provisional figures. </p><p>Revenue has also advised me that it will make 2020 <i>Preliminary End of Year Statements</i>available to all employees from 15 January 2021. This Statement will provide employees with a preliminary calculation of their income tax and USC position for 2020 and will indicate whether their tax for the year is balanced, underpaid or overpaid. At that point, employees will be able to claim any additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses, to arrive at their final liability for 2020. </p><p>Revenue has assured me that where underpayments still exist after the allocation of all available tax credits for 2020, it will take a very pragmatic approach to collecting these arrears. For example, where it is not possible for a taxpayer to pay the arrears up-front, it will be automatically collected over four years from January 2022 (interest free) by reducing the person&rsquo;s future tax credits.</p></reply>

These reviews generally include analysis of tax return data, information sourced during outdoor compliance work and information received from 3<sup>rd</sup>party sources. Where risks are identified, Revenue follows up with the taxpayer or with any relevant agency as necessary.  </p><p>The risk identified in the case in question arose from enquiries by one of Revenue&rsquo;s outdoor teams (Shadow Economy) and the person&rsquo;s case was subsequently referred to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal to confirm that he was correctly entitled to a Primary Medical Certificate, which is a qualifying condition of the scheme.

In early December 2020, and as the public health restriction at the time began to ease and businesses reopen, Revenue confirmed that the concessionary measure related to employer-provided vehicles would cease to apply on 31 December 2020 and, with effect from 1 January 2021, BIK on same should be calculated in the usual manner.  </p><p>However, since then, Level 5 public health restrictions have been subsequently introduced. On 24 December 2020, all restaurants, caf&eacute;s and gastro pubs as well as personal services, such as hairdressers, beauticians and barbers closed, while hotels, guesthouses and B&amp;amp;Bs remain open but are restricted to essential non-social and non-tourist services only. Additionally, on 31 December all non-essential retail as well as gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools closed. For employees, the public health advice is to work from home in all instances unless work is an essential health, social care or other essential service that cannot be done from home. </p><p>Having regard to the current public health restrictions, the short-term concessionary measures announced back in March will remain in place. This means that, for the time being:  </p><p>- Where an employer takes back possession of the vehicle and an employee has no access to the vehicle, no BIK shall apply for the period. </p><p>- Where an employee retains possession of a vehicle, but the employer prohibits the use of the vehicle, no BIK shall apply if the vehicle is not used for private use.  </p><p>- Records should be maintained to show that the employer has prohibited its use and no such use has occurred, for example communication from employer, photographic evidence of odometer, etc.</p><p>- Where an employee has a car provided by his or her employer and </p><p>1. the circumstances in the previous example don&rsquo;t apply,</p><p>2. limited or reduced business mileage (if any) is undertaken due to the COVID-19 crisis, and</p><p>3. personal use is limited</p><p>the amount of business mileage travelled in January 2020 may be used as a base month for the purposes of calculating the amount of BIK due. Thus, the percentage applied in the calculation of the cash equivalent, which is based on annualised business mileage, may have regard to the actual business mileage for January 2020, for the current period of the COVID-19 restrictions. Appropriate records should be kept, for example business mileage travelled in January, amount of private use, photographic evidence of odometer etc. </p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s website will shortly be updated accordingly. </p><p>Due to the nature of the Covid-19 pandemic it is not known how long any COVID-19 restrictions will ultimately remain in place. Revenue will however continue to regularly review all COVID-19 related matters (including the provisions relating to BIK on employer-provided vehicles) and if any further measures are considered necessary in the future, updated guidance will be made available by Revenue in relation to same as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The EU and UK have agreed to create a free trade area with zero tariffs and zero quotas on products that comply with the appropriate rules of origin, regulatory and customs cooperation mechanisms, as well as provisions ensuring a level playing field for open and fair competition, as part of a larger economic partnership. </p>  <p>  Title VI of the Agreement, which sets out the provisions relating to public procurement, goes beyond commitments under the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), to which the UK is in the process of acceding. EU companies will be able to participate on an equal footing with UK companies in bids for procurement tenders covered by the agreement, and vice versa.</p>  <p>  The Agreement further provides for non-discrimination of EU companies established in the UK (and vice versa) for national procurement, i.e. below the current thresholds of the GPA. The Agreement also allows the use of its bilateral dispute settlement mechanisms for disputes that might arise in regards to the procurement opportunities subject to the GPA.</p>  <p>  Changes that are effective as of 1 January 2021 include:</p>  <p>  - The UK is no longer be part of the EU Customs Union - all customs controls and formalities required under EU law, including entry and exit summary declarations, apply to all goods entering the customs territory of the EU from the UK, or leaving that customs territory to the UK. The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland sets out the arrangements that apply in relation to cross-border trade. </p>  <p>  - The EU and the UK are two separate regulatory and legal spaces - all products exported from the EU to the UK have to comply with UK technical regulations and are subject to any applicable regulatory compliance checks and controls. Similarly, all products imported from the UK to the EU need to comply with EU technical regulations and are subject to all applicable regulatory compliance obligations, checks and controls for safety, health and other public policy purposes.</p>  <p>  - Supplies and movements of goods between the EU and the UK are subject to the VAT rules on imports and exports. The Brexit Omnibus Bill 2020 provides for the introduction of &lsquo;Postponed Accounting&rsquo; for VAT on the importation of goods from outside the EU, whereby businesses have the option to account for the VAT due on imports on their periodic VAT return, rather than pay the VAT due at the point of entry of the goods.  There is no change in the method of accounting for VAT on services received from the UK.  The reverse charge continues to apply.  </p>  <p>  - As a general rule, UK nationals, irrespective of where they acquired their qualifications, and EU citizens with qualifications acquired in the UK will need to have their qualifications recognised in the relevant Member State on the basis of each country's existing individual rules applicable to the qualifications of third-country nationals as of the end of the Transition Period.</p>  <p>  The NI Protocol which forms part of the Withdrawal Agreement seeks to avoid a hard border on this island, the Common Travel Area provides additional rights to UK and Irish citizens to live and work in both jurisdictions.  The combined effect of the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement, the NI Protocol and the Common Travel Area means that procurement opportunities in both jurisdictions remain open to businesses on both sides of the border and the UK.</p></reply>

Coupled with the known work and estimated timeframe for each stage, are respective potential risks that are carefully managed, but by their nature can extend time and require allowances for reasonable budget increases. </p><p>Construction budgets are closely monitored in the context of the tendered contract price. The Public Works Contract Form 3, Public Works Contract for Civil Engineering Works (PW-CF3) is used for construction of flood relief schemes. These contracts are priced based primarily on a fixed price lump sum basis (based on the known &lsquo;Works Requirements&rsquo; at tender stage). </p><p>Some of the risks include unforeseen ground conditions, which can be assessed at a high level by means of site investigation works conducted to inform a scheme&rsquo;s design. These investigations, however, are constrained as the lands are often privately owned, and flood relief schemes can extend over long stretches and in built-up areas with varying ground conditions. Therefore, the nature of flood relief works, adjacent to river and/or the sea, means that ground conditions cannot be fully known at the commencement of the construction phase. The scope of construction can evolve as schemes are being built, informed, for example, by agreements reached with landowners. These negotiations may necessarily change elements of the design or alter planned scheme finishes. During construction, other unforeseen issues may also arise, including for example archaeological finds. </p><p>Given the associated risks during construction of a flood relief scheme, variations to the Works set out at tender for design and construction are inevitably necessary during the course of construction. The OPW actively manages these claims but experience is that incorporating variations during the contract can sometimes be complex and often result in disputes being referred to conciliation, leading to additional costs.</p><p>The OPW actively monitors expenditure for each scheme against contract costs and total project budget. The value for money of flood relief schemes is also monitored using a benefit to cost ratio.</p><p>There was also one Estate Management Contracts pertaining to the historic Leinster House in Dublin that exceeded the tender value by 20%.  The agreed tender price was &euro;12.82 million.  The final amount paid was &euro;16.4 million<b></b>exceeding the contract price by 28%.  The excess arose as additional time was required to carry out additional work (at the same tender rates) which only came to light during the contract.  These previously hidden building elements could not have been reasonably foreseen or surveyed prior to contract placement, as the building was in full occupation by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The unforeseen works included significant cracking in internal walls, structurally unstable chimney flues, hidden structural roof defects, poor quality stone and stonework, additional structural works and fireproofing to floors, additional works to plaster ceilings, additional supports for chandeliers and lanterns, additional services and related builders work.</p></reply>

The tender brief for Drogheda and Baltray, also being progressed simultaneously, has been finalised and advertised with tenders due back on 25th   March 2021. The tender brief for the Carlingford and Greenore scheme will begin in the coming months.</p>  <p>  Once consultants are appointed to progress each scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the general public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the proposals within the scheme.</p>  <p>  In County Meath the Ashbourne Flood Alleviation Scheme is currently at the Construction Stage, having  commenced in 2019 with a completion timeframe of later this year. The Scheme comprises of the construction of an overflow weir to divert flow to the Broadmeadow River and the improvement of the channel and culvert capacity along the Broadmeadow and Ward Scheme. It will provide protection against a 100-Year flood event for a total of 69 properties.  This scheme is being carried out by the Office of Public Works direct labour.</p>  <p>  As part of the CFRAM Programme, Mornington, Co. Meath, was identified as being one of 300 areas believed to be of significant flood risk and the scheme, with funding from the OPW a scheme is being progressed by Meath County Council.</p></reply>

The country is at present at Level 5 of this Plan and this will apply nationally. The Level 5 restrictions will remain in place until midnight on 31 January 2021.</p><p>At Level 5, the public health risk means that people are being asked to stay at home, except for travel for essential work or other essential purposes, or to take exercise within 5km of home. There will be no gatherings other than small numbers at funerals and weddings. No indoor or outdoor exercise group activities, including those involving children, should take place.</p><p>Under Level 5 no exercise or dance classes, no indoor or outdoor gatherings involving &ldquo;individual training&rdquo; except for professional and elite sports should take place.</p><p>My Department provides regular guidance for the Arts and Culture sector in respect of current restrictions in relation to COVID-19 and the latest information can be accessed on the gov.ie website at the following link:  . My Department is also in regular contact with the Arts Council, and other parts of the Government, ensuring how best to manage through the crisis.</p><p>The Arts Council have prepared guidance on dance practice and training, when restrictions permit and these are available on their website. In addition the Arts Council supports a number of resource and representative organisations to provide advice and information to artists within their given sector and many of these are providing support and advice online. Further information on these resource organisations can be accessed on the Arts Council website at the following link: <i>  .</i></p><p>It is recognised that this decision will have an impact on people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods, but the clear message is that we must all now stay at home, with the exception of essential purposes, in order to stop the spread of the virus. Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19 means that the virus poses a serious threat and the rate of infection is increasing significantly in the community.  The more we work together to reduce the level of the virus, the more activity we will be able to have in our communities.</p><p>Supports such as the PUP and the CRSS will continue to be made available to those impacted. Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is also available to help maintain people in jobs.Further details of the range of government supports available to help businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-13a.805.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021011300065#WRN01700"><p>I am strongly supportive of the promotion of Irish music on our broadcasting services. Ireland has a strong and vibrant music sector, which is recognised across the world. As Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am keen to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to further nurture and protect this sector.</p>  <p>  However, I am conscious of the legal and other factors which must be taken into account when considering the feasibility of introducing airplay quotas. The potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to ensure commercial revenue particularly in the context of the current media climate. Importantly, the introduction of airplay quotas would need to be consistent with EU law.</p>  <p>  An example of airplay quotas in the EU can be seen in France. In 1994, France introduced a mandatory quota for 40% airplay of French language music on French radio stations, this quota was reduced to 35% in 2016.  Any quota for airplay would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music meeting certain criteria in a more advantaged position.  However, a quota for airplay of music in a particular language, as is the case in France, can be justified under EU case law, as the preservation and promotion of an official language of a Member State constitutes a general interest objective. Unlike music in a particular language, a quota system for music produced in a particular place, as suggested in this question, does not appear to have grounds for exemption from the general requirements of EU law.  Therefore, without a similar justification on the grounds of linguistic protection, a quota for music produced in a particular Member State would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music produced in other Member States at a disadvantage.</p>  <p>  Given the legal challenges arising, the Government is not currently considering airplay quotas based on production location.  I will however continue to support Irish musicians and musical content, though initiatives within my Department and through funding for the Arts Council.  The Arts Council is the state body through which the Government funds the arts, including music, in Ireland. Arts Council funding has increased from &euro;80m at the beginning of last year to &euro;130m this year &ndash; an increase of over 60%. I also provided significant targeted funding last year for music and musicians including very successful national events - Other Voices: Courage, the Hot Press Young and Emerging series, Ireland Performs and the Music Industry Stimulus Package. A very significant proportion of over &euro;5m allocated to the Live Performance Support Scheme was allocated to musicians. In 2021, the Government has allocated &euro;50m for live performance. These benefits are over and above economy wide supports, principally the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. My Department will continue to engage with the sector to tailor supports to the needs of musicians and other artists. I appointed a number of musicians to the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce.</p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the challenges faced by the live music sector as a result of necessary public health restrictions. To complement the live performance and music industry support package I have put in place, I have requested that the BAI will include a special emphasis on applications that support the live music sector within a general round of Sound and Vision to be put in place in Q1 2021 and I have provided additional funding of &euro;1.4m to support this.</p>  <p>   </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

This applies to sporting activities organised by recognised National Governing Bodies of sport as well as activities organised by other associations and clubs.</p><p>The Government fully acknowledges the benefits of sport and physical activity for people&rsquo;s mental and physical well-being and has done its utmost to facilitate sport as much as it can within the confines imposed by the public health situation, which remains a serious and ongoing threat to people&rsquo;s lives. On behalf of the Return to Sport Expert Group, Sport Ireland has issued practical guidance for the sports and physical activity sector, which is available on its website and can be applied by all sporting clubs and groups.  </p><p>Detailed operating protocols aligned with public health advice will continue to be required, as and when the Government determines that a return to sporting activity can be facilitated. It is also essential that these protocols are underpinned by robust compliance and monitoring structures and processes to ensure effective and consistent compliance and adherence with their requirements, a function which will continue to be fulfilled by the National Governing Bodies under the supervision of Sport Ireland. </p><p>The recognition process for achieving the status of a National Governing Body for a sport in Ireland is a matter solely for Sport Ireland, which has the legislative responsibility for the development of sport in Ireland pursuant to the Sport Ireland Act 2015. There are over 60 recognised National Governing Bodies which have each demonstrated their capacity to organise training and competitions in their respective codes and to implement policies for health and safety, safeguarding and other matters. These cover a broad range of sports from field sports, Olympic disciplines and minority sports. There are also a number of sporting bodies which are currently working towards recognition, with the support of Sport Ireland. Further information on the recognition process is available on the agency's website <i>www.sportireland.ie</i>.</p></reply>

If a sports club or organisation is acquiring land or buildings, developing facilities, purchasing fixed non-personal equipment for sports activities, or repaying a loan for these purposes, Section 41 of the Finance Act 2002 provides a tax relief incentive to individuals or companies to make a donation towards the cost of these projects. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to this Revenue scheme is to confirm that the projects in question comply with the eligibility criteria for sporting projects and issues a certificate in this regard. In relation to this however, it is a requirement that work cannot have already started prior to the application for the Tax relief. This requirement is set down in Section 847A Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 sub section 4 which states:- "The Minister, on the making of an application by an approved sports body in advance of the undertaking by that body of a project, may give a certificate to that body stating that the project to be undertaken by that body may be treated as an approved project for the purposes of this section". </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, my Department has no discretion in relation to this requirement.  If however, the club referred to by the Deputy has incurred debts in completing eligible works, it may be possible to claim tax relief for donations used to pay off this debt. In addition, my Department will be happy to consider any request for certification for any future phases of the club&rsquo;s development plans.   Accordingly, the club may wish to contact the Sports Capital Division of my Department (email SportsCapitalProgrammes@tcagsm.gov.ie) to discuss  further.  </p></reply>

The Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003, operates within a published ten-year strategic framework entitled Making Great Art Work. The Arts Council supports and develops theatre in Ireland through grant funding, project awards, support to individual artists, and support to venues, publications and resource organisations. Further details  of can be accessed on the Arts Council&rsquo;s decisions database which  gives a listing of 2008&ndash;2020 Arts Council funding decisions as follows; . </p><p>At the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, the Arts Council said it will honour all existing funding commitments, and allow grantees to draw down 90 percent of their funding to allow them fulfil in turn their own business commitments, especially to artists.</p><p>A range of measures were announced as part of Budget 2021 to support the arts and culture sectors and in particular the music and entertainment sectors. As mentioned previously Government funding to the Arts Council in 2021 will amount to &euro;130m which is an increase of 62% over the amount initially allocated for 2020. Much of this funding is being allocated to the performance arts including those who have never before received funding from the Council.</p><p>The Council have in place a number of new and enhanced funding programmes which have been introduced in response to COVID-19. These include:</p><p>- enhanced commissioning, projects and bursary awards;</p><p>-  an Emergency Stabilisation Fund;</p><p>-  the COVID-19 Response Award;</p><p>-  a Capacity Building Support Scheme;</p><p>-  a Professional Development Award;</p><p>-  the COVID-19 Completion Funding Scheme;</p><p>My Department also operates a number of capital investment schemes in respect of cultural venues such as theatres.  A number of funding streams are provided from a &euro;40m capital investment allocation for local arts and culture infrastructure contained in Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>In response to COVID-19, my Department opened a further stream (Stream D) of funding specifically for capital adaptations or equipment necessary to assist arts and culture organisations in re-opening. Under this stream capital funding is provided to assist in the re-opening of theatres, arts centres and culture venues as part of Project Ireland 2040. The measures are designed to support arts and culture facilities in preparation for staff, artists and audiences returning to venues to reopen in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business as well as the Return to Work Safety Protocols. There is a high degree of flexibility which will allow organisations to undertake necessary capital adaptations to their buildings so that they comply with the HSE COVID-19 related public health protection measures. Not-for-profit organisations with a clearly defined arts and cultural remit can apply for this Stream D.  Further details of these schemes along with eligibility criteria and other information, can be found at this link </p><p>The Deputy has made specific reference to community theatres and may wish to also know that the Department of Rural and Community Development funds a range of programmes and schemes to assist in rural and community development which are available to eligible community groups and organisations throughout the country. These schemes provide funding, support and assistance to communities at local level and include the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the LEADER programme; the Community Enhancement Programme, the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme; the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Community Services Programme. Details of how to apply for these schemes are on the Government's website at the following link </p><p>Under the current Level 5 restrictions supports such as the PUP and the CRSS will continue to be made available to those impacted.

Sport Ireland promotes the planning and development of recreational trails and outdoor recreation infrastructure by promoting standards and best practice in the development of walking, cycling and water trails. Sport Ireland Outdoors maintains a National Trail Register of over 900 approved trails that align with the prescribed standards for trails in Ireland.The remit of Sport Ireland in this area is focused on capacity building, advice and guidance. </p><p>Sport Ireland does not maintain or manage trails or upland areas in general nor does it provide or erect signage for same. All such work on trails is carried out locally by a trail management organisation for the trail.

Accordingly, Sport Ireland has no direct involvement with this route.  </p><p>Sport Ireland understands that at other locations which are popular with hill walkers but where there are no formal trails, signage has been erected by a local management organisation e.g. in the Carrauntoohil area by The MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountain Access Forum and in Wicklow by the Wicklow Uplands Forum. Sport Ireland has suggested that the local authority or the local development company may be in a position to address this matter by erecting signage.</p></reply>

In order to promote the use of tap water intended for human consumption, article 16 of the Directive requires that Member States shall ensure that outdoor and indoor equipment is set up in public spaces, where technically feasible, in a manner that is proportionate to the need for such measures and taking into account specific local conditions, such as climate and geography. Member States may also take the following measures to promote the use of tap water intended for human consumption:</p><p>(a) raising awareness of the nearest outdoor or indoor equipment;  </p><p>(b) launching campaigns to inform citizens about the quality of such water;  </p><p>(c)  encouraging the provision of such water in public administrations and public buildings;  </p><p>(d)  encouraging the provision of such water, for free or for a low service fee, for customers in restaurants, canteens and catering services.  </p><p>Member States must transpose article 16 of the Directive by 12 January 2023. </p><p>My Department will implement the commitment in the Programme for Government as part of the transposition and implementation of article 16 of Directive 2020/2184, as described above.</p></reply>

This included sixteen new builds and ten upgrade/refurbishment projects. A total of &euro;10.44m has been spent for new and upgraded fire stations from 2018 to date under the 2016 &ndash; 2020 programme, as detailed in the table below. Fire station projects completed under this Programme include Ballinamore, Carraroe, Drumshanbo, Ferbane, Graiguenmanagh, Templemore, Tuam and Virginia; with refurbishments at Ennis, Ennistymon, Kilrush and Longford; as well as upgrades of Clonmel, Dundalk and Hacketstown Training Centres. </p><p>I recently announced a new Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021 - 2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61 million. Following extensive engagement with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works etc. were received. The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p><p>- area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.);</p><p>- established Health and Safety needs; </p><p>- state of development of the project (is site acquired, etc.); and </p><p>- value for money offered by the proposal.</p><p>This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In order to maximise the available funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally. </p><p>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the table below. </p><p>Table: Fire Services Capital Programme Fire Station Expenditure 2018 &ndash; 2021 <table>    <tr>       <th>Fire   Authority</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow Coco</td>       <td>&euro;115,612</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;96,217</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan Coco</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;1,448,141</td>       <td>&euro;191,086</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare Coco</td>       <td>&euro;150,974</td>       <td>&euro;503,219</td>       <td>&euro;254,982</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork Coco</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;241,566</td>       <td>&euro;549,243</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway Coco</td>       <td>&euro;1,711,760</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;53,531</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim Coco</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;603,923</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford Coco</td>       <td>&euro;270,030</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth Coco</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;84,475</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath Coco</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;151,215</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan Coco</td>       <td>&euro;39,558</td>       <td>&euro;193,313</td>       <td>&euro;1,034,221</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly Coco</td>       <td>&euro;222,385</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;123,733</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary Coco</td>       <td>&euro;190,508</td>       <td>&euro;85,000</td>       <td>&euro;1,629,098</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow Coco</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;142,390</td>       <td>&euro;-</td>       <td>&euro;- </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

These statistics are updated on a quarterly basis and data for Q4 of 2020 is now being validated and will be published as soon as possible. There is not always a direct relationship between the funding provided for the acquisition of 2nd hand properties in any year and the number of new social homes delivered where, for example, a property might be acquired in one year but upgrade works and the allocation of the property, may follow in the subsequent year. Acquisitions of 2nd hand properties are also carried out under my Department's Traveller Accomodation Programme and by Approved Housing Bodies with funding support from my Department; these are not included in the above data. </p><p>My Department does not provide a funding allocation to any local authority for the acquisition of 2nd hand houses for social housing purposes; rather each local authority has an annual target for the delivery of social housing and funding is drawn down by each local authority in line with their delivery. </p><p>In line with the Programme for Government 2020 &ndash; Our Shared Future, our objective is to increase the social housing stock by over 50,000 over the next five-years through a focus on new build.  It is important therefore, that all local authorities prioritise the delivery of new social homes by construction over acquisitions.</p></reply>

This Strategy strives to provide a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across Ireland. </p>  <p>  The activities of the Vacant Homes Officers are already comprehensive, any potential expansion of their current role will be carefully reviewed and targeted and will reflect the Government&rsquo;s commitment to bringing vacant properties back into use across the country. </p>  <p>  The role of Vacant Homes Officer is wide ranging and includes (but is not limited to);</p>  <p>  - tasks that support, implement and further develop, update, monitor and review the progress of local authorities&rsquo; Vacant Homes Action Plans and actions to address vacant private housing, </p>  <p>  - establishing a co-ordinated approach towards the implementation of the Action Plans within each local authority,</p>  <p>  - undertaking initial vacancy assessment exercise (drilling into available CSO / GeoDirectory data), </p>  <p>  - carrying out or co-ordinating visual inspections / assessment of residential properties in their administrative area, with a view to identifying possible vacant recoverable homes,</p>  <p>  - identification of the registered owners of the properties deemed to be vacant from inspection, and contacting the owners on the options available to assist in bringing their properties back into use for private or social housing purposes,</p>  <p>  - serving as a contact point for dissemination to members of the public (including landlords), assistance and information on residential vacancy and the schemes available to re-introduce their homes into the usable housing stock, </p>  <p>  - serving as a contact point for dissemination to interested parties of the &lsquo;Guidance on the Reuse of Existing Buildings for Residential purposes&rsquo; (published in December 2018); and </p>  <p>  - the collation and provision of vacant homes data to my Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit on an agreed timely basis.</p>  <p>  The Vacant Homes Officers have a number of supporting schemes to assist property owners to bring their vacant properties back into use for social housing &ndash; the Repair &amp;amp; Lease Scheme, the Buy and Renew Scheme or Long Term Leasing.  The maximum loan for property repair available under the Repair and Leases scheme has recently been increased by my Department from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000. This funding increase will mean that property owners who cannot afford or access funding to bring their vacant stock up to standard and back into use will be able to do so to provide social housing. It has an added benefit of increasing investment and employment into the local construction and retail sectors while also providing for the regeneration of local communities.</p>  <p>  The Vacant Homes Unit in my Department recently ran an advertising campaign in national newspapers directed at owners of vacant properties. The advertisement alerted owners to the vacant homes schemes available to them. On foot of this, we received a very strong response from the public, and as a result many Vacant Homes Officers are in the process of engaging with owners of potentially suitable properties to be brought back into use.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to reducing and preventing homelessness.  It sets out details on how the Government will approach this challenge, and includes a commitment to develop a National Youth Homelessness Strategy.  Preparing this strategy will involve co-operation and co-ordination between myself and my colleague the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Key operational elements in the provision of supports to young people experiencing homelessness, or at risk of homelessness, fall within the responsibility of a range of agencies and stakeholder bodies, and it will be important that their views can form part of the process in developing the Strategy.  My Department is currently engaged in preliminary scoping work in respect of the National Youth Homelessness Strategy and I expect that work on the Strategy will develop through 2021.</p>  <p>  Upon my appointment as Minister, I established a High Level Homelessness Taskforce, to provide a forum for engagement with key organisations working to address homelessness. The Taskforce will also input on the implementation of the commitments on homelessness in the Programme for Government.  The membership of the taskforce consists of the Chief Executives of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, Crosscare, Depaul, Focus Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, Dublin Simon Community and Threshold.  Youth homelessness is one of the areas of interest in the work of the Task Force.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the matter of youth homelessness is one of the issues addressed in recommendations made by the Dublin City Council Lord Mayor&rsquo;s Task Force on Homelessness in a report prepared in December 2020.  I met with the Lord Mayor's Task Force on 11 December 2020 and note that the report recommends that a youth homelessness prevention and intervention strategy should be developed involving Dublin City Council and other agencies and stakeholders. I welcome this report and am currently considering its wider contents and recommendations, as they relate to my own role as Minister and that of my Department.</p></reply>

The number of individuals in emergency accommodation has been reducing since late 2019.</p>  <p>  Homelessness is complex and causal factors and family circumstances vary considerably as do the responses needed. Homelessness is also inter-related with the other areas of the housing system and with broader social and healthcare policy and service delivery. Therefore, a whole of Government approach is required in dealing with this challenge.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that many households experiencing homelessness have additional support needs and includes specific measures to address these needs. These include measures to help rough sleepers into sustainable accommodation, the continued expansion of Housing First, with a focus on the construction and acquisition of one-bed homes, and, importantly, ensuring that there is dedicated funding and resources to deliver the necessary health and mental health supports required to assist homeless people with complex needs.</p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing, particularly new build social and affordable homes, is a priority for me and for this Government. The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds. In Budget 2021, we backed this objective with funding of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing.  The available funding will deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes. The increased targets will see increased local authority build on local authority land.</p></reply>

Both schemes provide for lease terms of up to 25 years and Local Authorities should seek to use the maximum term available where possible. </p>  <p>  To end Q3 2020, 1 Part V unit was delivered through leasing arrangements.  In 2019 a total of 14 Part V units were delivered through leasing, with a total of 9 delivered through leasing in 2018.</p></reply>

It has been available nationwide from all local authorities since 1 February 2018. It is targeted at first time buyers who wish to own their own home, have access to an adequate deposit and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but who are unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home. The loan is a normal capital and interest-bearing mortgage which is repaid by direct debit on a monthly basis.</p><p>A person can borrow up to 90% of the market value of the property and the maximum market values of the property that can be purchased or self-built are:</p><p>-  &euro;320,000in the counties of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and</p><p>&euro;250,000in the rest of the country.</p><p>To be eligible for a Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan you must: be a first-time buyer; be aged between 18 and 70 years; be in continuous employment for a minimum of two years, as the primary earner or be in continuous employment for a minimum of one year, as a secondary earner; have an annual gross income of not more than &euro;50,000 as a single applicant or not more than &euro;75,000 combined as joint applicants; submit two years certified accounts if self-employed; provide evidence of insufficient offers of finance from two banks or building societies; not be a current or previous owner of residential property in or outside the Republic of Ireland; occupy the property as your normal place of  residence; purchase or self-build a property situated in the Republic of Ireland of no more than of 175 square metres (gross internal floor area); purchase or self-build a property which does not exceed the maximum market value applicable for the county in which it is located; and consent to an Irish Credit Bureau check.</p><p>Eligibility is subject to submission of a complete Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan application form and confirmation by your local authority.</p><p>The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis.  Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the Regulations establishing the scheme and the credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches in the best interests of both borrowers and the lending local authorities.</p><p>Further information on the scheme is available on the dedicated website <i>www.rebuildingirelandhomeloan.ie</i>.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 made provision to enhance the rental data to be provided to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), including provision for the annual registration of tenancies. The aim is to gather more accurate and detailed tenancy and rental data on an annual basis to improve the information available to assist with policy formulation in the residential rental sector.</p>  <p>  The amendments to sections 137 and 137A of the Residential Tenancies  Act 2004, contained in sections 25 and 26 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019, update the RTB tenancy registration fee in the context of the move to annual registration - providing a &euro;40 fee per tenancy registration by private providers and &euro;20 per tenancy registration by an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  Under the new annual registration requirements, a fee can only be charged in respect of the same dwelling once per year and a discounted single registration fee (&euro;170 for a private landlord, &euro;85 for an AHB landlord) can be applied where the same landlord registers up to 10 tenancies of dwellings comprised in the same property.</p>  <p>  The legal provisions requiring the annual registration of tenancies and setting associated registration fees have not yet come into operation. Preparations are underway in the RTB to roll out a simple online registration system during the second half of 2021 to cater for the commencement of annual registration. </p></reply>

One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, to facilitate more widespread generation of energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review, which continues to be shaped by recommendations of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings.</p>  <p>  The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for "glint and glare" impacts for aircraft from solar panels erected in proximity to airports and aerodromes and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department is presently engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. The Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion. As such, these maps, which are a fundamental aspect of any amendments to the exemptions, are expected to be finalised in Q3 2021.</p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, any such proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made. The draft regulations will also be subject to environmental assessment reporting considerations before being finalised and signed into force. The overall process for revising the solar panel planning exemptions is now expected to be completed by Q4 2021.</p></reply>

It is intended to be used as a guide for the owners and occupants of dwellings (houses and apartments) where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern, to develop strategies to improve fire safety and to develop strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.

Following extensive engagement with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works etc. were received. The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p>  <p>  -  Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.)</p>  <p>  -  established Health and Safety needs </p>  <p>  -  state of development of the project (is site acquired, etc.?) and </p>  <p>  -  value for money offered by the proposal.</p>  <p>  This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally.  </p>  <p>  A new fire station at Urlingford is provided for in this Capital Programme.

Consultations are ongoing  across relevant Government Departments which look forward to receiving additional information on the Technology Access Pool with a view to considering practical engagement. The European Commission, on behalf of Member States, is engaging with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to obtain the additional information and clarifications required for industry to engage in the initiative. This is in addition to the regular meetings at official level with the WHO on Covid-19 and other health matters.</p>  <p>  During this public health crisis, a well-functioning ecosystem for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights is an important incentive for the research and development of novel vaccines, medicines and treatments. Ireland will continue to engage with partners to find innovative ways to support these aims, part of our comprehensive global response to the global challenge. </p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department, through Irish Aid is planning at least &euro;50 million in support of Global Health, working with relevant multilateral agencies including the WHO, sustaining health systems (including maintaining capacity for vaccine campaigns), ensuring attention to other diseases, and funding the work of the Health Service Executive (HSE) Global Health Programme in Ethiopia, Mozambique and elsewhere.  This includes an additional allocation of &euro;5 million in support of COVAX (the global Covid-19 vaccine facility), which will ensure developing countries have access to vaccines, as well as supporting the WHO role in ensuring equity and fairness in the process.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department raised concerns over the use of the death penalty with the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland on 2 December. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific execution of Ruhollah Zam, we endorse the condemnation released on behalf of the EU on 12 December 2020. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also regularly voiced opposition to the use of the death penalty by Iran in appropriate international fora. At the 45th session of the Human Rights Council (HRC) in September 2020, Ireland co-signed a Joint Statement which expressed deep concern at the continuing human rights violations in Iran, making particular reference to Iran&rsquo;s ill-treatment of detainees and use of the death penalty. The statement states clearly that &ldquo;we reiterate our opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances, and urge Iran to enact a moratorium.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to raise human rights issues with Iran at every suitable opportunity, including in our direct contacts with Iranian officials, in contributing to EU policy on Iran, and in international fora such as the UN General Assembly and the HRC.</p></reply>

Any endeavour to enhance resources available, and share relevant knowledge, should be welcomed and supported.  </p>  <p>  During this public health crisis, a well-functioning ecosystem for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights is an important incentive for the research and development of novel vaccines, medicines and treatments. Ireland will continue to engage with partners to find innovative ways to support these aims, part of our comprehensive global response to the global challenge. For 2021, Irish Aid is planning at least &euro;50 million in support of Global Health, working with relevant multilateral agencies including the WHO, sustaining health systems (including maintaining capacity for vaccine campaigns), ensuring attention to other diseases, and funding the work of the Health Service Executive (HSE) Global Health Programme in Ethiopia, Mozambique and elsewhere. This includes an additional allocation of &euro;5 million in support of COVAX (the global Covid-19 vaccine facility), which will ensure developing countries have access to vaccines, as well as supporting the WHO role in ensuring equity and fairness in the process.</p></reply>

Refugees from Syria are the biggest refugee population from a single conflict in a generation, with over 5.5 million having fled to neighbouring countries. Lebanon, with over 1.5 million Syrian refugees, hosts the largest numbers of refugees per capita in the world, 20 per cent of its population.  </p>  <p>  The capacity of local communities and Syrian refugees to provide mutual support is being placed under severe strain by economic turmoil and the Covid-19 crisis. The generosity of the Lebanese people in hosting such a large number of refugees has to be acknowledged.  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian policy will continue to support refugees and vulnerable host communities. </p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department, through Irish Aid, provided &euro;4.25 million in humanitarian assistance to Lebanon, through the UN&rsquo;s Lebanon Humanitarian Fund, the UN Relief and Works Agency, as well as Concern and Tr&oacute;caire.  Each of these partners is crucial to supporting the ongoing refugee response.  Overall, Ireland has provided approximately &euro;31 million in funding to Lebanon since 2014.  In the year ahead, I envisage Ireland maintaining its level of financial support as humanitarian and development needs will remain high.</p>  <p>  Also, since 2012, Irish Aid has deployed close to 20 skilled and experienced volunteers to Lebanon to work with UN humanitarian agencies in their humanitarian or emergency response operations.</p>  <p>  Ireland also responds to existing needs in Lebanon through the EU.  Since its establishment in 2014, a significant share of the EU's support for Syrian refugees and Syria's neighbouring countries has been provided through the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis. The Fund primarily addresses educational, economic, social and health needs of Syrian refugees while also supporting overstretched local communities and their administrations. The Fund has mobilised &euro;1 billion for Lebanon.  </p>  <p>  The devastating explosion in August 2020 in the port of Beirut was a very serious setback. The EU mobilised &euro;32 million to support the most vulnerable Lebanese and refugee communities. This brought the total EU humanitarian assistance to &euro;83 million in 2020.</p>  <p>  Immediately following the explosion, Ireland provided significant stocks of medical supplies, including Personal Protective Equipment, to the World Health Organisation in Beirut which coordinated the health response to the crisis. These supplies were transported by the Irish Defence Forces which, following decades of distinguished service in UNIFIL, have a strong relationship with Lebanon.</p></reply>

Practices such as this, as highlighted by a recent UNFPA report, must be tackled to achieve gender equality. The report highlighted the importance of tackling the root causes, in particular gender-biased norms in society, and the need to invest in grassroots actions by communities to end these practices. </p>  <p>  Ending gender based violence and harmful practices is a central priority for Ireland&rsquo;s foreign and development policy. We will continue to advocate for this strongly across all of our multilateral engagements, including at the Security Council, while continuing to provide funding to partners working to end GBV and harmful practices globally. </p>  <p>  Ireland is consistently among those OECD countries with the highest proportion of official development assistance (ODA) which contributes to gender equality. In 2019, approximately 76% (&euro;295 million), of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral allocable aid contributed to gender equality.  Of this, over &euro;15 million was invested in actions to prevent gender-based violence, or in support of those who have suffered from GBV.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland contributes a significant amount of multilateral funding to organisations such as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, UNFPA and UN Women who are working to end practices such as breast ironing.  Ireland also provides annual funding to the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women, supporting efforts to address GBV at grassroots level in over 80 countries.</p></reply>

The FAC is due to discuss the issue of Climate and Energy Diplomacy on 25 January and Council Conclusions are currently under negotiation.  Following adoption of the Council Conclusions on the 25 January we can then look forward to presentation by the Commission of a proposal for a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, as planned for in the Commission's 2021 Work Programme.  We are not aware at present of plans for such a proposal to be presented to or discussed at FAC. </p>  <p>  The 2021 Work Programme of the Commission states an intention to align relevant climate and energy legislation with the newly proposed target to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030, as compared to 1990 levels.  This is to be brought together in a &ldquo;Fit for 55 Package&rdquo; to implement the European Green Deal.  As part of these measures the Commission will propose a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) to help motivate foreign producers and EU importers to reduce their carbon emissions, while ensuring a level-playing field conducive to trade in a WTO-compatible way.  This CBAM proposal is planned for the second quarter of 2021 (legislative, including impact assessment).</p></reply>

Immigration issues have been raised on an ongoing basis in our engagement with the US Administration and political leaders. I have raised these issues in contacts with the US Ambassador, as well as with members of the US Administration and both Houses of Congress, most recently during my visit to Washington D.C. at the end of September last year.</p>  <p>  In the US, our Embassy and Consulates General across the country continue to monitor the situation closely and to engage with US officials on immigration issues, including with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They also actively support Irish community groups that provide assistance and information to vulnerable Irish and the undocumented.</p>  <p>  Many of these community groups are members of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, which receive significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme (ESP). In 2019, over &euro;3m was allocated to 88 organisations across the US, including those that provide front-line welfare assistance to Irish citizens. Furthermore, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable. In 2020, over &euro;3.6m was paid to diaspora organisations in the US for ESP and Covid related projects.</p>  <p>  We look forward to working closely with President-elect Joe Biden and the incoming Administration, as well as with the United States Congress, across the aisle, to pursue comprehensive immigration reform in the US. Our Embassy and network of Consulates General will continue to monitor the situation and stand ready to engage with any Federal and State initiatives on this issue.</p>  <p>  In terms of securing future pathways for immigration, we continue to prioritise the E3 Visa Bill. If passed, this could allow access to thousands of US visas each year to Irish citizens, providing new opportunities to live and work in the US.  We will continue to explore all available options for securing this.</p></reply>

Promoting national ownership is one of the key principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Ireland believes that national ownership is essential to the success of development, especially in reaching the furthest behind first. </p>  <p>  Ireland also recognises that Parliaments have a critical role to play in overseeing and scrutinising national development programmes to reduce poverty, build democracy and ensure national ownership. </p>  <p>  The 2020 OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) Peer Review of Ireland found that &lsquo;a long-lasting commitment to engaging in partnerships is the trademark of Irelands&rsquo; development co-operation&rdquo;. The Department of Foreign Affairs continues to promote the important principle of partnerships with local Parliaments in developing countries. The Department supports programmes to strengthen legislatures ability to scrutinise national development efforts, and to more effectively fulfils its constitutional mandate. </p>  <p>  All eleven of Ireland&rsquo;s Missions in Sub Saharan Africa with responsibility for managing aid programmes, have a strong focus on ensuring that essential services including health, education, and social protection are targeted at those who are furthest behind in the poorest communities.  The national strategies supported by the aid programme have all been scrutinised and passed by national Parliaments.</p>  <p>  In addition, the aid programme has supported the development of Parliamentary capacity for oversight of budgets and other issues.  For example, last year Irish Aid provided funding to the African European Parliamentarians Initiative (AEPI), to advance development issues within Parliaments in a number of countries, in Europe and in Africa. This is intended to foster collaborative action in areas such as capacity building, transparency and accountability, peace and security, and global health.</p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas. Equipment priorities for acquisition will now also align with the Equipment Development Plan for the Defence Forces published in June 2020. This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper on Defence in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed and considered through joint civil-military co-operation, ensuring that the Defence Forces will have the best equipment for the job, based on a determination of priorities from a whole of defence standpoint.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces operate a fire station at the Defence Forces Training Centre (DFTC), Curragh Camp, a Crash Rescue Service based in Casement Aerodrome Baldonnel, and has a fire crew deployed overseas in Lebanon.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces fire station at the Defence Forces Training Centre (DFTC), Curragh Camp operates with one fire crew on duty at all times. The main purpose of the fire station is to provide a rapid response in the event of a fire at the Ammunition Depot, and also to respond to fire alarms and fire emergencies within the DFTC. </p>  <p>  Certain purchasing is carried out by the Defence Forces directly under delegation of financial responsibility which permits the Defence Forces to procure a wide range of goods and services directly, this includes the purchasing of fire appliances. I am advised by the military authorities that the DFTC fire station is adequately equipped with a Class B Fire Appliance which was delivered in 2018 following an open tender competition, as well as a reserve Fire Tender which was registered in 1999 and a Ford Ranger procured in 2019. Since the procurement of the Class B Fire Appliance in 2018, the reserve Fire Tender has been used exclusively for training purposes. There is currently no requirement for the acquisition of additional fire appliances for the DFTC.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces continue to have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

The P50 mid-life upgrade programme is well underway.  </p>  <p>  L&Eacute; Ciara was built in 1984 and underwent a planned annual dry-docking at the end 2019 and is operational. The vessel has in the last year, for example, assisted the Coast Guard in Search and Rescue operations. As a result of the White Paper commitment to vessel replacement, the replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) is the immediate White Paper project in this context. Planning has commenced on this project and it is intended to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the MRV, subject to availability of funding within the overall Defence capital funding envelope. Projects for other vessel replacement will be considered over the life-time of the White Paper in the context of overall capability development and funding and the Equipment Development Plan (EDP) process.  </p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and maritime capability, within the financial envelope available.

The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022.   Budget 2021 provides for a further increased gross allocation to &euro;131m in the defence capital budget in respect of equipment and barracks infrastructure.  This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is made available for deployments, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises.</p><p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Joint Task Force was established to coordinate the Defence Forces contribution to the whole-of-Government COVID-19 response.

The wide range of supports that the Defence Forces have provided to the HSE, as coordinated by the Joint Task Force during the COVID-19 crisis include:</p><p>-  operation of the COVID-19 testing centre at the Aviva stadium; </p><p>-  support for contact tracing efforts;</p><p>-  transportation by the Air Corps of COVID-19 tests to Germany;</p><p>-  collection of PPE from more than 260 cargo flights and the ongoing storage and distribution of this PPE to various HSE sites;</p><p>-  support for HSE testing efforts including through deployment of Naval Service vessels to Dublin, Cork and Galway; </p><p>-  PPE training to workers at Cork and Waterford harbours by Naval service personnel;</p><p>-  provision of tentage and marshalling support at various HSE testing sites around the country;</p><p>-  transportation of patients for testing;</p><p>-  assistance with the fit out of temporary facilities for the HSE (for example, the HSE facilities at City West and the University of Limerick);</p><p>-  production and assembly of PPE using 3D printing facilities; and</p><p>-  the use of lands at Ballymullen Barracks as a COVID-19 testing facility and contact tracing hub.</p><p>In addition to supporting the HSE, the Defence Forces have also provided a broad range of supports to other Departments and Agencies.  Provision of this support was also coordinated by the Joint Task Force.  Examples include:</p><p>-  Support has been provided to the National Ambulance Service through Defence Forces ambulance and crew supports along with tele-triage supports.</p><p>-  Support to the Office of Government Procurement through assistance with storage and distribution of PPE.</p><p>-  Support to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through the use of lands at Sarsfields Barracks for the location of one of the National Temporary Body Storage Facilities. The Defence Forces were also on standby to provide support if required at the Dublin based National Temporary Body Storage Facility at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.</p><p>At the end of December 2020, the Defence Forces had deployed a daily average of 183 personnel to support the Covid 19 response.  </p><p>The Defence Forces are also represented on the High Level Task Force for Covid-19 Vaccination.</p><p>With regard to the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine, the Defence Forces are ready to provide transportation supports where required by the HSE. </p><p>While the HSE has not requested the Defence Forces assistance in the actual giving of the vaccine to date, the Defence Forces are developing a training protocol for Defence Forces medical personnel as a contingency measure.</p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher is now &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.  The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance).  The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.  This agreement is benefitting 18,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  On 10 December 2020, draft proposals on a new public service pay agreement were agreed following formal discussions between DPER and the Public Services Committee of ICTU, with consultation and input from the sectors including my Department. These proposals will now be considered in detail by the various unions and their members. There is a specific provision in relation to new entrant teacher pay which allows for the skipping of Point 12 of the pay scale which is a further improvement in pay for new entrant teachers. This measure will resolve in full the remaining salary scale issues pertaining to new entrant teachers. This builds on the series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through the various pay agreements. It shows the benefits that continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions can bring.</p></reply>

It enables the student teacher to experience teaching and learning in a variety of contexts, and to participate in school life in a way that is structured and supported.</p>  <p>  In consultation with my Department and the relevant stakeholders, the Teaching Council published a Guidance Note on School Placement 2020/2021 in August 2020. In the context of Covid-19, this Guidance Note sets out a clear and flexible framework for both Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and schools in relation to the planning and facilitation of school placement for the academic year 2020-2021.</p>  <p>  It recognises a variety of sites of practice and learning in which school placement can be completed taking account of the sites of practice that emerged for teaching and learning following the closure of schools due to Covid-19 in March 2020. It also acknowledges that flexibility in terms of modes of assessment of student teachers by HEI tutors is necessary and outlines a range of feasible options that can be considered by HEIs. </p>  <p>  In light of the evolving context, my Department and the Teaching Council have had ongoing engagement with stakeholders in respect of the practical implementation of this guidance since its publication in August 2020 and will continue to engage with stakeholders in this regard. </p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solution and subject to procurement and regulatory requirements. Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided. The Department's High Speed Broadband Programme provides all recognised post-primary schools, high speed broadband with a minimum broadband speed of 100mbs with many now on 200 Mbp/s plus connectivity. There are 58 special schools also included in this programme, managed for the Department by HEAnet. Currently, my Department spends some &euro;13m on the provision of internet connectivity to schools annually. </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy is on a high speed 50mb wireless connection since the beginning of this year, which is a dedicated service to the school.  If they have not already done so, the school should contact the Schools Broadband Service Desk in the first instance, in order to rule out any issues with the internal infrastructure of the school, that may be impacting their service, be it on a wireless or wired network. The school should record their bandwidth upgrade request with the service desk at this time also. The Broadband service desk is the Department's dedicated broadband service desk which is managed by the Professional Development Service for Teachers - Technology in Education (PDST-TiE). They can be contacted by phoning 1800334466 or by emailing broadbandservicedesk@pdst.ie. </p>  <p>  This school is included in the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area Plan for which implementation is now underway, and as announced recently, the provision of high speed connectivity to the almost 700 primary schools in that area is to be accelerated for delivery by the end of 2022. My Department is engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on the intervention area implementation, including the Schools Broadband Connection Points Programme.  When the high speed infrastructure is in place for this school through the NBP, the service will be upgraded to the school through the Schools Broadband Programme.</p></reply>

The updated guidance has now been published. </p>  <p>  In terms of good ventilation practices in schools it is important, particularly as we get further into winter that we achieve an appropriate balance between good ventilation and comfort.</p>  <p>  The overall approach for schools should be to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use (for example during break-times, lunch-times and at the end of each school day) and partially open when classrooms are in use to achieve appropriate air flow.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that windows do not need to be open as wide in windy/colder weather in order to achieve the same level of airflow into the classroom.</p>  <p>  As part of managing comfort levels in classrooms, schools should check that their heating systems are set at the recommended manufacturer&rsquo;s guidance levels to maximise the available heat to the school.  In addition, heating should operate for extended periods during colder weather to counteract, as best as possible, the impact of windows being open (partially when classrooms in use and fully when not in use) in order to maintain an appropriate balance between ventilation and comfort levels.  </p>  <p>  My Department has reviewed the HPSC guidance that consideration be given to installing an indoor air quality monitor in classrooms.  The purpose of a monitor in this context is to assist in determining when windows should be opened.  It should be noted that an air monitor would not increase the air temperature in a classroom. As reflected in the updated guidance, my Department has concluded that windows are likely to be required to be open at a frequency outlined earlier to ensure appropriate levels of ventilation in the classroom irrespective of whether the opening of windows is prompted through the indoor air quality monitor (re-active approach) or through the pro-active approach outlined in the guidance. This has been agreed with the partners in education. While this matter (and supporting data) will be kept under review, my Department does not consider it necessary for schools to install such monitors in classrooms, where the practical steps outlined in the update guidance are applied. However, it is a matter for individual schools to consider whether they wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for this purpose or alternatively schools may wish to use some of their minor works grant funding for provision of permanent background ventilation, where required.</p></reply>

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.</p>  <p>  Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p>  <p>  The advisory group met on 25 November and on 14 December 2020, with a further meeting planned for later this month. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. </p>  <p>  My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. </p>  <p>  From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. </p>  <p>  The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p>  <p>  Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at www.examinations.ie/misc-doc/BI-EX-12232019.pdf. Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. </p>  <p>  The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.   </p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.  </p></reply>

These provisions including the requirement for schools to set out arrangements for students that do not wish to attend religious instruction, apply to the admission processes for the 2021/2022 school year onwards. Circular 7/2020, (Commencement of Certain Sections of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018) requires each school authority to familiarise themselves with the requirements of the act and to have in place the necessary policy, procedures and practices to ensure compliance with it. </p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools are required to have drafted new admissions policies, which have been approved by the patron, following consultation with staff and parents of children who are attending the school.  The newly revised school&rsquo;s admissions policy is published on the schools website. </p>  <p>  The manner in which any school ensures that the right to opt out of religion classes is upheld is a matter for the school concerned. Each individual school must determine the particular arrangements which are most appropriate in its individual circumstances having regard to local issues such as available space, supervision requirements and how the school concerned organises classes etc. </p></reply>

This model is based on what the research shows is effective in the application of psychology and facilitates a number of ways for psychologists to engage with schools. The needs of children and young people are met most effectively where parents, teachers and psychologist work collaboratively, consulting with each other with regard to the issue or concern. Other agencies and other staff in the school may also be involved.  This could for example include a special education teacher, SNA or personnel from the NCSE.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. </p>  <p>  NEPS encourages and supports schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.   Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p>  <p>   Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  -  Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  -  Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, since April 2018, the Government has announced plans for the establishment of 47 new schools over the 4 year period 2019 to 2022. </p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction i.e. Irish or English for their child&rsquo;s education. </p>  <p>  The timeline for delivering the permanent accommodation for a new school varies as it is subject to a range of factors such as identifying and acquiring a suitable site, designing the school and engaging with relevant local authority in preparation for an application for planning permission, planning process including in some cases appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, tendering for and constructing the school. Following the announcement of a new school and while planning and delivery of permanent accommodation for the school is progressing arrangements are made for suitable interim accommodation to be provided pending the delivery of the permanent accommodation.</p></reply>

The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports.  </p>  <p>  This policy is supported by significant investment by Government, &euro;2bn or 20% of the total education spend.  This funds the provision of additional teachers, special needs assistants and other supports required to enable children with special needs to access education. </p>  <p>  Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for.</p>  <p>  It is therefore not the case that special educational placements are required to support all children with special educational needs, nor is it intended that this should be the case. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to provide for a continuum of provision, which includes special class and special school places for children who have been assessed as needing such placements.</p>  <p>  The Department's school building programme is focused on providing the additional school places to ensure that every child, including children with special needs, has a school place. This includes opening new schools and extending existing schools in areas where more school places are needed to meet the growing number of children living in these areas.</p>  <p>  Funding is also available to schools to establish special classes within existing accommodation. Schools may apply for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces in their building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation.</p></reply>

This model has replaced the previous model of allocating resource teaching support and learning support to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>The school will take account of learning needs of children as evidenced by performance in schools but also supported where relevant by information provided regarding the nature of a condition that a pupil may have.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at www.education.ie. </p><p>The guidelines support schools in how they identify pupils for additional teaching support and decide how much support to provide for pupils who need it.  </p><p>Under the special education teacher allocation model schools are frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.</p><p>Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p><p>Children do not have to be labelled with a particular condition to qualify for extra teaching assistance.</p><p>The model gives greater freedom to schools to give extra teaching help to the pupils who most need it, regardless of their diagnosis.</p><p>Schools also do not have to give a set amount of time to pupils based on their disability category. They can give the most assistance to the pupils who need the support most and allocate resources based on needs.</p><p>Children who have additional learning needs in school, including children with Autism who are attending mainstream schools, may receive additional teaching support in schools.</p><p>However, as special education teaching support is now allocated to individual pupils at local school level, my Department does not hold details of the number of pupils with particular conditions of SEN who are supported in mainstream schools.</p><p>I can advise however, that the National Council for Special education (NCSE), an independent agency of my Department, is responsible for planning, coordinating and advising on education provision for children with special educational needs in consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p><p>The NCSE&rsquo;s policy advice on Supporting Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (2016) noted a national ASD prevalence rate of 1.55% or 1 in every 65 students. </p><p>There were 567,716 students enrolled in Primary schools and 371,450 students enrolled in Post Primary schools in the 2019/20 school year.

The Government has always been guided by public health advice in relation to what is safe in schools. NPHET remain of the view that schools are low risk environments but recognise there is a need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at this time.</p>  <p>  The Government decision, taken on 6 January, on foot of public health advice to reduce mobility in the community, was to close schools for the vast majority of students for a period of three weeks. The Government decided to prioritise in-person teaching and learning for two specific cohorts; pupils/ students attending special schools and classes and final year Leaving Certificate students. This decision was supported by the public health advice available to Government. </p>  <p>The Government has decided to pause this limited reopening for these groups scheduled for the 11 January to allow for further engagements with education partners to ensure schools can continue to operate safely. As of Monday 11 January students, including children with special needs, should be provided with a programme of remote learning.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 113,100 children, including over 14,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.</p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the 2020/21 school year where such services are in operation. The closing date for payment for the 2020/2021 school year was Tuesday 4th August 2020. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed, that the child to whom the Deputy refers is eligible for School Transport. The family first applied for School Transport on 22nd April 2018 for the 2018/19 school year. The pupil's application was rolled over by Bus &Eacute;ireann for the following years. However no payment was received from the family for the 2020/21 school year. For this reason the pupil was not issued with a ticket for the 2020/21 school year.  </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has also confirmed that 50% social distancing has been implemented on the service in question and that the service is currently operating at capacity.</p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools have been notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2020/21.  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current SNA allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process.</p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020/21 school year. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here <i>.</i></p></reply>

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations</p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on 25 November and on 14 December 2020, with a further meeting planned for later this month. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. </p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. </p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool</i>. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at <i>www.examinations.ie/misc-doc/BI-EX-12232019.pdf</i>. Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. </p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool</i>.</p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions:</p><p>-  2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school  year in the normal way.  </p><p>-  A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.  </p><p>-  The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually. Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited. The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided. However, schools with no current SNA allocation are prioritised. Schools are advised in writing once the outcome of reviews are known. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here <i>.</i></p></reply>

The guidance builds on the key messages in a range of guidance materials which were issued to schools and centres for education as they were published. Specific guidance has been published by the Department to support schools in the context of remote teaching and learning in a Covid-19 context:</p><p>Guidance on Remote Learning in a COVID-19 Context: September &ndash; December 2020; <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/a0bff-reopening-our-primary-and-special-schools/#additional-guidelines-and-procedures</i>(Department of Education, October 2020)</p><p>This has been complemented by the Department of Education Circular Letter 0074/2020 in relation to the establishment of Digital Communication, Teaching and Learning Platforms: <i>www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0074_2020.pdf.</i></p><p>This guidance is intended to assist mainstream and special primary schools as they endeavour to support teaching and learning for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) through remote teaching approaches. Key themes of the guidance include:</p><p>-  The role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN</p><p>-  Teachers and school leaders working to support pupils with SEN</p><p>-  Keeping in touch with parents and guardians</p><p>-  Keeping pupils with SEN safe in the distance learning environment</p><p>-  Resources for teachers</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will also communicate directly with schools on the range of supports available to special schools and schools with special classes. The following sets out some of the supports available:</p><p>NCSE has created a dedicated phone line for parents to get advice and support from SENOs. The SENO will provide support and advice to parents and where relevant provide specific resources e.g. behaviour strategies, NEPS well-being resources. If necessary parents can book a subsequent appointment with the SENO assigned to their child&rsquo;s school.  This new phone number is 01 603 3456 (from Monday 11 January).</p><p>For students who might be moving between schools in September 2021, SENOs will undertake structured engagement with relevant students and their families. This engagement will involve advice and support on transition strategies appropriate to the student, along with support in securing a school placement where required.</p><p>SENOs will continue to provide a series of webinars for parents of students with special education needs starting primary school in September 2021. </p><p>The NCSE has a Visiting Teacher service which provides direct support to children who are blind/visually impaired and deaf/hard of hearing and their teachers. Visiting Teachers continue to be available to provide advice and support to parents, students and teachers during this period of remote teaching and learning. Visiting Teachers will undertake structured engagement with the families of students to whom they currently provide support to. This engagement will involve an initial check in with advice on available supports and resources. In particular, the Visiting Teacher will provide support on the use of assistive technology in the home. The Visiting Teacher will agree a programme of regular engagement with the student and family as required and will remain available to respond to emerging queries over the course of remote teaching and learning. Contact details for visiting teachers are available at . If parents experience difficulties contacting their Visiting Teacher they should call 01 603 3200. </p><p>NCSE will also be releasing a brand new suite of short videos for parents.  Topics will include managing behaviour; establishing positive routines; building in movement breaks etc.</p><p>NCSE will also be updating and enhancing its range of resources for parents available at  many of which were created with specific reference to remote teaching and learning.</p></reply>

This guidance to schools was developed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders including teachers, parents and learners.  The guidance included provision to support the continuity of teaching and learning in response to the Covid-19 restrictions for those learners unable to engage with online learning.  This guidance is all available at gov.ie.</p><p>In November 2020, circular (No. 0074/2020) issued to all schools advising them of the requirement to put in place appropriate contingency measures, to include a Communication and Learning Platform, to ensure that there are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.  The circular set out the comprehensive level of supports that are in place to assist schools with this process.</p><p>Extensive support and advice for teachers and schools to provide remote learning has been, and continues to be made available through my Department&rsquo;s support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and its Technology in Education team at <i>www.pdsttechnologyineducation.ie</i>The information on this website includes a link to a dedicated PDST portal <i>www.pdst.ie/DistanceLearning</i>aimed at supporting teachers and schools in the remote learning environment. This resource includes information on popular communication and learning platforms, digital tools and resources, video conferencing, webinars to support and inspire teachers to identify good practice and a dedicated online course for teachers for remote learning. The Department&rsquo;s Education website <i>www.scoilnet.ie</i>also contains a wealth of curriculum tagged resources that can be used by teachers, students and parents to support the continuity of learning in the remote environment.</p><p>Schools can also apply to <i>www.pdst.ie/schoolsupport </i>for the assistance of a PDST advisor for tailored school support in all subject areas at Primary and Post-Primary levels including those pertaining to the use of Digital Technologies to support remote teaching, learning and assessment practices. The PDST Leadership team will also be available to support school leaders in leading remote teaching and learning process through school support, national programmes and localised networks  </p><p>As part of the &euro;210m investment programme underpinning the  implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools,  my Department provided &euro;100m in grant funding to schools to address their ICT needs during 2020. Schools were advised that they can use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure occur arising from Public Health advice owing to Covid-19 restrictions as is the current situation.  Schools can use this funding, inter alia, to acquire software applications or platforms to enable remote learning and communications, and to provide for devices to be loaned to teachers and learners in particular where needed to enable engagement with remote learning. Funding for ICT is issued directly to schools given that schools are best placed to determine the ICT needs of their school community. In addition my Department directly funds the provision of broadband connectivity for schools at a cost of some &euro;13m per annum.  School buildings will remain open to allow staff access where this is essential to facilitate remote learning.</p><p>It is important to note that digital technology is a tool to be employed by teachers to deliver the curriculum and that it is not replacing the teacher in the teaching process. Regular engagement with pupils and students, appropriate and engaging learning opportunities, assessment and constructive feedback will continue to be important elements of the education provided by teachers.  The Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate will continue to offer an advisory service to schools to support the delivery of remote learning and to provide assistance to school leaders in particular. The Inspectorate will also evaluate and report on the quality of educational provision for students and will continue to carry out its other work as set out in Circulars 40/2020 and 41/2020. </p></reply>

The Government has always been guided by public health advice in relation to what is safe in schools. NPHET remain of the view that schools are low risk environments but recognise there is a need to reduce societal activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus at this time.</p><p>The Government decision, taken on 6 January, on foot of public health advice to reduce mobility in the community, was to close schools for the vast majority of students for a period of three weeks. The Government&rsquo;s decision included prioritising in-person teaching and learning for two specific cohorts; pupils/ students attending special schools and classes and final year Leaving Certificate students. This decision was supported by the public health advice available to Government. </p><p>There has been continuous engagement with education partners on this matter since Christmas building on weekly engagement between partners and public health throughout the school year.  Despite the confirmation by Public Health that schools remain safe, unfortunately it was not proved possible to get agreement to provide in-person learning for these groups.</p><p>In these circumstances there was no alternative but to pause the limited reopening on Monday 11 January and all pupils and students, including children with special needs, will be provided with a programme of remote learning.</p><p>As a contingency measure for the possibility of partial or full school closures, in recent months my Department provided to schools a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a COVID-19 context. Those guidance materials were issued to schools and centres for education as they were published and are available at <i><i>gov.ie</i></i>. </p><p>It is crucially important that the learning of all pupils/students, especially those with special educational needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage and/or early school leaving, are supported at this time. </p><p>Special education teachers (SETs) will continue to engage with the pupils/students on their caseloads and class/subject teachers will differentiate teaching and learning in line with their pupils&rsquo;/students&rsquo; needs to minimise disruption to their learning and progression</p><p>Engagements with the Education Partners and the Department of Education continue so that solutions can be found to provide for a limited school reopening for these priority groups and a full return to school for all children at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

I am grateful for and committed to continuing this important engagement.</p><p>In terms of remote learning, updated Guidance on Continuity of Schooling: Supporting Pupils with Special Educational Needs(for mainstream primary and special schools and for post-primary schools) has also been made available by my Department. </p><p>This revised guidance advises on how schools and teachers can support continuity in the learning of pupils with special educational needs during the school closures associated with COVID-19. The guidance builds on the key messages in a range of guidance materials which were issued to schools and centres for education as they were published. Specific guidance has been published by the Department to support schools in the context of remote teaching and learning in a Covid-19 context:</p><p>Guidance on Remote Learning in a COVID-19 Context: September &ndash; December 2020  ; <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/a0bff-reopening-our-primary-and-special-schools/#additional-guidelines-and-procedures</i>(Department of Education, October 2020)</p><p>This has been complemented by the Department of Education Circular Letter 0074/2020 in relation to the establishment of Digital Communication, Teaching and Learning Platforms: <i>www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0074_2020.pdf.</i></p><p>This guidance is intended to assist mainstream and special schools as they endeavour to support teaching and learning for pupils with special educational needs through remote teaching approaches. Key themes of the guidance include:</p><p>-  The role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN</p><p>-  Teachers and school leaders working to support pupils with SEN</p><p>-  Keeping in touch with parents and guardians</p><p>-  Keeping pupils with SEN safe in the distance learning environment</p><p>-  Resources for teachers</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also communicating directly with schools on the range of supports available to special schools and schools with special classes. The following sets out some of the supports available:</p><p>-  NCSE has created a dedicated phone line for parents to get advice and support from SENOs. The SENO will provide support and advice to parents and where relevant provide specific resources e.g. behaviour strategies, NEPS well-being resources.  If necessary, parents can book a subsequent appointment with the SENO assigned to their child&rsquo;s school. This new phone number is 01 6033456.</p><p>-  For students who might be moving between schools in September 2021, SENOs will undertake structured engagement with relevant students and their families. This engagement will involve advice and support on transition strategies appropriate to the student, along with support in securing a school placement where required.</p><p>-  SENOs will continue to provide a series of webinars for parents of students with special education needs starting primary school in September 2021. </p><p>-  The NCSE has a Visiting Teacher service which provides direct support to children who are  blind/visually impaired and deaf/hard of hearing and their teachers. Visiting Teachers continue to be available to provide advice and support to parents, students and teachers during this period of remote teaching and learning. Visiting Teachers will undertake structured engagement with the families of students to whom they currently provide support to. This engagement will involve an initial check in with advice on available supports and resources. In particular, the Visiting Teacher will provide support on the use of assistive technology in the home.

My officials have an ongoing engagement with that Department on issues relating to broadband services for schools. </p>  <p>  In an effort to support students and families a process to zero rate educational websites was put in place during the first lockdown, as announced by the then Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications. I am advised that the zero rating has been maintained by a number of telecoms providers and also that there is a range of unlimited mobile data packages on offer by the market.</p>  <p>  ICT Infrastructure Grant funding of &euro;100m (in two tranches of &euro;50m) issued in 2020 to schools, with schools advised to use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure owing to Covid-19 restrictions be required. Funding for ICT is issued directly to schools given that schools are best placed to determine the ICT needs of their school community. The early provision of the 2020-2021 ICT funding is to enable schools to implement Circular 0074/2020, issued in November 2020, advising schools of the requirement to provide for the continuity of teaching and learning through utilising relevant digital communications/learning platforms to support contingency planning in the event of further public health related school closures</p>  <p>  It is recognised that in some cases a student's home broadband may present challenges for the education system in the current crisis, and that remote learning may not be appropriate or feasible for some students. With this in mind, schools have been asked to consider the needs of all students in planning their approaches to remote learning to ensure that students who may not have adequate broadband services or who may not be able to access online classes. My Department will continue to work with the education partners to support schools through the provision of relevant resources on how best to use digital and other solutions to provide continuity of learning for all students at this time.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that school buildings will remain open to allow for staff to facilitate remote learning. Teachers, SNAs and other school staff are allowed to travel to school as essential workers. </p>  <p>  My Department's Schools Broadband Access Programme provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary and post primary schools and some 98% of schools avail of this service. The Schools Broadband Programme is operated by my Department at an annual cost of some &euro;13m.</p>  <p>  All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the High Speed Broadband programme. Schools in this programme are monitored and selected for upgrade to 200 Mbp/s plus, where usage indicates this is required. The primary broadband scheme is based on locally available infrastructure accessed by the providers of the service to my Department.  My Department continues to fund the upgrade of services as improved infrastructure becomes available subject to contractual and other budgetary constraints. Some 1,800 primary schools are now on speeds of 30Mbp/s download plus. </p>  <p>  As announced recently by the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, the provision of high speed connectivity to the almost 700 primary schools in the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area is to be accelerated for delivery by the end of 2022. My Department is engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on the intervention area implementation, including the Schools Broadband Connection Points Programme.</p></reply>

The guidance builds on the key messages in a range of guidance materials which were issued to schools and centres for education as they were published. Specific guidance has been published by the Department to support schools in the context of remote teaching and learning in a Covid-19 context:</p><p>Guidance on Remote Learning in a COVID-19 Context: September &ndash; December 2020; <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/a0bff-reopening-our-primary-and-special-schools/#additional-guidelines-and-procedures</i>(Department of Education, October 2020)</p><p>This has been complemented by the Department of Education Circular Letter 0074/2020 in relation to the establishment of Digital Communication, Teaching and Learning Platforms: <i>www.education.ie/en/Circulars-and-Forms/Active-Circulars/cl0074_2020.pdf </i></p><p>This guidance is intended to assist mainstream and special primary schools as they endeavour to support teaching and learning for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) through remote teaching approaches. Key themes of the guidance include:</p><p>-  The role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN</p><p>-  Teachers and school leaders working to support pupils with SEN</p><p>-  Keeping in touch with parents and guardians</p><p>-  Keeping pupils with SEN safe in the distance learning environment</p><p>-  Resources for teachers</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will also communicate directly with schools on the range of supports available to special schools and schools with special classes. The following sets out some of the supports available:</p><p>NCSE has created a dedicated phone line for parents to get advice and support from SENOs. The SENO will provide support and advice to parents and where relevant provide specific resources e.g. behaviour strategies, NEPS well-being resources. If necessary parents can book a subsequent appointment with the SENO assigned to their child&rsquo;s school.  This new phone number is 01 603 3456 (from Monday 11 January).</p><p>For students who might be moving between schools in September 2021, SENOs will undertake structured engagement with relevant students and their families. This engagement will involve advice and support on transition strategies appropriate to the student, along with support in securing a school placement where required.</p><p>SENOs will continue to provide a series of webinars for parents of students with special education needs starting primary school in September 2021. </p><p>The NCSE has a Visiting Teacher service which provides direct support to children who are blind/visually impaired and deaf/hard of hearing and their teachers. Visiting Teachers continue to be available to provide advice and support to parents, students and teachers during this period of remote teaching and learning. Visiting Teachers will undertake structured engagement with the families of students to whom they currently provide support to. This engagement will involve an initial check in with advice on available supports and resources. In particular, the Visiting Teacher will provide support on the use of assistive technology in the home. The Visiting Teacher will agree a programme of regular engagement with the student and family as required and will remain available to respond to emerging queries over the course of remote teaching and learning. Contact details for visiting teachers are available at . If parents experience difficulties contacting their Visiting Teacher they should call 01 603 3200. </p><p>NCSE will also be releasing a brand new suite of short videos for parents.  Topics will include managing behaviour; establishing positive routines; building in movement breaks etc.</p><p>NCSE will also be updating and enhancing its range of resources for parents available at  many of which were created with specific reference to remote teaching and learning.</p></reply>

The Government has always been guided by public health advice in relation to what is safe in schools. NPHET remain of the view that schools are low risk environments but recognise there is a need to reduce activity and movement to curb the spread of the virus. Regrettably all schools will remain closed to students from Monday 11 January.</p>  <p>  In terms of what happens when a child attending school tests positive, the HSE will inform the school principal if the child was in the school in the infectious period regardless of consent.  In these circumstances the HSE will conduct a Public Health Risk Assessment with the school principal. This is usually undertaken the same day they are notified, but it may be the following day. </p>  <p>  Public Health will work with the school principal to identify the close contacts and all close contact will be informed and scheduled for testing and asked to restrict their movements. Parent/guardians will be informed if their child is a close contact.  </p>  <p>  The wider school community can be informed that the school is working with public health who are guiding the school through the actions they need to take to protect staff, pupils and the school community.  It is important to note that the response to confirmed cases or outbreaks of Covid-19 in the community or in a school is the responsibility of, and will be led and managed by, Public Health HSE. All decisions as to appropriate actions following a confirmed case or outbreak will be made by their teams in the context of a full Public Health Risk Assessment procedure.</p></reply>

These years have seen considerable research on children&rsquo;s learning and development and much societal change. Through reviews and evaluations, we have learned a lot about the successes of the curriculum as well as the challenges with the latter including curriculum overload. There have also been calls for curriculum change, including increased time for existing areas such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and Physical Education (PE). New aspects of learning such as Coding and Computational Thinking, Education about Religions and Beliefs (ERB) and Ethics, Modern Foreign Languages, as well as a greater emphasis on Well-being, have been suggested.</p>  <p>  Reviewing and redeveloping the primary curriculum </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) published the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework in February 2020. The draft framework responds to the context above and sets out a clear vision and principles &mdash; what&rsquo;s important in primary education and why &mdash; and a description, in broad terms, of what should be prioritised in children&rsquo;s learning during their primary school years. </p>  <p>  Central to developing these proposals have been the processes of:</p>  <p>-  generating and engaging with an extensive body of research   from national and international sources</p>  <p>-  working closely with schools through the Schools Forum   </p>  <p>-  deliberation   with education partners through NCCA representative structures</p>  <p>-  previous and ongoing public consultations  .</p>  <p>  Consultation on the draft framework </p>  <p>  In response to the pandemic, the NCCA re-designed the consultation on the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework which now sees it comprising two phases. Phase 1 took place from late February to December 2020 and included bilateral meetings with more than fifty organisations, a number of which were Irish-medium organisations. Phase 2 will commence in September 2021 and will prioritise engagement with teachers, school leaders, parents and, importantly, children, including school communities in the Irish-medium sector. Feedback from across the two phases of consultation will inform the finalisation of the framework which, in turn, will then guide the redevelopment of the curriculum in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  Proposals on time allocation </p>  <p>  The proposals on time allocation presented in the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework for consultation are intended to support teachers&rsquo; and schools&rsquo; work with the redeveloped curriculum. The proposed time allocations are made up of two categories:</p>  <p>  -  Minimum Curriculum Time provides a weekly time allocation for Language; Mathematics; and Well-being, and a monthly time allocation for Science and Technology Education; Social and Environmental Education; and Arts Education. </p>  <p>  -  Flexible Time is responsive to schools&rsquo; own present and future educational priorities.</p>  <p>  Three options for &lsquo;Minimum Curriculum Time&rsquo; and &lsquo;Flexible Time&rsquo; are presented in the draft framework. The options are intended to support discussion during the consultation on how time might be allocated in a redeveloped primary curriculum. A key consideration in the development of the options was that, with the exception of Well-being (PE and SPHE) and breaks and recreation, time was taken from all areas and aspects of the curriculum in order to arrive at a set of options for consideration and discussion as we think about the type of primary curriculum needed for children over the next fifteen years. Final decisions about time allocations will be made following the consultation. </p>  <p>  Primary Language Curriculum/Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile </p>  <p>  Time allocations are provided in the 1999 primary curriculum and in the Draft Primary Curriculum Framework as a practical support for teachers as they work with the different subjects in the curriculum. Like all areas of the curriculum, children&rsquo;s learning of Irish is not confined to the specific blocks of time allocated to it. For example, in the case of English-medium schools, the new Primary Language Curriculum (2019) supports the use of Irish throughout the school day by using Irish regularly as an informal means of communication in the classroom or across the school community and by teaching other subjects or aspects of other subjects through Irish using Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). CLIL, an initiative supported by the Department of Education, affords children the opportunity to learn concepts, dispositions and skills in a particular curriculum area through Irish, and to develop their confidence by using their new language skills in real contexts outside of the discrete language lesson. In fact many of the approaches supported by the curriculum support the use of Irish outside of the discrete Irish lesson, including &ndash; Second Language Learning, the Communicative Approach, Transfer of Skill, Immersion, Play, and Cross Curriculum and Disciplinary Literacy. In this way, the children will hear and speak Irish throughout the school day, beyond the Irish lesson. </p>  <p>  Children in Irish-medium schools access the full curriculum through Irish. While Irish is the working language of the school, it is recognised that it is not the language of the home for the vast majority. Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile (2019) supports Irish-medium schools to enable children to achieve advanced skills in Irish which they use throughout the school day.</p></reply>

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations</p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on 25 November and on 14 December 2020, with a further meeting planned for later this month. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. </p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. </p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</i>This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have  in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at <i>www.examinations.ie/misc-doc/BI-EX-12232019.pdf</i>. Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. </p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</i></p></reply>

On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure.

This decision was to support the overall public health objective to limit the movement of people in society while aiming to protect certain groups who would be more adversely impacted by school closure.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s decision included prioritising in-person teaching and learning for two specific cohorts; pupils/ students attending special schools and classes and final year Leaving Certificate students. This decision was supported by the public health advice available to Government. Furthermore, public health had given their commitment that testing for close contacts and contact tracing would continue to be provided to those in school settings, and that the public health arrangements that had been in place for schools prior to Christmas would continue, including the enhanced public health teams that are in place in each public health area. </p>  <p>  There has been continuous engagement with education partners on this matter since Christmas building on weekly engagements between partners and public health throughout the school year.  Despite the confirmation by Public Health that schools remain safe, unfortunately it was not proved possible to get agreement to provide in-person learning for these groups.</p>  <p>  In these circumstances there was no alternative but to pause the limited reopening on Monday 11th January and all pupils and students, including children with special needs, will be provided with a programme of remote learning.</p>  <p>  Engagements with the Education Partners and the Department of Education continue so that solutions can be found to provide a full return to school for all children at the earliest opportunity, particularly for priority cohorts. </p></reply>

Provision for such services fall to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and this is being addressed through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area. My officials have an ongoing engagement with that Department on issues relating to broadband services for schools. </p>  <p>  In an effort to support students and families a process to zero rate educational websites was put in place during the first lockdown, as announced by the then Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications. I am advised that the zero rating has been maintained by a number of telecoms providers and also that there is a range of unlimited mobile data packages on offer by the market.</p>  <p>  In the context of our school system funding for ICT is issued directly to schools as schools are best placed to determine the ICT needs of their school community and in the context of the current closures to ensure that all students are supported.</p>  <p>  ICT Infrastructure Grant funding of &euro;100m (in two tranches of &euro;50m) issued in 2020 to schools, with schools advised to use this funding to support the continuity of teaching and learning should a period of partial or full school closure owing to Covid-19 restrictions be required. The early provision of the 2020-2021 ICT funding is to enable schools to implement Circular 0074/2020, issued in November 2020, advising schools of the requirement to provide for the continuity of teaching and learning through utilising relevant digital communications/learning platforms to support contingency planning in the event of further public health related school closures</p>  <p>  It is recognised that poor access to home broadband does present challenges for the education system in the current crisis, and that remote learning may not be appropriate or feasible for some students. With this in mind, schools have been asked to consider the needs of all students in planning their approaches to remote learning to ensure that students who may not have adequate broadband services or who may not be able to access online classes. My Department will continue to work with the education partners to support schools through the provision of relevant resources on how best to use digital and other solutions to provide continuity of learning for all students at this time.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that school buildings will remain open to allow for staff to facilitate remote learning. Teachers, SNAs and other school staff are allowed to travel to school as essential workers. </p>  <p>  My Department's Schools Broadband Access Programme provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised primary and post primary schools and some 98% of schools avail of this service. The Schools Broadband Programme is operated by my Department at an annual cost of some &euro;13m.</p>  <p>  All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the High Speed Broadband programme. Schools in this programme are monitored and selected for upgrade to 200 Mbp/s plus, where usage indicates this is required. The primary broadband scheme is based on locally available infrastructure accessed by the providers of the service to my Department.  My Department continues to fund the upgrade of services as improved infrastructure becomes available subject to contractual and other budgetary constraints. Some 1,800 primary schools are now on speeds of 30Mbp/s download plus. </p>  <p>  As announced recently by the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, the provision of high speed connectivity to the almost 700 primary schools in the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area is to be accelerated for delivery by the end of 2022. My Department is engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on the intervention area implementation, including the Schools Broadband Connection Points Programme. </p></reply>

On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at . Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. </p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;.

This number excludes students who initially entered for an appeal but later withdrew their application.</p>  <p>  As a result of the process, a total of 18 increased grades were awarded to 18 individual students.   </p>  <p>  The appeals process was a process review focussed on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process.  It was not possible to appeal the information (estimated percentage mark or rank order) provided by the school.  Due to the nature of the Calculated Grades system the professional judgement of the school was outside of the appeals process.

The scrutineers will have access to the records and documentation considered in the appeals process.</p>  <p>  The closing date for application to this process was 23 October.  Applications for this stage of the appeals process were submitted by 302 candidates in respect of 900 subject results.

This view is shared by the State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations</p><p>Planning for these examinations is underway by the SEC and the Department. It is recognised that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to Covid-19. This planning work is being assisted by an advisory group of key stakeholders which has recently been reconvened. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The advisory group met on 25 November and on 14 December 2020, with a further meeting planned for later this month. The advisory group will consider all of the various issues arising in relation to the holding of the 2021 examinations, including public health considerations and appropriate contingency measures. </p><p>My Department is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the decision not to run the state examinations last summer, and the more recent decision of 7 January 2021 to close schools for up to three weeks from 11 January until 1 February. </p><p>From Monday 11 January 2021, all students, including Leaving Certificate students, are engaging in a programme of remote learning with their schools. </p><p>The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, my Department has already provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all pupils/students in a Covid-19 context. These are available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool. This documentation has been complemented by Circular 0074/2020  (Communication/Teaching &amp;amp; Learning Platform) which requires all schools to have in place appropriate contingency measures to ensure that they are prepared to continue to support teaching and learning in the event of a partial or full closure of schools arising from Public Health advice.</p><p>Last August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School. On 21 December 2020, the Department published an updated version of the publication, which includes clarifications in relation to a number of subjects. </p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures affects students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition to the above the State Examinations Commission also advised schools in December of flexibility being provided for schools and students in the arrangements for the completion and authentication of coursework and that circular is available at . Further clarifications in this regard, on foot of the most recent school closure, will shortly be issued by the SEC. </p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November state examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations were significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that were put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.</p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include &lsquo;Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education&rsquo; and &lsquo;Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers&rsquo;. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.

This guidance includes best practice on age and stage appropriate resources and supports and schools have been advised to develop their own plans, based on this guidance, to support students&rsquo; learning in this period. Those guidance materials were issued to schools and centres for education as they were published and are available at gov.ie.</p>  <p>  There has been a huge increase in the ability and skill level in this area, with enormous take-up by teachers and school leaders of the training and resources offered by my Department and its agencies. In addition, significant additional resources have been provided to schools to help support the provision of ICT equipment and to prioritise the needs of students that do not otherwise have access to ICT. 100 million euro was provided to schools for the purpose of purchasing of IT equipment. Schools are showing commitment to supporting the student body with remote learning, via ICT where possible and using other methods where not. </p>  <p>  As part of this guidance schools were advised to research various digital platforms for facilitating communication between teachers and pupils and supporting pupils learning remotely. Schools should use the most appropriate whole-school approach for their context. In some schools, the use of digital communication platforms may not be appropriate or possible for some pupils.</p>  <p>  It is crucially important that the learning of all pupils/students, especially those with special educational needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage and/or early school leaving, are supported at this time. </p>  <p>  Special education teachers (SETs) should continue to engage with the pupils/students on their caseloads and class/subject teachers should differentiate teaching and learning in line with their pupils&rsquo;/students&rsquo; needs to minimise disruption to their learning and progression</p></reply>

I am grateful for and committed to continuing this important engagement.</p><p>Updated Guidance on Continuity of Schooling: Supporting Pupils with Special Educational Needs (for mainstream primary and special schools and for post-primary schools) has also been made available by my Department. </p><p>This revised guidance advises on how schools and teachers can support continuity in the learning of pupils with special educational needs during the school closures associated with COVID-19. The guidance builds on the key messages in a range of guidance materials which were issued to schools and centres for education as they were published. Specific guidance has been published by the Department to support schools in the context of remote teaching and learning in a Covid-19 context:</p><p>Guidance on Remote Learning in a COVID-19 Context: September &ndash; December 2020; <i></i>(Department of Education, October 2020)</p><p>This has been complemented by the Department of Education Circular Letter 0074/2020 in relation to the establishment of Digital Communication, Teaching and Learning Platforms: <i></i></p><p>This guidance is intended to assist mainstream and special schools as they endeavour to support teaching and learning for pupils with special educational needs through remote teaching approaches. Key themes of the guidance## include:</p><p>- The role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN</p><p>- Teachers and school leaders working to support pupils with SEN</p><p>- Keeping in touch with parents and guardians</p><p>- Keeping pupils with SEN safe in the distance learning environment</p><p>- Resources for teachers.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also communicating directly with schools on the range of supports available to special schools and schools with special classes. The following sets out some of the supports available: </p><p>- NCSE has created a dedicated phone line for parents to get advice and support from SENOs. The SENO will provide support and advice to parents and where relevant provide specific resources e.g. behaviour strategies, NEPS well-being resources. If necessary, parents can book a subsequent appointment with the SENO assigned to their child&rsquo;s school.  This new phone number is 01 603 3456 (from Monday,11 January) </p><p>I would like to reiterate my Department&rsquo;s commitment to continue to engage with the partners in education with the goal of providing an urgent return to school for these cohorts of children. </p></reply>

All decisions taken in relation to schools are based on current public health advice. The welfare of students and that of their families is front and centre in all decision making.</p><p>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department is leading on supporting the wellbeing of schools communities. The response to support the wellbeing of all within school communities requires a structured, psychosocial response which is compassionate and largely preventative and proactive.  This requires a whole-school team approach to planning in order to ensure that staff, students and parents feel safe and secure.  This response is aligned with the HSE guidance on such responses, and based on the five key principles of promoting a sense of safety, calm, connectedness, self- and community-efficacy and hope.  </p><p>NEPS psychologists continue to provide a service to schools via remote access.  All psychologists have been asked to continue to maintain contact with their assigned schools during this period of school closure.<b></b>NEPS psychologists will continue with elements of case work deemed necessary which will be managed remotely to support the learning and wellbeing of children and young people. With the support of schools, this can include: </p><p>- Consultation with teachers and/or teachers and parents (by telephone/on secure on-line platform)</p><p>- Completion of various checklists and measures used to evaluate the needs of children and young people (by telephone/on secure on-line platform)</p><p>- Onward referral to other services</p><p>- Input into Student Support Plans/Reviews (by telephone/on secure on-line platform)</p><p>- Feedback to teachers and/or parents (by telephone/on secure on-line platform)</p><p>- Completion and issuing of written reports</p><p>NEPS will continue to signpost schools to resources and supports for wellbeing that have been made available by NEPS and the Department&rsquo;s other support services. The resources to support students and parents will be re-circulated and promoted directly via social media over the coming period. NEPS will also continue to provide support to schools in the event of a critical incident.  </p><p>Resources to support the wellbeing of school communities when schools are closed have been revised by NEPS, and include the following for exam students and teachers and parents/guardians supporting students:  </p><p>Students</p><p>- Advice for young people while schools are closed</p><p>- A Plan for the Day &ndash; A template to support daily routines</p><p>- Managing Stress and Anxiety &ndash; a guide for students</p><p>- Panic attacks &ndash; a guide for students</p><p>Teachers</p><p>- The response to stress information for school staff</p><p>- Normalising thoughts feelings and behaviour &ndash; a guide for school staff</p><p>- Guidelines for Teachers - Listen, Connect, Model &amp;amp; Teach (This guide has been developed to enable teachers  to talk in a comforting and supportive way with students who may need the support of the Student Support Team at this time</p><p>- Managing Stress and Anxiety in students &ndash; A Guide for School Staff</p><p>Parents</p><p>- A Guide for Parents on supporting children and young people with daily routines while schools are closed</p><p>- How to Calm and Support your Child &ndash; A Guide for Parents and Guardians</p><p>- Managing Stress and Anxiety - A Guide for Parents and Guardians </p><p>My Department will continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE/HSE-funded e-mental health services. The Department of Health and HSE have ensured the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for young people. The stepped care approach recognises that at present, there already exists services that offer online text and telephone supports to people seeking mental health information and advice. </p><p>These include the Samaritans; Pieta House; MyMind; Turn2Me; Aware; Crisis Text Ireland; Shine; BeLongTo; LGBT Ireland; Jigsaw; Bodywhys and Childline. The YourMentalHealth.ie website provides a &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; portal for people seeking information, supports and services, including information on accessing urgent help and a mental health text messaging support service which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers.</p><p>Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, which is calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  Counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. The Guidance Counsellor is key in developing and implementing innovative approaches to wellbeing promotion on a whole schools basis though the school&rsquo;s Guidance Plan.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-13a.1556.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021011300075#WRX05500"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, and based on experience from past recessions, youth employment tends to be disproportionately impacted by any labour market shock.  This is because many employers operate a "last in-first out" protocol when reducing their labour force and also because young people tend to work in occupations and sectors such as retail and hospitality, for example, that are most immediately affected by economic downturns.  The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on youth unemployment has been no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  Youth unemployment stood at just over 10% in Q1 2020 based on the Labour Force Survey data, with approximately 20,000 persons aged under 25 on the Live Register.  By Q3 2020 these figures had increased to 20% and 25,000 respectively.  If PUP recipients at the end of December are included, just under 45% of young people in the labour force were unemployed at that stage. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Government extended access to PUP to students who worked part-time.  Of those under 25s in receipt of PUP, almost one quarter have self-certified as students. Using internationally recognised standards set by the International Labour Organisation, these students would not normally be considered, or counted, as unemployed.</p>  <p>  While the employment of young people is significantly affected by the pandemic, we also know from past recessions that youth unemployment levels typically fall quite quickly once economic activity resumes.  In addition, the jobs of many persons currently on PUP will not be permanently lost due to the pandemic. Many will return to previous employment once restrictions ease, as they did during previous easing of restrictions during 2020.  </p>  <p>  However, others will require assistance and support to return to employment, reskill and to find new jobs.  My Department is supporting initiatives to assist  people, including young people, get back to work, once COVID restrictions and their impact on the economy and labour market begin to ease. Under the July Jobs Stimulus, my Department, along with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, are putting in place the following measures:</p>  <p>  - Expanding the caseload capacity of Intreo Centres during Q1 2021 with the assignment of 100 job coaches to provide enhanced employment services and supports. Case officer support to help people with job search advice and assistance is shown to be the most effective means of helping people move into employment. </p>  <p>  - Extending the current contracts of existing contracted public employment service providers into 2021. In particular, the Local Employment Service is being extended into four new areas and the capacity of the service increased by 50%. </p>  <p>  - Expanding the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people.  Under this scheme an employer receives the JobsPlus subsidy of &euro;7,500 once they employ a young person (under 30 years of age) who has been unemployed for just 4 months. A higher subsidy of &euro;10,000 is paid for recruitment of a person who was long term unemployed (over 12 months).  This will help make it more attractive to recruit young people who face difficulties in securing a footing in employment. </p>  <p>  - Providing access to additional full-time and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses, with over 35,000 new education and training places for those currently unemployed.</p>  <p>  - Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited until June 2021.</p>  <p>  - Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those displaced by the pandemic by waiving the usual qualifying period of 3-9 months. My Department will actively promote this scheme to suitable candidates and although it is not budget capped, additional provision has been made in Budget 2021 of &euro;3.5million &ndash; equivalent to an extra 700 places.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, building on the success of the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS), my Department is at an advanced stage in developing a new work placement experience programme for those out of work for at least six months. This programme will seek to encourage businesses  provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market and to help break the vicious circle of &ldquo;no job without experience, no experience without a job&rdquo;.  There is a target of over 10,000 persons, regardless of age, to be placed on this six-month scheme by end of this year. I expect to launch the Programme  as soon as public health restrictions allow in 2021.</p>  <p>  Work is also at an advanced stage by my Department to develop Pathways to Work, the national employment services strategy for the period 2021-2025. The strategy will seek to build upon those support measures outlined above as we assist young people on their journey to work.  Publication is expected in early 2021, following the launch of the Government's National Economic Plan.</p>  <p>  In developing these programmes and services the Department is working closely with, and being advised by, the Labour Market Advisory Council which is composed of leading market experts, representatives of industry and workers and representatives of unemployed people.  We will keep these programmes under review and report progress on a regular basis.</p></reply>

There are no plans to change this status of CE supervisors. The Department&rsquo;s role continues to be that of CE funder. </p><p>This issue was examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p><p>As part of this process a detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p><p>In its findings, the High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors could potentially give rise to claims for funding for employees in the broader sector.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that it had to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent when dealing with the specific issue as regards CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendation.. </p><p>At this point, I wish to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes delivering local based community services while providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.</p><p>The current position is that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing the CE Supervisors continue to engage in discussions and I am hopeful that, with goodwill and flexibility on all sides, a resolution can be found in the near future.</p><p>The Deputy should note that funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will ultimately be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context in which any such scheme will need to operate.  <b></b></p><p>Nevertheless I, and my colleague the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform are keen to find an approach that will resolve this issue in the near future. </p></reply>

Budget 2021 has provided an additional &euro;5.5m for this extension from January 2021 to 35,000 primary school children currently receiving the cold lunch option. </p>  <p>  According to information contained on the Department of Educations and Skills website there are 3,240 primary schools and 723 secondary schools with a combined enrolment of 939,166 students (567,716 in primary schools and 371,450 in secondary schools). </p>  <p>  There are 2,289 primary schools with a total enrolment of 406,654 students and 446 post primary schools with a total enrolment of 251,516 students that do not benefit from the scheme.  If a breakfast/snack at 60c per child, per day, and a lunch at &euro;1.40 per child, per day, were to be made available to all students in these schools, it would cost approximately &euro;229m (&euro;146m for primary schools and &euro;83m for secondary schools) for a full school year.</p>  <p>  Any extension of the scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>I trust that this clarifies the position.   </p></reply>

Participation limits on these schemes are necessary to allow for the maximum utilisation of places amongst qualifying persons. It is important to note that participation is intended to be for a temporary fixed term and the positions offered are not full-time sustainable jobs. Instead, the placements are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the open labour market. </p>  <p>  Participation on CE is for a maximum of three consecutive years though a person may re-qualify after a 12 month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment).  </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to continuing to enhance the effectiveness of the CE Programme and is conscious of the valuable contribution it is making in the provision of services to individuals and communities across Ireland. In light of the current Level 5 restrictions it has been decided that CE participants who are due to leave their schemes in January, February and March can remain on CE until the 26th March, 2021.</p>  <p>  If any scheme is experiencing particular difficulties filling CE vacancies, they should contact their local DSP Intreo office who will facilitate the referral process.</p></reply>

Once awarded, WFP is payable for 52 weeks from the date of award at a fixed weekly rate. At the end of the 52 week award period, a person must submit a new application for reassessment. In order to satisfy the qualifying and continued entitlement condition for receipt of WFP, a claimant must be engaged in fulltime remunerative employment as an employee for not less than 38 hours per fortnight. </p>  <p>  In cases where existing WFP claimants lose their employment on a temporary basis or their hours of employment temporarily reduce below the required limit for receipt of WFP due to the impact of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, their existing WFP payment  has continued in payment. Where a claimant qualifies for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, payment of WFP is not affected once the person meets the eligibility conditions of both payments.</p>  <p>  My officials have analysed the instances of disallowances both pre and post Covid-19 and there has been no increase in the number of WFP applications being disallowed since the onset of the pandemic.  As would be expected, the downturn in economic activity caused by the Covid pandemic has resulted in a significant reduction in new WFP applications received since March 2020. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

As part of its free services, MABS also provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears, and administers the Abhaile service.</p><p>Since the restructuring of the governance arrangements of the 51 local MABS into eight regional companies in October 2018, funding and resources are distributed on a regional basis. Each MABS regional company is overseen by a voluntary Board, which aims to ensure that the provision of, and access to, MABS is consistent and fair across the entire region. </p><p>Under this model, all clients in a region have access to all the resources of the entire region and can contact any money advisor in that region about their case by phone, email, online chat or through video conferencing.</p><p>In relation to funding and resources, the table below sets out the budget allocation for each of the eight regional MABS companies in 2021. Approximately 90% of each budget allocation corresponds to approved staffing allocations and premises footprints, which varies from each regional company to another, based on their size and demographic reach. The remainder (10%) consists of administrative costs that are common to all regional companies, for example, travel and subsistence, professional fees and training and these are consistent across all services and regions. <table>    <tr>       <th>MABS Regional Company </th>       <th>Budget Allocation 2021 <br /><br />&euro;</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MABS Operating Grants - North Dublin</td>       <td>2,679,553</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MABS Operating Grants - Dublin South</td>       <td>2,882,701</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MABS Operating Grants - North Connacht &amp;amp; Ulster</td>       <td>1,875,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MABS Operating Grants - South Connacht</td>       <td>1,454,607</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MABS Operating Grants - South Munster</td>       <td>2,006,037</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MABS Operating Grants - North Munster</td>       <td>2,280,275</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MABS Operating Grants - North Leinster</td>       <td>1,852,887</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MABS Operating Grants - South Leinster</td>       <td>2,102,037</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Allocation</td>       <td>&euro;17,133,097</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Therefore, the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on this particular case. </p>  <p>  However, in general terms, the following are important points to note.</p>  <p>  The Widow's, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) pension is paid to the husband, wife or surviving civil partner of a deceased person and is available to those who satisfy the necessary PRSI contribution conditions, either on their own record or on that of the deceased spouse or civil partner, provided the applicant is not cohabiting.  </p>  <p>  The legal context governing relationships such as marriage or civil partnership is regulated by the Minister for Justice.  Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties that do not exist in law between cohabiting couples.  Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners, who become bereaved, therefore, lose someone who had legal duties towards them, and the social welfare code recognises this by providing a pension to them, subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  It was for these reasons that the social welfare supports for widows and widowers were extended to surviving civil partners from 1 January 2011, when the provisions of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 came into force.</p>  <p>  Awarding widows pensions, or a similar benefit, to people who are not legally widows, widowers or surviving civil partners would involve a significant income support policy change and could also be very costly.  The basis on which a person would become entitled to such a pension, would require significant consideration and raise complex challenges.  Accordingly, any changes to eligibility criteria for widow's pension would need to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Addressing barriers to this forms part of Government policy on gender equality and requires a range of policy solutions.</p>  <p>  We know that the burden of childcare in working families falls predominantly on women, and can be a barrier to their full participation in the workforce. The Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 introduced 2 weeks' paid, non-transferrable leave to both parents in the first year of their child's life to ensure that fathers as well as mothers are supported in spending time with their child in his or her earliest years. I will introduce a Bill early in 2021 which will extend Parent's Leave and Benefit to five weeks for each parent, and the period in which it can be taken to two years.</p>  <p>  I will also bring forward Government amendments to progress the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019. This Bill, when passed, will oblige companies over a certain size to publish information on their gender pay gap. It is hoped that transparency around this important subject will build awareness within companies and the wider public of the gender pay gap and to take steps to address the gender pay parity. </p>  <p>  The National Strategy for Women and Girls includes a series of actions to promote equality for women, including mothers, in the workplace.  These Strategy is a whole-of-Government strategy which involves actions by relevant Government Departments to advance women's equality, including in the workplace. </p></reply>

The schemes objectives are to promote (i) a reduction in child poverty, (ii) positive child development outcomes, (iii) labour market activation and (iv) improved quality.  </p><p>The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children. </p><p>By making this fundamental shift away from the legacy schemes where subsidies are grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children's outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty. It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty trap.</p><p>Within this framework, an income-related subsidy is payable for children up to 15 years of age. The subsidy level is determined by the family's income and the child's age. The number of hours subsidised is determined by the parent's employment or education arrangements.</p><p>The standard hours available are up to a maximum of 20 hours per week and children are eligible if at least one parent or guardian is not in work, education or training.</p><p>The enhanced hours available are up to a maximum of 45 hours per week where both of a child's parents or guardians are in work, education or training.</p><p>The NCS acknowledges that childcare needs differ widely across families and offering subsidies at an hourly rate allows for flexible childcare arrangements to be made based on parental needs. </p><p>With regard to the specific questions raised:</p><p>- 568 school age children have received the NCS standard hours award since September 2020.</p><p>- 12,080 school age children have received NCS enhanced hours since September 2020.</p></reply>

It is not possible to readily identify children who are attending school as well as childcare, so the purpose of this query, the number of children over 4 is used as a proxy for school aged children, as this is the age from which children are able to start school.</p>  <p>  In relation to Community Childcare Subvention Plus (CCSP), 21,754 children over 4 were registered  from September 2019 to December 2019 and 10,554 children over 4 were subject to a renewed CCSP application from September 2020 to December 2020.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the take up of school aged childcare between September 2019 and September 2020 are dropped sharply, due to the  impact of Covid-19.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-01-13a.1734.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021011300078#WRAA00600"><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme (TWSCS) was expediently launched on 15 April 2020 as a unique sector specific response to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. This scheme was in addition to the Revenue led Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS)  made available to other sectors. </p>  <p>  The TWSCS supported approximately 3,855 or 85% of early learning and childcare services and ensured that over 22,000 staff in the sector retained their employment relationship with their employer. The 12-week scheme is estimated to cost approximately &euro;50m.</p>  <p>   While the unique 12 week scheme was being developed, preliminary payments were paid in advance to providers to assist their cash flow, enable them to retain their staff and cover some of their overhead costs. These preliminary/estimated payments resulted in some surplus funding being provided.</p>  <p>  It was noted from the outset of the scheme, a reconciliation would take place between the final calculated amount actually due to providers and the preliminary payments that were made.</p>  <p>  These reconciliations arise from &ldquo;preliminary&rdquo; payments which were made in April, May and June 2020 to ensure that providers received funding in a timely manner to enable them pay their staff and avoid laying them off, and cover some of their overhead costs. They were based on estimates of each individual service&rsquo;s staff and overhead requirements, in advance of the more detailed TWSCS subsidy calculations. </p>  <p>  The alternative for Pobal and DCYA would have been to await the detailed application form and verification, but this would have delayed payments and could have been detrimental to providers with serious income and cash flow difficulties caused by the COVID-19 closure.</p>  <p>  Providers are able to view details of the TWSCS overpayments on the providers platform on Pobal's IT system PIP.  The TWSCS contract value is provided, along with the amount paid, resulting in a balance due. However, should providers have concerns in relation to the overpayment amounts shown, or require further detail, they should contact the provider centre in the first instance to highlight and address their concerns.</p>  <p>  Many services had the excess amount in their accounts and were in a position to repay it. In fact several providers expressed a wish to return the excess funding immediately and have done so in advance of  the recoupment process which commenced in November 2020. Refunds of overpayments continue to be made to Pobal by providers in January 2021. </p>  <p>  For providers who did not have funds on hand at the time and therefore were unable to refund the excess funding immediately, an alternative arrangement was put in place. The deduction of the overpayment was spread over the remaining Programme payments from the 20 November to the end of 2020. However, my department acknowledged that, despite the wide ranging Covid-19 supports available to date, there may be some providers who may continue to experience ongoing viability concerns and this alternative arrangement may not them suit at that time. In such cases, my Department put a third option in place. My Department asked and indeed encouraged any provider who had concerns to register a service request on Hive. The provider would be contacted by Pobal and an opportunity for an alternative plan would be discussed. </p>  <p>  Providers were given an opportunity make final amendments to their subsidy application form in November 2020. Any changes made to the application form in the amendment window would result in a recalculation of the 12 week subsidy. Any recalculation of the TWSCS subsidy may result in the overpayment amount being adjusted. </p>  <p>  The final 12 week subsidy recalculation was run in early December. Pobal are now in the process of completing recalculation process and adjusting overpayments amounts to be repaid if necessary, for the providers who made adjustments to their application form. It is anticipated the recalculation process will  be finalised in the coming weeks as Pobal continue to make the final Revenue and quality assurance checks as required. </p>  <p>  As stated previously, Pobal recognises the immense pressure that services have been under and is committed to continuing to work with the Department and the sector to support it through these exceptionally difficult times.</p>  <p>  The measures put in place to support the ELC and SAC sector since March 12 have been very successful including the TWSCS and the EWSS. Approximately the same number of services have reopened in late 2020 as were open in late 2019, despite reports that up to 1,000 would close. This is a phenomenal result and reflects both the effectiveness of the Government measures and the hard work of the sector. </p></reply>

The programme is provided for three hours per day, five days per week, over 38 weeks per year. A child must have reached 2 years and 8 months of age on or prior to 31 August of the relevant programme year to be eligible for the September start date and a child cannot turn 5 years and 6 months of age during the course of the ECCE programme year.

Due to the age of the children referred to, they will only be eligible for one year of ECCE, due to their age. It is currently open to parents in this situation to apply for an overage exemption to avail of a ECCE second year. The Department in deciding such applications is guided by expert advice that it is in children's best interests to start primary school with their age cohort.</p>  <p>  It is not possible for the Department to approve an overage exemption for September 2022 based on a speech therapists report of March 2020.</p></reply>

Here, a parent can select their currently-active application and select the refresh button to begin the renewal process.</p>  <p>  It appears based on the new information provided that the applicant opted to commence a new application rather than renew their existing award. As one family obviously cannot have two active awards, when an applicant receives a new award, this will invalidate their current NCS award at the end of the week.

A 117% increase in investment over the last number of years has led to a doubling in the number of children receiving free or subsidised early learning and care and school-age childcare. It has also supported the sector to increase the number of places available &ndash; by up to 60 percent.</p><p>First 5, the ten-year whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families pledges to build on this progress. Among key strategic actions in First 5 is a commitment to 'maintain and extend the supply of high-quality publicly subsidised early learning and care and school-age childcare to best serve the developmental needs of babies and young children, ensuring that it also reflects the needs and preferences of parents and families'. </p><p>To deliver on this strategic action, a range of actions are under way, including an update of the National Planning Guidelines for the development of early learning and care and school-age childcare settings, the extension of regulation to all paid, non-relative childminders on a phased basis and  the development of a strategic capital investment plan to deliver large-scale capital investment under Project 2040. There is also a commitment to strengthen capacity to accurately forecast supply and demand for early learning and care and school-age childcare.</p><p>Supply of, and demand for, early learning and care and school-age childcare places is currently monitored annually through the Early Years Sector Profile. This survey is conducted by Pobal on behalf of my Department.</p><p>The most recent published report of findings from this survey is on 2019 data. This reveals that the current supply of early learning and care and school-age childcare broadly meets parental demand. However, there is some evidence of capacity issues in certain areas and for certain age groups. </p><p>The following table shows the capacity in County Monaghan. <table>    <tr>       <th>County</th>       <th>Children enrolled</th>       <th>Vacant places</th>       <th>Waiting List</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>3,925</td>       <td>257</td>       <td>211</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>There are currently 58 early learning and care and school-age childcare services in Monaghan that are in contract with my Department.

EWSS is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees.

While no environment is without risk in relation to Covid-19, and this has been the case throughout the pandemic, services can significantly reduce their risk level by closely following the expert guidance provided by the HSE, which was prepared specifically for ELC and SAC services by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). It is also important to remember that the incidence of Covid-19 positive cases in children under 13 remains significantly lower than the population at large.</p>  <p>  The Government decided to delay the reopening of schools until 1 February in order to minimise the movement of people at a time of significantly elevated levels of infection of Covid-19 in the community. The decision is not connected to the risk level of the setting (e.g. Schools or ELC/SAC services) but rather due to the Government's desire to reduce all movement of people in so far as possible, and so reduce the chance of the virus spreading. For this reason the reopening of the ECCE programme has been postponed until 1 February, and ELC/SAC services will only be open to children of essential workers and vulnerable children. </p>  <p>  The advice from the national public health experts is that no change is required to the Infection Prevention and Control guidance for settings providing ELC/SAC during the pandemic. Services have been following this guidance effectively since reopening last June and it has helped to minimise risk of spread of infection within settings.  My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, will keep this under review and will update as appropriate.</p></reply>

As has been advised to service providers and set out in the TWSCS Funding Agreement last April, it is a requirement of the TWSCS that unspent or excess monies are recouped. </p><p>As per communications to service providers regarding the treatment of TWSCS overpayments, the options to repay overpayments were outlined as follows:</p><p>- to repay the amount by 13/11/2020</p><p>- to request an alternative recoupment plan such as recoupment from other programme payments up to the end of March 2021 at the latest </p><p>If neither of the options were requested the default scenario was to recover from programme payments before the end of December 2020.</p><p>The Department has been in contact with the scheme administrator (Pobal), who have advised that they have no record of receiving any TWSCS refund payment from the service. As a result the overpayments which are showing as due have been fully recouped against programme payments per the original agreement and as flagged to all providers in September and November.</p><p>The scheme administrator has attempted to contact the provider on foot of the Deputy's PQ, but has been unable to make contact.

The cost of delivering such programmes has not reduced as a consequence of the pandemic indeed institutions have had a range of additional costs in continuing to deliver programmes despite the unique circumstances of the pandemic. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our students. In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students the Government approved once off funding of &euro;50m to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year. The funding, which was provided in Budget 2021, in recognition of the significant upheaval they have experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic offers &euro;250 in financial assistance to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions.</p>  <p>  This builds on the previously enhanced student supports provided in response to COVID-19, including the  doubling of the Student Assistance Fund and the provision of &euro;15m in funding for laptops and devices. In addition to the once off &euro;250 funding for full time postgraduate students, the main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme. To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression. Postgraduate students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible for a maintenance grant of up to &euro;5,915. Qualifying postgraduate students may also be eligible to have their tuition fees paid up to a maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270. Alternatively, a postgraduate student may qualify to have a &euro;2,000 contribution made towards the cost of his/her fees. </p>  <p>  In line with the strategic direction set out for the Review of SUSI, Budget 2021 announced the following enhanced supports for postgraduate grants - increase the fee grant to &euro;3,500 from &euro;2,000 from September 2021. This increase will allay some of the costs for postgraduate study and would give greater certainty for students in terms of supports.</p>  <p>  There are initiatives across a number of Government Departments to facilitate broadband connection through community-based broadband hubs and liaison with telecommunication providers on packages, including unlimited data. It is also worth noting that, HEAnet provides a WiFi solution - Eduroam - designed by and for the higher education community which operates across the education locations nationally. Eduroam allows a student to access WiFi wherever Eduroam is broadcast, enabling a student to seamlessly roam from one Eduroam location to another. On 5th  January I announced the roll out of Wi-Fi roaming to further and higher education students in over 90 new locations across the country in 2021. This initiative will aim to create extended virtual campuses and offer students multiple options to go online.</p></reply>

I will continue to liaise with the USI and have met regularly with the President of the USI including on one occasion in 2020 specifically in relation to the USI's Education for All Campaign and most recently on 11<sup>th</sup>January to discuss a range of issues of concern to students.</p><p>Significant additional Exchequer funding of appropriate student supports has been a key feature of the Government&lsquo;s approach to date not least in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic. In this context I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 41789 of 8 December 2020. For example, it is important to note in relation to this issue that under the Free Fees Schemes the Exchequer currently makes a very substantial contribution amounting to &euro;340m to meeting the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate Higher Education students with those students who are required to pay the student contribution paying &euro;3,000 per annum towards the cost of their studies. </p><p>In addition, the Exchequer pays the contribution in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students eligible for free fees.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware as part of Budget 2021, I announced enhanced SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increased support for the PATH access initiative to increase participation in Higher Education from the most economically disadvantaged students and a review of SUSI to guide the future strategic direction of the scheme. An important objective will be to ensure access to and continued participation in higher education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p><p>While the balance of costs and benefits of Higher Education will be considered as part of the broader strategic reform of higher education funding, the impact of the Covid 19 pandemic on students and families has been the subject of immediate attention.  </p><p>In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students the Government has approved once off funding of &euro;50m to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year. </p><p>The funding, which was provided in Budget 2021, in recognition of the significant upheaval they have experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic will offer financial assistance to all EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions (HEI).</p><p>The scheme will ensure students;</p><p>- Who avail of the SUSI grant will receive an additional &euro;250  payment before Christmas;</p><p>- Students who do not avail of the grant but attend publicly funded Higher Education Institutions in the state can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution;</p><p>- In a small number of cases, alternative arrangements will be made for the payment of the monies to students.</p><p>The latter two options, as outlined above, are designed to ensure students who are not in receipt of SUSI benefit from the measure. It is also the intention that these address circumstances where students are in final year, have paid their contribution fee and may not be on campus.</p><p>A key administrative feature of the fund is that it is being implemented with the assistance of publicly funded institutions in the State under the remit of my Department. SUSI and Higher education institutions are in the process of communicating with students on the specific arrangements for disbursement of funds/credits. Information from SUSI is available here: </p><p>This builds on the specific student supports in response to Covid, which I announced in July including the provision of additional student assistance including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund, and a &euro;15 million technology fund for devices for students in further and higher education to assist with difficulties in accessing technology to facilitate their course work in a blended capacity.  These supports are being distributed through the colleges and further education providers.</p><p>In relation to the Student Grant and in line with the Programme for Government, I recently announced plans to review the SUSI scheme.  The review will commence as soon as consultants are in place. The contract for an external consultant/researcher was published by the Office of Government Procurement on December 18<sup>th</sup>and the closing date for tender submissions is January 15<sup>th</sup>2021. Stakeholders, including USI, will be consulted as part of the review process and it is intended that the future direction of the SUSI scheme will be guided by the outcome of the review. </p><p>The specific issues comprehended in the USI Education for All Campaign will continue to be considered by the Department and, where appropriate, advanced and resourced in the context of ongoing engagement with relevant stakeholders in higher education and against the backdrop of significant cumulative pressures on the public finances at this time.</p></reply>

As a result of the decision to minimise on-site teaching, all universities have confirmed that students who opted to leave their university-owned student accommodation as a result reduced on-campus activity will be offered refunds or rental credits. The processing of these refunds is a matter for the universities themselves, and any student who wishes to receive a refund for their on-campus accommodation should engage directly with their university&rsquo;s accommodation office. </p>  <p>  In relation to the University of Limerick specifically I have been informed that students were given until 31st October to cancel their accommodation and receive a full refund. Students who chose to leave their accommodation after 31st October due to the remote format of the academic year have been offered a rental fee credit. I will continue to liaise with the sector through the Irish Universities Association to encourage the availability of fair solutions to students in university-owned student accommodation. </p>  <p>  However this applies only to accommodation owned by the universities themselves. In the case of privately-owned student accommodation, I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances that students find themselves.  There are, however, no powers available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action.  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.  In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached. If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board.</p>  <p>  I have asked my officials to continue to engage with the sector and to keep me updated on relevant  developments in this important area.</p></reply>

In particular PhD students, in addition to conducting research, participate in other activities to develop generic and transferable skills. These activities are regarded as an integral part of their training and typically include teaching. </p>  <p>  Development of these skills is important in equipping the students for their future careers, including those who wish to compete for academic positions. Teaching contribution assists in the acquisition of generic and transferable skills, as described in the National Framework for Doctoral Education and the PhD Graduate Skills statement provided by the Irish Universities Association. </p>  <p>  PhD students may contribute to teaching, often at a level of up to 5 hours per week over the course of their studies, without extra payment. Such duties are commonly part of their terms and constitute an important element of their skills development programme. A range of activities can be included under the teaching contribution, such as taking tutorial groups, demonstrating at practical classes, co-supervising undergraduate projects and student mentoring. Hours may be included that are spent in class preparation, advising, monitoring student projects, and correcting projects, notebooks or essays and will vary according to School/Discipline.  Where postgraduate students are in receipt of funding awards, participation in such activities can be considered a valuable activity within the award holder&rsquo;s career. </p>  <p>  While contributing to teaching is an integral part of the training of a research Master&rsquo;s or PhD student the core component of research programmes across all universities is the advancement of knowledge through original research, which must remain the primary focus of the activity of research students.  </p>  <p>  The delivery of teaching duties by graduate students in a higher education institution is a matter for the institution concerned reflecting their independent self-governed status. However, it is important that the allocation and conduct of such work is undertaken in accordance with the objectives of the National Framework for Doctoral Education and the PhD Graduate Skills Statement in enabling the development of key skills and competencies for postgraduate students.  </p>  <p>  Where individual issues arise these fall to individual institutions to address consistent with the terms of the Framework and Skills Statement. However given the wide range of potential situations reflecting the diversity of institutions, disciplines, course fees, the relationship in some cases with research funding awards and stipends and other factors, I have asked my Department to engage with the Higher Education Authority, research funders and relevant stakeholders to seek advice on this matter and consider any issues arising.</p></reply>

Level 5 measures designate higher and further education as essential insofar as onsite presence is required and such education activities cannot be held remotely.

This includes the consideration of issues around work placements for students. The national co-ordination group for further and higher education is also meeting on a regular basis, and is closely monitoring the impact that Covid-19 is having on third level institutions and their students.</p>  <p>  Since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, both the higher education, and further education and training sectors, have worked proactively to ensure that appropriate and robust contingencies have been agreed and implemented in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders including Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI), enabling the continuation of teaching and learning.  QQI are also engaging with professional and statutory bodies regarding their work placement requirements for relevant programmes. </p>  <p>  The further education and training (FET) sector has responded swiftly to the identified issues of work placement and work practice by putting together a series of contingency proposals to QQI for the current academic year.  These arrangements will be kept in place for all learners seeking to complete awards for this academic period, while maintaining the integrity of the award standards at all times.</p>  <p>  As Higher Education Institutions are autonomous, and as such are academically independent and are entitled to regulate their own academic affairs and administrative processes, including in relation to placement arrangements, and  as there are a wide range of courses with work placement options, students are encouraged to approach their institutions directly if they have any queries in relation to their work placements. </p></reply>

This was an initial meeting and more detailed terms of reference and a programme of work are in development. </p>  <p>  There are potential areas of overlap with the Youth Justice Strategy, which is at an advanced stage</p>  <p>  of preparation, and this will be taken into account in deciding the particular areas of focus for the forum. The Youth Justice Strategy is another action arising from the Programme for Government commitment and I hope to bring the Strategy to Government for approval with a view to publication as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  In line with principles described by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, these actions recognise that policing is not solely the responsibility of the Garda&iacute; and that a holistic approach across Government, with supportive actions taken by the various agencies and stakeholders in this area, is required to adequately address the concerns of residents in our communities that are adversely affected by anti-social behaviour.</p></reply>

section 13 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (Trespass in a manner likely to cause fear);</p><p>- Offences under section 21 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (Control of access to certain events);</p><p>- Offences under section 3 of the Casual Trading Act 1995 (Casual trading without a licence or contrary to the terms of the licence);</p><p>- Offences under Section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977/84 (Simple possession). This will relate to the possession of cannabis and cannabis resin only. </p><p>An Adult Caution for any of these four offences can only be considered in respect of an offence committed on or after the 14 December 2020 and cannot be applied retrospectively.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to work closely with the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to all elements of the Adult Caution Scheme.</p></reply>

I am working with my colleagues and with our partners to ensure we have an appropriate national response that supports victims and holds perpetrators to account. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency under the aegis of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (DSGBV) and is the primary funder of organisations that deliver frontline services.  I am accountable to the House for the expenditures and the services that are within my area of responsibility and am answering the Deputy's Question on that basis.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding for initiatives aimed at combatting domestic abuse and sexual violence and also provides funding to promote and assist the development of support services to victims of crime, which includes victims of domestic and sexual crime. </p>  <p>  I have secured increased funding for 2021 for combatting domestic abuse and sexual violence and increased funding for supporting victims of crime. Funding of some &euro;3 million has been secured for raising awareness of domestic, sexual and gender based violence and &euro;4.104 million to support victims of crime. </p>  <p>  These figures reflect the additional &euro;2.3 million provided in Budget 2021 for implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases. This will help combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence, through the implementation of the O&rsquo;Malley recommendations on Protection for Vulnerable Witnesses in the Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual Offences.</p>  <p>  The government has been in a position to provide an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with significant additional resources in recent years. This has enabled the Commissioner to allocate additional funding to tackling sexual and domestic violence, including the establishment of a  specialised unit for the investigation of sexual violence, human trafficking, child abuse and domestic abuse, in every division.</p></reply>

This substantial increase will allow for the implementation of the model of parole as envisaged under the Parole Board Act. </p>  <p>  Since my appointment as Minister for Justice in June 2020, I have put in place a dedicated project team to coordinate, track and drive forward this work across this Department and the Justice Sector. To date, the team has consulted with a number of key stakeholders and an outline project plan has been finalised. This plan maps out a critical path of the various milestones to be achieved from now through to the commencement of the Act and the establishment of the Board in 2021.</p>  <p>  In terms of next steps, I expect accommodation for the new Board to be secured in Q1 2021, with the appointment of staff and the CEO will take place soon thereafter. Further to that, a draft Legal Aid Scheme with accompanying legal procedures and guidance should be prepared in Q2 2020.  My goal is for the full complement of Board members to be ready and available for appointment by mid-June 2021.</p>  <p>  The final stage of the process will be the drafting and signing of the Commencement Order, which I expect to be ready by July 2021. Once this is signed the Board members will be appointed and the new Statutory based Parole Board established.</p></reply>

This pragmatic approach to deportation orders will continue for as long as is necessary. As evidence of this, a total of 154 deportation orders were enforced in 2019 as compared with only 42 in 2020 and 34 of those 42 occurred in the first three months of 2020.</p><p>A decision was taken some time ago to suspend the issuing of negative international protection decisions during periods when Level 5 restrictions are in place and that position continues at the present time. The same position also applies to the making and service of deportation orders, with the exception of the very limited circumstances I have outlined above. </p><p>The table below gives a breakdown of all deportation orders effected in 2020, including in the context of those persons who had an application for international protection refused. </p><p><b>Deportation orders enforced by month in 2020</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Month </th>       <th>All deportation orders enforced*</th>       <th>Deportation orders enforced in respect of failed international protection applicants</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>January </td>       <td>14 </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>February </td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>March </td>       <td>7 </td>       <td>6 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>April </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July </td>       <td>1 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>August </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>September </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>October </td>       <td>3 </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>November </td>       <td>0 </td>       <td>0 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>December </td>       <td>4 </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Totals </td>       <td>42 </td>       <td>27 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*The figures for all deportation orders enforced (42) includes those deportation orders enforced in respect of failed international protection applicants.

In his interim report, the Judge stated that he would not restrict or limit Shane's family in their submissions to him or the nature and extent of the documentation they wished to furnish to him in his scoping exercise. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that my Department recently received a letter from Judge Haughton updating the Department on his progress. In this correspondence, the Judge requested a further extension of the timeline to 29 January 2021 and set out a clear and detailed rationale for this extension.  I understand from Judge Haughton that he provided a copy of this letter to the O'Farrell family and I also wrote to the family to inform them of the extension.</p>  <p>  While I genuinely regret this further delay, I am also aware that the Judge is doing all that he can to ensure that the concerns which the family have raised with him during the process are followed through to the greatest extent possible and this requires additional time. With regard to any further extensions, the Judge is of course completely independent in his work on this scoping exercise, and I cannot intervene in the process, nor can I place any restrictions on the Judge. My Department is providing all necessary assistance to the Judge to enable him to complete his report, and I look forward to receiving it in the near future.</p></reply>

Neither I nor my Department have any function in this regard. However, to be of assistance, officials from my Department contacted the relevant Coroner&rsquo;s office. It is understood that the death referred to occurred on 30 September 2018 in Tallaght Hospital, and that the Coroner directed that a Post Mortem examination be conducted. The result of the Post Mortem examination was received on 23 November 2018, on foot of which the Coroner decided to hold an inquest.   </p>  <p>  In the Dublin District, the average interval between date of death and the holding of an inquest is 20 months due to volume of work. The holding of this inquest might have been expected to have occurred mid-2020. However, complex inquests requiring clinical witnesses to attend court, as in this case, have been significantly delayed due to COVID-19 related public safety restrictions.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Dublin Coroner&rsquo;s office has been in communication with the bereaved family in relation to this matter, most recently on 15 December 2020.</p></reply>

This high-level taskforce will, inter alia, consider how best to provide for the mental health and addiction challenges of those imprisoned, and primary care support on release. </p>  <p>  In order to progress this matter, I met with my colleague the Minister for Health in September to lay the foundations for advancing work on this commitment without delay because I believe that a properly constituted taskforce with the support of both Departments can drive much needed transformation in this area.</p>  <p>  It is widely acknowledged that every person with mental health difficulties coming in contact with the criminal justice system should have access to comprehensive mental health support. The Deputy may appreciate that delivering on this requires considerable planning for, and implementation of, an appropriate model of care for this vulnerable group. </p>  <p>  This will be a complex body of work with a number of cross-cutting issues that cannot be addressed in isolation. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that collaboration with the Department of Health on the development of Terms of Reference and structure for the establishment of the Task Force is now at an advanced stage. The terms of reference have been agreed in principle between the two Departments. Work is now underway to identify a chair and put in place other administrative details as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  We do recognise the urgent need to design and put in place proper systems to care for the most vulnerable people who come into contact with the criminal justice system as a priority and our objective, at present, is to move this matter forward in the first quarter of 2021. Any future funding considerations will also form part of the ongoing work to progress this matter.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I believe that it is important for me to state that this Government is fully committed to implementing the longer-term changes required to make our penal system safe, effective and responsive to the needs of all prisoners, especially vulnerable persons. While it is unlikely there are quick fix solutions to some of the issues as highlighted by the recent report from the Council of Europe Committee on the Prevent of Torture, we are determined to work intensively together to ensure all people get the care and support they need from our system.   </p></reply>

In recent years, the Department of Justice has put a lot of energy into transforming the way it works, with the objective of becoming a more outward facing, collaborative and more effective organisation. </p><p>This includes the use of public consultations to engage directly with communities and members of the public to listen and better understand their views and perspectives. In 2020, my Department conducted a wide-range of public consultations on a variety of key strategies and initiatives, including:</p><p>- The Department&rsquo;s Strategy Statement;</p><p>- Hate speech;</p><p>- Spent convictions;</p><p>- Part 4 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017;</p><p>- Strategy for the Criminal Justice System; </p><p>- Discount rate in personal injury cases; and</p><p>- Youth Justice Strategy.</p><p>As part of the consultation process, the Department uses a variety of methods, leveraging technology and real-time information, to increase awareness of our consultations and maximise engagement, including:</p><p>- &lsquo;Policy forum&rsquo; events, involving key stakeholder groups from NGOs and civil society, legal practitioners and academics;</p><p>- Online surveys;</p><p>- Online consultations/workshops;</p><p>- Call for written submissions; and</p><p>- Targeted digital engagement across our social media platforms.</p><p>As the Deputy can appreciate, the COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges in relation to the physical aspect of our public consultations. Recognising the importance of public engagement, my Department re-designed its consultation processes to include online workshops, ensuring our public consultations could continue. </p><p>Feedback is central to the consultative process and all contributions are considered as part of the development of new polices and legislation. The results of consultations are posted online, with the exception of submissions that are deemed sensitive or include personal information. As every consultation is different, there is no current checklist used. </p><p>In addition, the Department always welcomes and considers all suggestions and feedback on ways to improve the consultation process.</p></reply>

The women are accommodated in houses rather than cell blocks and there is no categorisation of female prisoners.  The regime in the D&oacute;chas Centre is very much focused on training and rehabilitation. </p>  <p>  However, the requirement to ensure the safety and security of all those who live and work in our prisons is universal and in that regard there were changes made in 2019 to enhance the structure of the prison day in the D&oacute;chas.  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that this has enhanced the regime in the prison and allowed for greater access to vital rehabilitative services. As a result, the women accommodated in the D&oacute;chas now have better access to important services such as mental health services, Psychology Service and Addiction Counsellors. </p>  <p>  The Prison Service is acutely aware of the fact that women prisoners are a vulnerable group within the prison system and is aware that the supports for female offenders and their rehabilitative needs are very different to male offenders.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will wish to be aware that staff working with female offenders are provided with bespoke training and in February 2020 the Prison Service introduced a new tailored programme for staff to address the special needs of women prisoners called &lsquo;Working with Women in Custody&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  To enhance the rehabilitative opportunities for female offenders a new programme in partnership with the Probation Service, called the Outlook Programme which is a step down unit for women offenders, was opened in May 2019.  The project is managed by Focus Ireland and the vision of the programme is to promote the rehabilitation and re-integration of women leaving prison and those who have accommodation needs requiring support in the community. </p>  <p>  Finally, it may interest the Deputy to know that the construction of a new prison facility to provide accommodation for 50 female prisoners in Limerick Prison is scheduled to become operational in Q4 2021. The design of the facility is based on the principle of rehabilitation and normalisation recognising the unique requirements of female offenders.  </p></reply>

The identity of every applicant must be confirmed to the greatest extent possible and a passport is a primary identifier.  </p>  <p>  Under normal circumstances, passports are returned approximately 10 days after their receipt.  However, the current limits on staff attendance in the office due to COVID-19 restrictions have resulted in delays in the return of some passports. </p>  <p>  Applicants are advised not to send in their application during the pandemic if they anticipate that they may have to travel at short notice. However, I fully appreciate that people may have to travel at short notice for emergency reasons.  The citizenship website advises that in these circumstances, applicants should email the citizenship helpdesk with the relevant details. Any request must be accompanied by appropriate scanned supporting material detailing the reasons for travel, such as medical information. Any request of this nature is dealt with promptly.</p>  <p>  In general, the current target is that it should take around 12 months for a standard application for a certificate of naturalisation to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. However, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service of my Department. </p>  <p>  In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is required to process an application and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light, which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.   </p>  <p>  I am conscious that a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during Covid-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented the holding of such ceremonies, which are usually attended by hundreds of people and which have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life. This month, I will re-start the process of granting citizenship, without the need to hold in person ceremonies, and I will outline the details of this shortly.</p></reply>

However section 246 of the Children Act 2001 provides for an offence of frightening, bullying or threatening a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or wellbeing. There are also legislative provisions in place to deal with child welfare particularly regarding the relationship between a child and his/her parents or guardians, providing the framework for a legal response to a wide spectrum of child welfare issues. </p>  <p>  As this is a complex area, I am planning for research to be carried out on parental alienation by my Department this year. </p>  <p>  My Department has also recently established the Family Justice Oversight Group which will agree a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill and set out in the Programme for Government. As part of its work, the oversight group will consider the various recommendations, including the recommendation on parental alienation, contained in the Report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on Reform of the Family Law System.</p>  <p>  The Family Court Bill will be a key element of the development of a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts families at the centre of its activities, provides access to specialist supports and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings. The development of sensible, comprehensive and sensitive family law procedures, particularly for vulnerable families, will be central to the new system. </p></reply>

This announcement followed on from the publication of the results of a widespread consultation process, which included in-depth consultations with various civil society and community groups, academics and experts, a public consultation process and a detailed comparative study of approaches to hate crime in 5 other jurisdictions. </p><p>The purpose of this extensive work was to ensure the Department could identify how Ireland&rsquo;s law in this area could be improved, based on a clear understanding the experiences of those impacted by hate speech and hate crime. </p><p>The report is published on my Department's website and sets out ten conclusions which will be used to inform the new legislation:</p><p>1. The 1989 Act should be replaced with a single piece of legislation to cover both hate speech and hate crime</p><p>2. The list of protected characteristics should be updated to include disability and gender.</p><p>3. The Travelling community should be included in the main definition of ethnicity.</p><p>4. Deliberately or recklessly inciting hatred against a person or group because they are associated with a protected characteristic should be a crime, and distributing or displaying material that incites hatred should be a crime.</p><p>5. Strong safeguards will be needed to protect freedom of expression, so that genuine, reasonable contributions to fields such as literature, art, political discussion, science or academic discussion will not be criminalised.</p><p>6. The threshold for criminal prosecution under the new law should be high, but not impossible.</p><p>7. Companies who have effective measures in place to deal with criminal hate speech, and who are applying those measures properly, should not be prosecuted for content that they could not have known was being shared on their platform.</p><p>8. There is a need for new specific, hate-aggravated versions of existing criminal offences.</p><p>9. Extra measures such as alternative verdicts will be needed to make sure hate offences can be prosecuted effectively.</p><p>10. Not every hate incident is serious enough to be a crime, many incidents can and should be dealt with by other means than criminal prosecution</p><p>The new legislation will provide the necessary means to prosecute perpetrators who deliberately or recklessly incite hatred against others on the basis of a protected characteristic and will ensure that incidences of hate crime in our communities can be managed effectively by law. The new legislation will provide for specific, hate-aggravated versions of existing criminal offences. </p><p>It is my intention to bring the General Scheme of this Bill to Government before Easter, and once it is approved, to refer the Bill to the Oireachtas Justice Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny. </p></reply>

More recently, &lsquo;Operation Denton&rsquo;, or the Barnard Review, was established under Kenova. It is an independent Analytical UK Police Review into matters pursuant to the &lsquo;Barnard Judgment&rsquo; [Northern Ireland Court of Appeal dated 5th of July, 2019].  This analytical review concerns collusion in what has become known as the Glenanne Gang Series.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that the manner in which these police investigations and reviews are pursued is entirely a matter for Operation Kenova.  </p>  <p>  The issue of co-operation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with Operation Kenova and Operation Denton is an operational matter and one in which I do not have a role. I can however inform the Deputies that there are arrangements are in place which support the mutual co-operation, assistance and exchange of information between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Operation Kenova Investigation Team and that engagement is ongoing at this time.  The Historical Investigation Coordination  Unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to support this partnership. </p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputies of my continuing commitment to supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in pursuing this work and in providing assistance to the greatest extent possible.  </p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputies will appreciate that dealing with the legacy of the troubles on this island is a difficult and complex task.  The Stormont House Agreement sets out a series of useful measures in this regard to establish effective ways to address the legacy of the troubles. The Government remains fully committed to the implementation of those measures and working in the interests of victims and their families.</p></reply>

Their exceptional commitment has been particularly clear throughout the pandemic, during which they have been playing a key role in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. </p>  <p>  Due to the restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic, I have provided six extensions of immigration permission to 20 April 2021 to ensure that those requiring an immigration permission to work in the state could continue to do so including those providing frontline services. </p>  <p>  I am conscious that a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during Covid-19. Unfortunately, the pandemic has prevented the holding of such ceremonies, which are usually attended by hundreds of people and which have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life.</p>  <p>I  will this month re-start the process of granting citizenship, without the need to hold in person ceremonies, and I will outline the details of this shortly. It is anticipated that, as the backlog is cleared, frontline workers who are awaiting naturalisation will be among those granted citizenship under the new approach.   </p></reply>

The Agreement includes cooperation on law enforcement and criminal justice. In particular, the EU and the UK have agreed to establish a new framework for law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. This will allow for strong cooperation between national police and judicial authorities, including with respect to mutual legal assistance and extradition. </p>  <p>  Following the implementation of the new TCA, the Minister for Justice put into effect a planned range of measures prepared to ensure the relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom in the Justice and Home Affairs field will remain strong and that co-operation is maintained in the public interest.</p>  <p>  Central to this are elements of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020, which was commenced on 17 December 2020. Parts 16 to 20 of the Act contain provisions to deal with the implications of Brexit in a number of key areas in the justice sector. </p>  <p>  While the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant no longer apply to the United Kingdom, under the EU-UK TCA, the swift surrender of criminals between the EU and the UK under a new arrest warrant system, avoiding lengthy extradition procedures, thanks to streamlined procedures, strict deadlines, robust safeguards, procedural rights and judicial control, will be enabled. </p>  <p>  The Agreement also includes a bridging mechanism, subject to certain conditions, pending the adoption of data protection adequacy decisions, such that for a specified period transmission of personal data from the EU to the UK is not regarded as a transfer to a third country. This bridging solution will mean in practice the continuing exchange from 1 January 2021 of vital law enforcement data between Ireland and the UK. </p>  <p>  The above measures are of particular value in supporting the existing excellent operational cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in respect of the full range of policing activities. </p>  <p>  There are, of course, other international mechanisms that will also continue to be used to support international cooperation, such as INTERPOL in relation to organised crime matters and mutual assistance provisions.</p>  <p>  There is also a range of mechanisms in place to facilitate policing on the island of Ireland. A joint Cross-Border Policing Strategy is operated between the two services. The Joint Agency Task Force is led by senior officers of both police services and other law enforcement agencies, and focuses on tackling organised and cross jurisdictional crime.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy of the shared commitment to combatting crime and security threats on the island of Ireland.  </p></reply>

My Department has consistently adopted a pragmatic approach in this area in the context of Covid-19. </p>  <p>  Transfers under the EU Dublin III Regulation are not deportations.  However, in effecting any such transfers a pragmatic approach is also being adopted in the context of Covid-19. </p>  <p>  The Dublin Regulation determines which Member State is responsible for examining an international protection application. It is based on the principle that the first Member State to facilitate entry into the EU should be responsible for examining the protection application. The objective of the Dublin Regulation is to ensure quick access to asylum procedures and the examination of an application on the merits by a single, clearly determined Member State.  </p>  <p>  Traditionally, a number of the transfer decisions made in this country have been to the UK, which was still bound by the EU Regulation until the end of 2020, under the transitional arrangements of the Withdrawal Agreement.  Dublin Regulation transfers to the UK cannot now take place following the end of the transitional arrangements. </p>  <p>  The person concerned was the subject of a transfer decision to the UK under the Dublin III Regulation. My Department provided an undertaking in this case in December 2020, which effectively meant that the person concerned would not be transferred to the UK before the end of that year.  </p></reply>

The Act also established the Property Services Regulatory Authority (PSRA), a statutory regulatory body specifically tasked with responsibility for licensing and regulating property services providers (auctioneers, estate agents, letting agents and property management agents). </p>  <p>  Under the Property (Services) Regulation Act 2011, any business or individual who provides a property service (other than those who are subject to a similar licence or authentication scheme in another EU Member State) must hold a valid licence from the PSRA. The licensing of property services providers ensures that licensees comply with certain standards aimed at ensuring protection for their clients. For example, licensees must possess specified minimum qualifications, have available to them professional indemnity insurance and pay an annual contribution to the Compensation Fund. </p>  <p>  The PSRA is empowered to investigate complaints of improper conduct made against licensed property services providers, and to launch investigations on its own initiative for the purpose of ensuring compliance by property services providers with their statutory obligations. Where a finding of improper conduct is made by the PSRA, it can impose a range of sanctions: namely, issue a reprimand, warning, caution or advice, suspend or revoke a licence, or direct the licensee to pay a financial penalty (i.e. pay up to &euro;50,000 into the Property Services Compensation Fund, up to &euro;50,000 to the PSRA towards the cost of the investigation, up to &euro;250,000 to the PSRA by way of financial penalty or any combination of the foregoing).</p>  <p>  The Act provides for the establishment of the Property Services Compensation Fund which is funded by annual contributions from licensees, and maintained and administered by the PSRA. A person who has suffered financial loss as a result of dishonesty on the part of a licensee, or any principal officer, employee or agent or former principal officer, employee or agent of a licensee arising from the provision of property services on behalf of the licensee, is entitled to apply to the PSRA for a grant from the Fund to compensate him/her for the loss sustained as a result of the dishonesty.</p>  <p>  Businesses that are licensed to provide property services (property services employers and independent contractors) are also required under the Act to have in place professional indemnity insurance. This insurance must cover both the business, and all principal officers and employees engaged in the provision of property services on the business&rsquo;s behalf. The minimum requirements in respect of professional indemnity insurance are set out in the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 (Professional Indemnity Insurance) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 182 of 2012). </p>  <p>  While my Department keeps the operation of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 under review, there are no plans at present to amend the Act in the way suggested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Of the 43 confirmed prisoner cases 23 were community acquired infections and 20 were prison based.</p>  <p>  To date, none of the cases have required hospital treatment and the Irish Prison Service inform me that there are procedures in place for this eventuality should it become necessary.</p>  <p>  The measures which have been introduced are guided by the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team and consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organisation and guidance of the Council of Europe.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that there is a Primary Healthcare service available at each prison consisting of doctors and nurses who are responsible for the management of healthcare issues including the treatment of Covid-19. To date, all positive Covid-19 cases in the prisoner population have been managed in the relevant prison and there has been no requirement to transfer any prisoner to hospital. If however the prison healthcare service consider that a prisoner requires hospital treatment they would refer the prisoner to the relevant hospital, alerting in advance that they are sending a Covid-19 patient. The prisoner in question would be transferred to the hospital via an ambulance.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service continues to manage the risks and challenges faced in a prison context during the Covid-19 pandemic in line with public health guidelines. In doing so, it maintains a close working relationship with my Department, relevant criminal justice authorities, the National Public Health Emergency Team and the HSE.</p></reply>

The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>This includes people with a disability who are over 65 years old and living in long term residential care facilities and the healthcare workers who care for them.</p><p>It is important to note that people with a disability are not a homogenous group and, therefore, each individual will be vaccinated in the group that is appropriate to them.</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Further information on the Strategy can be found at:</p><p>.</p></reply>

The Government decided to close these administrative schemes in 2013, on foot of the reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both Schemes in the context of the Equal Status Acts. </p>  <p>  In 2013, the Government also decided to continue payment of the monthly Mobility Allowance on an interim basis, to those who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the Scheme closed.  Of the 4,700 individuals in receipt of the Mobility Allowance (&euro;9 million per annum) when the Scheme closed in 2013, there were 3,648 people in receipt of the interim payments at September, 2020. </p>  <p>  At the whole of Government level, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 sets the overall framework for the equal participation of people with disabilities in society.  Monitoring of the implementation of the Strategy is being overseen by the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group which comprises key Government Departments, the National Disability Authority and the Disability Stakeholders Group.  </p>  <p>  Under the Strategy,  the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of accessible public transport and is committed to the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities.   </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals for the provision of transport supports for people with disabilities.  I intend to revert to Government with proposals in due course.  Recent developments which will impact on the policy options include the following:</p>  <p>- The ongoing progress by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in providing accessible public transport nationally and that Department's public consultation, to review active travel and public transport policy, including accessible public transport;</p>  <p>- The Cost of Disability Study currently underway which was commissioned by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as part of Budget 2019.  The research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, including transport costs; and</p>  <p>- The Working Group established under Action 104 of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy by the Department of Justice and Equality which states that:- 'We will lead a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and will develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision. This plan will have regard to making the most efficient use of available transport resources.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  Other transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State include the Free Travel Scheme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection; the Revenue Commissioners Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme; and CL&Aacute;R funding, approved by the then Minister for Rural and Community Development, to voluntary organisations providing transport for people with significant mobility issues.</p></reply>

The revised guidance reflects Government&rsquo;s intention that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to evolving public health guidance.</p><p>Service providers have been asked not to take unilateral action in relation to the provision of services and to ensure that robust communications plan are put in place to ensure that each service user and their families have a clear understanding of services to be provided during this current phase.</p><p>The following guidance is under continuing review and will be guided by Public Health advice:</p><p>1. Residential &amp;amp; PA/home support: Residential and home support/ personal assistant services continue to be prioritised and delivered subject to a revised Risk Assessment, Public Health Guidance and direction.</p><p>2. Respite Services: People with complex medical/clinical needs are to remain at home and will receive home support where possible, subject to risk assessment and prioritisation criteria.</p><p>3. Children&rsquo;s Services: Therapy services for children with disabilities have been identified as &ldquo;Level 1&rdquo; in the HSE business continuity plan.  Services will continue to be provided either remotely or face to face as appropriate during the current COVID-19 restrictions. The provision of Assessments of Need under the Disability Act continues to be a priority and each CHO area will continue to evaluate their plans on an on-going basis.</p><p>4. Adult Day Services: Extra funding has been provided to build capacity in buildings and to provide extra staff. This will ensure that maximum services will continue at a scale so that they can be provided safely to those most in need. Day services continue to be prioritised and delivered subject to a revised Risk Assessment, Public Health Guidance and direction. People with complex medical/ clinical related needs are to remain at home and, where possible to receive the same number of hours support in the home as they had been in receipt of pre-Christmas in day service locations. Providers have been asked to reduce contacts via hubs/bubbles, with dedicated staff for dedicated service users, where possible. Where families are uncomfortable with allowing their family member to return to a day service location, a package of support within available resources will be agreed with the service user and family.</p><p>The full guidance is available on the HSE website at: </p><p> </p></reply>

This allows for follow up and monitoring of any adverse events.  The HSE is planning for the production of Vaccine certificates at part of its implementation planning for a Covid 19 vaccination programme.</p>  <p>  Immunity passports are problematic on a number of grounds. It is not yet clear if the proposed vaccines for Covid 19 actually stop people getting the virus. It is also not clear whether the thresholds for protective immunity are the same in all groups e.g. older persons or those who are immunosuppressed. Thus, it is premature to discuss immunity passports due to the many uncertainties that still exist regarding immunity against the novel corona virus.  The WHO has cautioned Governments against introducing immunity passports at this time and has advised that the focus should be on vaccine certificates. </p></reply>

It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.</p><p>As I'm sure the Deputies can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.  In certain settings, such as weddings, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity, requiring them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading the virus to others.  Under the current public health measures in place for Covid-19 live music is not permitted at weddings.  It is not possible to say what public health measures will be in place in the future.  The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET),  by my Department and by the Government . The measures in place and the public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Details of the public health measures currently in place for weddings can be found at:- </p><p>You may also wish to note that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has provided guidelines for the hospitality industry which includes guidance on weddings and is available at: - </p></reply>

The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.</p>  <p>  The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.</p></reply>

Since the start of August 2020, there has been a total of 21 outbreaks, with 158 associated cases. Two residents have been hospitalised, with no resident admitted to ICU and no recorded death. </p>  <p>  The HPSC is carrying out ongoing validation with the data and information.  I have therefore, for the purpose of accuracy, referred this request for information to the HPSC for attention and direct reply to the Deputies.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE work closely with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration &amp;amp; Youth to ensure that the health and welfare of international protection applicants living in direct provision are protected. The HSE has provided specific COVID-19 guidance for Direct Provision settings.  A range of measures are in place in direct provision centres to address any cases of COVID-19 if and when they arise.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a major impact in Ireland and globally. It is imperative that residents in direct provision centres adhere strictly to public health advice at Level 5. By following the public health advice, we can reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities and support the provision of vital non-COVID healthcare services. </p></reply>

To support people with a disability, significant resources have been invested by the health sector in disability services, and the Government has ensured that an additional &euro;100 million is being provided for new disability measures next year under Budget 2021. These measures will include an additional 80,000 personal assistant hours.  The 2020 national service plan details that the HSE is seeking to deliver 1.67m hours of Personal Assistant Hours to over 2,550 people.</p>  <p>  In preparing for and responding to COVID-19 and to fully align with Public Health guidance as recommended via the NPHET, the HSE and its partner service providers put in place a range of measures, which included the prioritisation of vital Residential and Home Support/PA services. </p>  <p>  The Government is working to ensure that People with Disabilities be allowed to live an independent life of their own choosing, the same as any other person, and this is consistent with the disability reform policy - &ldquo;transforming lives&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The HSE provides a range of assisted living services including Personal Assistant (PA) services to support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives.</p>  <p>  Personal Assistance Services are accessed through an application process or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff. Individual&rsquo;s needs are evaluated against the criteria for prioritisation for the particular services and then decisions are made in relation to the allocation of resources.</p>  <p>  Resource allocation is determined by the needs of the individual, compliance with prioritisation criteria, and the level of resources available. It is important to note that the level of service delivered is varied to ensure that each client&rsquo;s needs are reflected. Therefore there is no average agreed number of PA hours per person. PA and Home Support Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers. The majority of specialised disability provision (80%) is delivered through non-statutory sector service providers.</p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The highest priority groups, those over the age of 65 living in long-term care facilities and frontline healthcare workers in direct patient contact, will receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The aim of the COVID-19 vaccination programme is to ensure, over time, that vaccine will become available to vaccinate all of those for whom the vaccine is indicated. Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.  This is wholly dependent on supply lines and on candidate vaccines obtaining approval.  Therefore, it is not possible at this time to determine a timeframe for the full vaccination programme.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Further information on the Allocation Strategy can be found at:</p><p>.</p></reply>

It monitors the health and wellbeing of people living in Ireland. The survey was stopped at the commencement of Covid-19 restrictions as the survey method (face-to-face) was not compatible with Covid-19 restrictions.  The survey fieldwork has restarted, using a new phone questionnaire with an emphasis on living with Covid-19. It includes a module on mental health and suicide. The results will be available next year. </p><p>The Department has partnered with Am&aacute;rach Research for a series of monthly surveys in relation to the effects of covid-19 upon the population. The November Research Study showed that, while people&rsquo;s happiness is still low and boredom has increased, stress, worry, anxiety and frustration have reduced since March (first survey). </p><p>Am&aacute;rach opinion surveys can be found at:  </p><p> </p><p>The CSO has published four rounds of their Social Impacts of Covid-19 in Ireland survey. The survey results provide data on people&rsquo;s lifestyle and wellbeing at various stages of the pandemic and restrictions levels.  </p><p>Results of the surveys can be found on the CSO website: </p><p><i>/</i></p><p> </p><p>There have been a number of studies and research conducted by other organisations, including the National Suicide Research Foundation, Mental Health Reform and an International Covid-19 Psychological Research Consortium. The studies examined the impact of Covid-19 on people&rsquo;s mental health and well-being. Results of these studies can be accessed by contacting the relevant organisation. </p><p>I recognise that the Covid pandemic may increase anxiety levels among the general population. The Government campaigns, &ldquo;In this Together&rdquo; and &ldquo;Keep Well&rdquo;, which encourage and offer practical advice on keeping our physical and mental health well, provide support for dealing with this issue. </p><p>We do not yet fully understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health, the extent of subsequent supports that may be required or how this may affect longer term demand for services. However, the HSE already has a range of proactive responses for any rise in service need, including online and other telehealth psychosocial supports. </p><p>&euro;2.2 million was provided to the HSE in 2020 for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports to improve population health outcomes. Telehealth services were rapidly enhanced during the first wave and are now fully established to provide a broader service to clients. 7-day telehealth services include YourMentalHealth.ie, the information line 1800 111 888, the crisis textline and NGO partners&rsquo; online supports such as MYMind. Use of these services has increased significantly during Covid-19.</p><p>The Department and HSE continue to plan for any surge in demand as it arises and as services return to normal provision and capacity, subject to public health advice. </p><p>I am referring this PQ to the HSE for part response to inform on research being conducted at a service level. </p></reply>

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it has received pricing and reimbursement applications for two indications of Dupilumab (Dupixent):</p>  <p>  - For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  - For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for pricing / reimbursement of Dupilumab in November 2017 from the manufacturer for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.  The HSE commissioned a full HTA on 29 November 2017 as per agreed processes.  This assessment was completed on 12 December 2019 with the NCPE recommending that Dupilumab be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, the HSE received an application for the pricing / reimbursement of Dupilumab on 13 December 2019 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned the rapid review process on the 17 December 2019. Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on the 17 January 2020 that a HTA was not recommended and that Dupilumab not be considered for reimbursement for this indication at the submitted price.</p>  <p>  The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the company in February 2020 regarding both the adult and adolescent populations.</p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members and clinicians.</p>  <p>  The final HTA report concerning Dupilumab was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial negotiations, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE Drugs Group considered all the evidence and gave a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) not to support reimbursement of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that the applicant company was issued with notice of the proposed decision of the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement on 21 August 2020.  On 18 September 2020, the applicant company submitted representations with respect to this application.</p>  <p>  The HSE reviewed these representations, as is required in such circumstances under the 2013 Health Act, and engaged in a meeting in November 2020 with the applicant company to discuss the submission.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that a Drugs Group meeting did take place in December 2020, at which point it was not possible to discuss Dupilumab due to time constraints. </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that a HSE Drugs Group&rsquo;s meeting has been scheduled for the afternoon of 12th January 2020, subject to the confirmed quorum being achieved. The HSE has indicated that there is a risk that it will not be possible to achieve the necessary quorum, as contributing clinicians are under significant pressures with competing priorities due to the pandemic. In the event that the quorum is not maintained, this meeting will need to be rescheduled.</p>  <p>  The HSE EMT will, on receipt of the outcome of the Drugs Group's deliberations, make the decision on whether Dupilumab will be reimbursed.</p></reply>

The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it received an application in December 2018 for the reimbursement of Patisiran (Onpattro) for the treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) in adult patients with stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy.</p>  <p>  In January 2019, a full HTA with respect to this indication was commissioned by the HSE. This assessment was completed in February 2020, with the NCPE recommending that Patisiran not be considered for reimbursement unless cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  The HTA report with respect to Patisiran was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial discussions with the applicant which took place in May 2020, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process.</p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members and clinicians.</p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group requested patient and clinician input via the Rare Diseases Technology Review Committee (RDTRC) to assist the group in making its recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) regarding reimbursement of Patisiran.</p>  <p>  In September 2020, The RDTRC convened and reviewed the clinical data previously submitted as part of the established pricing and reimbursement process. The Committee also heard from Consultants involved in the specialist management of patients with hATTR amyloidosis.</p>  <p>  The RDTRC continued its review of Patisiran at its subsequent meeting on 5 November 2020 which included patient input on the impact of hATTR amyloidosis.</p>  <p>  Following these meetings, the Committee finalised a statement summarising the clinician and patient engagement on Patisiran which was forwarded to the HSE Drugs Group for consideration.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that additional information has been submitted by the manufacturer following engagements in December 2020 and January 2021. This information will be considered by the HSE Drugs Group along with the statement from the RDTRC.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that a HSE Drugs Group&rsquo;s meeting has been scheduled for the afternoon of 12th January 2020, subject to the confirmed quorum being achieved.  The HSE has indicated that there is a risk that it will not be possible to achieve the necessary quorum, as contributing clinicians are under significant pressures with competing priorities due to the pandemic. In the event that the quorum is not maintained, this meeting will need to be rescheduled.</p>  <p>  The application for Patisiran remains under consideration in line with the 2013 Health Act. The HSE Executive Management Team is the decision-making body for the reimbursement of medicines and it will make the decision on whether Patisiran will be reimbursed in line with the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

From June onwards, CHI at Crumlin had recommenced the majority of outpatient and diagnostic services, albeit at reduced numbers, due to public health guidelines on social distancing. However, due to the recent rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the community and the need to reduce the number of people coming into the children&rsquo;s hospitals, CHI will be prioritising emergency, urgent and time sensitive procedures and care. In so far as possible, most out-patient clinics will be moved to virtual or telephone clinics, unless specified by the consultant that a face to face review is needed.  </p>  <p>  CHI has further advised my Department that there is an active recruitment campaign for an additional Rheumatology Consultant underway. This additional position will allow for an increased number of patients to be seen, diagnosed and treatment initiated, as part of the comprehensive Rheumatology service.</p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of MRI services, the demand for specialist imaging has increased over recent years due to increased activity and acuity in CHI, as well as an increasing trend to utilise imaging in diagnosis and treatment.  CHI have advised that, uniquely to Paediatrics, younger children and children up to 18 years old with complex needs may be unable to remain still in an MRI for the lengthy periods required to complete the scan, resulting in the requirement for a General Anaesthetic (GA) to be delivered by a Paediatric Anaesthesiologist.  This limits the ability for these scans to be performed outside of CHI hospitals. CHI have confirmed to my Department that each request for an MRI scan is carefully examined by Consultant Radiologists who must prioritise, based on clinical urgency, each case in terms of access to the scanner.  </p>  <p>  CHI has advised that patients with Down Syndrome who present to Rheumatology services with suspicion of arthritis are clinically assessed and diagnosed by the clinical team. A cohort of these patients will require an MRI scan based on the individualised clinical examination and recommendation.  </p></reply>

It encompasses many other projects and pillars of eHealth, Sl&aacute;intecare and ICT working together to form a joined up modern health system that delivers patient data in a consistent, convenient and robust format for use by clinical staff providing care to patients. </p>  <p>  Some major building blocks are already in place. There has been a consistent level of capital investment in core ICT infrastructure and clinical systems since the publication of the eHealth strategy in 2013. An enterprise wide EHR systems was deployed in the largest acute hospitals in Ireland (St James Hospital, Dublin) in 2018. The procurement of an even more extensive EHR for the national children&rsquo;s hospital is currently underway. Standards are being developed to support interoperability between health systems. The provision of more care in the community and reducing our reliance on services delivered in the acute hospital sector, will require the delivery of healthcare records for patients that can be accessed across the health sector, allowing 'data to follow the patient'. This is one of the ambitions of the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme and will lead to greater levels of integrated care and the ability to treat more patients nearer to home.</p>  <p>  There are relatively few countries that have achieved a level of integrated health care records at national level. Those that have only done only achieved this goal after many years of consistent investment focussed on that ambition. Ireland is on that journey.</p></reply>

In this regard, my Department is in the process of developing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support.</p>  <p>  Work is on-going within the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the new scheme within the broader context of the on-going reform of Ireland&rsquo;s health and social care system, as envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report (2017). This work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme; the examination of the options for the financing model for the scheme; and the development of a reformed model of service-delivery.</p>  <p>  The aim of the development of a regulatory framework for home-support services is to ensure that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care, which is safe, effective, and person-centred. It is intended that, subject to Government approval, this framework will comprise primary legislation, minimum standards, and national standards. Work is ongoing within the Department to determine the definition of home-support which will underpin the legislation. This will be informed by stakeholder consultation.  </p>  <p>  The options for the financing of the new scheme are being examined through work with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) on the projected demand for, and cost of, home-support services in various scenarios.

They help individuals to build their recovery capital and to avoid relapse into harmful patterns of substance use.  </p><p>The Department of Health has published guidance for drug and alcohol support groups and treatment programmes and other addiction treatment services, including at Level 5. The guidance is available at www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/17d32f-drugs-and-alcohol-policy.</p><p>The guidance applies to drug and alcohol support groups for people and families who live with drug and alcohol addiction (including gambling addiction), e.g. self-help/fellowship groups, peer support, family/parent support.</p><p>It is important that individuals should adhere to the public health advice and restrictions at Level 5, including staying at home and restricting movements to within 5km of home, except for their attendance at support groups and treatment programmes and other specified exceptions.</p><p>The main points contained in the updated Guidelines relating to attending/facilitating support groups and programmes include:</p><p>- It is recommended to hold meetings and deliver programmes online or outdoors where this is possible, without diluting the benefits for participants.</p><p>- Where it is decided to host a face-to-face group/programme meeting, organisers are advised to undertake a risk assessment to ensure the health, welfare and safety of participants.</p><p>- Facilities used to host support groups and treatment programmes should be for exclusive use, where possible, and not shared with other users.</p><p>- The recommended maximum number of attendees at levels 3, 4 and 5 is 15 people (including leaders), with 2 metres social distancing. Face coverings should be used.</p><p>- Support groups and programmes should last a maximum of 105 minutes.</p><p>- Individuals at higher risk from Covid-19, or in close contact with such individuals,should only attend meetings that are conducted online.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a major impact in Ireland and globally. It is imperative that drug and alcohol support groups adhere strictly to public health advice at Level 5. By following the public health advice, we can reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities and support the provision of vital non-COVID healthcare services.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.</p>  <p>  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable.</p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.</p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Further information on the Strategy can be found at:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

On 18 September 2020, the NCPE completed its assessment and recommended that Voretigene neparvovec not be considered for reimbursement unless cost effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  The final HTA report will be reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial negotiations which took place in November 2020 and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE advises that Voretigene neparvovec is expected to be included on a Drugs Group agenda in early 2021.</p>  <p>  The HSE Executive Management Team is the decision-making body for the reimbursement of medicines under the Health Act 2013 and it will, following receipt of the outcome of the Drugs Group's deliberations, make the decision on whether Voretigene neparvovec will be reimbursed.</p></reply>

It is noted that every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to provide an eligibility assessment process that is responsive and sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services and to that end, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card where an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold.</p></reply>

The extent of the involvement of Health Service Executive (HSE)  personnel in the Scheme relates to making a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant meets the specified medical criteria for a Primary Medical Certificate. This determination is undertaken by Senior Medical Officers for the relevant HSE Community Health Organisation on behalf of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that following a Supreme Court decision of  June 2020, the assessment process for Primary Medical Certificates was suspended at the request of the Minister for Finance. In order to allow for the Primary Medical Certificate assessments to recommence, the Minister for Finance brought forward amendments to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation. </p>  <p>  Following a request from Minister Donohoe, my colleague the Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly T.D. issued an instruction to the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Service Executive on 22nd December, 2020, to the effect that Primary Medical Certificate assessments can recommence with effect from 1st January, 2021.</p></reply>

The Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration has requested an update on the recommendations of the Report on Tackling Childhood Obesity, and it is expected that a comprehensive update will issue shortly. </p>  <p>  Obesity, and in particular childhood obesity, is a priority area for the Government, as reflected in the Programme for Government, "Our Shared Future".  It is also a high priority of mine in my capacity as Minister for Public Health, Wellbeing and the National Drugs Strategy.  Funding has been provided in Budget 2021 with a particular focus on developing healthy communities by addressing health and well-being in areas of deprivation and details are currently being progressed with a range of stakeholders. This approach will take into a range of factors that impact health and well-being as part  of a whole- systems approach, and child obesity will be an important element of this.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p>  <p>  The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p>  <p>  All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally. </p>  <p>  Over time there will be enough vaccine available to vaccinate all those who want it. We are planning to vaccinate as many people within our population, with approved vaccines, as quickly, safely, and effectively as possible. </p>  <p>  Training is now available to all relevant staff and being completed on a daily rolling basis to build up the number of vaccinators.  Over 2,000 people have now completed the training programme. Pharmacists, GPs, doctors, nurses, paramedics, and many healthcare professionals, will have a role to play in the vaccination programme.</p></reply>

This was utilised specifically in respect of the development of the first four Regional Fertility Hubs &ndash; namely, at Cork Maternity University Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital. </p>  <p>  While three of the first four regional hubs are based in Dublin, their total catchment area relates to that of the four corresponding regional health areas of the country. </p>  <p>  Additional funding of just over &euro;1m is being made available to enable the continuation and completion of Phase One of the roll-out in 2021, including through the setting-up of the final two Regional Fertility Hubs, to be located in Galway and Limerick.    </p>  <p>  The roll-out of Phase One has been slowed due to the management of the Covid-19 pandemic by the health service broadly and its impact upon the provision of elective health services, including fertility services.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country and the AHR legislation commenced. While it is not possible at this juncture to give a definitive timeline for the completion of the roll-out, the introduction of a publicly-funded model of care for fertility treatment is a Programme for Government commitment. It is intended that, in line with available resources, this will be fully implemented on a phased basis over the course of the coming years.</p>  <p>  Overall, the implementation of the model of care will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I am aware that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access AHR treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.</p></reply>

In order to mitigate the impact of the loss of access to care in the UK under the EU CBD scheme for persons resident in Ireland, the Government has agreed to provide for the implementation of a replacement scheme to be available in Northern Ireland only from 1 January 2021. The new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme will operate for 12 months and will operate on the same parameters as the EU Cross Border Directive scheme.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE has also put in place transitional arrangements for certain patients who have a legitimate expectation of continuing to access care in the UK under the current provisions of the EU Cross-Border Directive Scheme including provision for reimbursement of healthcare costs by the HSE to persons who fall into certain categories, such as patients who can evidence that they have treatment booked prior to December 2020 for treatment in 2021.  Patients are advised to contact the HSE CBD office directly with queries on individual applications and whether they are covered by the transitional arrangements or the new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is also important to note that, patients continue to have access to health services under the EU CBD Scheme in all other remaining EU countries.</p></reply>

Over 50 per cent of those tenancies have already been delivered; and the success rate of the programme through housing sustainment is over 85 per cent, which compares very favourably with the best outcomes achieved by Housing First internationally. </p>  <p>  A Housing First Manual for Ireland was published in December 2020 and will assist housing and healthcare practitioners in implementing the model in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health provides annual funding of &euro;36 million to the HSE for the health services and supports for homeless people, which is an increase of &euro;6 million since 2016. From this allocation, the HSE provides funding for health supports for those availing of tenancies through Housing First. </p>  <p>  I along with my colleagues the Minister for Health and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage are committed to reducing and preventing homelessness.  Housing First is an important policy instrument to reach this goal. In  Budget 2021, I secured &euro;1m for health supports for 218 new tenancies under the Housing First programme. as part of an overall allocation of &euro;3.8m for the addiction and health needs of people who are homeless.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the spend on the health element of Housing First for 2018 - 2020, and is therefore a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Patients in receipt of non-Covid-19 related care were, subject to exemptions (e.g. a medical card holder), liable for the &euro;80 statutory public in-patient charge while patients in receipt of Covid-19 related care were exempt from charges. Provision was made under the agreement to allow for continuity of care for patients who were in a private hospital or attending for treatment at the time the Heads of Terms of Agreement were agreed, on the grounds that these patients would be treated as public patients.</p>  <p>  Private patients who received non-covid-19 related care in public hospitals for the duration of the Framework Agreement continued to be subject to the private in-patient charges provided for in Section 55 of the Health Act 1970 (as amended) in addition to any professional fees for consultant services which are the subject of negotiation between health insurers and consultants.</p>  <p>  Patients who were admitted to private hospitals prior to the commencement of the Framework Agreement and were receiving care in private hospitals during this time should only have been doing so to continue a course of treatment that had commenced before the start of the agreement between the private hospitals and the HSE, as per the terms of the agreement. They should therefore have been treated on a public basis, and not privately. The statutory daily public in-patient charge of &euro;80 therefore should, subject to exemptions, apply, and the patient should not be liable for private professional or hospital fees, or the excesses that they pay as part of their health insurance contract on those fees.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to provide further information regarding the specific details of this case, to facilitate further clarification with the HSE.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally. </p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Ireland is implementing the EU &lsquo;traffic lights&rsquo; approach to travel, which applies to countries in the EU/ EEA. </p><p>Advice for travel during the COVID-19 pandemic can be found at the below link.</p><p> </p><p>Further information on the Allocation Strategy can be found at:</p><p>.</p></reply>

The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the plan is based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.</p><p>At level 5, all non-essential retail, and all non-essential services must remain closed.

There are seventeen professions designated under the 2005 Act, which are encompassed in the list of essential services.  These are: Dietitians, Dispensing Opticians, Medical Scientists, Occupational Therapists, Optometrists, Physiotherapists (which includes Physical Therapists), Radiographers, Radiation Therapists, Social Workers, Speech and Language Therapists, Clinical Biochemists, Counsellors, Orthoptists, Podiatrists, Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Social Care Workers.</p></reply>

The new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme will operate for 12 months and will operate on the same parameters as the EU Cross Border Directive scheme.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE has also put in place transitional arrangements for certain patients who have a legitimate expectation of continuing to access care in the UK under the current provisions of the EU Cross-Border Directive Scheme including provision for reimbursement of healthcare costs by the HSE to persons who fall into certain categories, such as patients who can evidence that they have treatment booked prior to December 2020 for treatment in 2021.  Patients are advised to contact the HSE CBD office directly with queries on individual applications and whether they are covered by the transitional arrangements or the new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is also important to note that, patients continue to have access to health services under the EU CBD Scheme in all other remaining EU countries.</p></reply>

The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, in its current form, does not place caps on the financial assessment of family farms or family businesses when calculating the means to pay for nursing home care, except in the case of sudden illness or disability.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. This change has been approved by Government and undergone pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood.</p>  <p>  Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I have exchanged letters with the Business Committee requesting a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></reply>

The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, in its current form, does not place caps on the financial assessment of family farms or family businesses when calculating the means to pay for nursing home care, except in the case of sudden illness or disability.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. This change has been approved by Government and undergone pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood.</p>  <p>  Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I have exchanged letters with the Business Committee requesting a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></reply>

At present all children under six years of age are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under. The initial stage of this phased expansion will be the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged between 6 and 8.</p>  <p>  The appropriate date for commencing the expansion remains under consideration in light of COVID-19 and the additional pressures the expansion might place on general practice in that context and in anticipation of the usual increase in demand for healthcare services over the winter period. This date will be determined following consultation with the IMO. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, in its current form, does not place caps on the financial assessment of family farms or family businesses when calculating the means to pay for nursing home care, except in the case of sudden illness or disability.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. This change has been approved by Government and undergone pre-legislative scrutiny in the last D&aacute;il. The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood.</p>  <p>  Progress on the development of the Bill was negatively impacted by the dissolution of the last D&aacute;il and by the COVID-19 pandemic. The response to the pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority. However, work on this legislation has continued to progress. I have exchanged letters with the Business Committee requesting a waiver to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny, given this was already undertaken in the previous D&aacute;il. I have met with the Attorney General to discuss this legislation, and there has been an ongoing and active engagement between the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on the development of the legislation, which will be brought to the Houses of Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></reply>

Once the products are listed in Schedule 1 of these Regulations the suppliers will be permitted to supply these products to the Irish market, in line with legal and regulatory requirements.

The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally. </p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Further information on the Strategy can be found at: <i>.</i></p></reply>

The 3-month period commenced on 18 May 2020.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that across the health and social care disciplines, there could be over 8,000 students on placement in hospital and healthcare settings.  Of this number, around a third are final year students.  The length of placements and the activities performed during these placements vary between the disciplines. These students are not employees and in many cases the nature of the placement can, in the main, be limited to participation in an observing and a learning capacity.</p>  <p>  Uniquely for student nurses and midwives there is, in the final year, a paid salary when they are specifically employed on an internship placement. Student nurses and midwives&rsquo; final year internship placement consists of a continual 36-week rostered clinical placement, including annual leave. The internship placement is a paid placement as the student nurses and midwives take a reduced caseload. During these placements, students are under supervision and are considered as 0.5 WTE of the workforce. In addition, Intern students can be allocated across all shift patterns including nights, weekends and 12-hour days.</p>  <p>  Student nurses and midwives undertaking unpaid supernumerary clinical placement as students are currently in receipt of an allowance. Again, given the unique requirements of these training programmes attendance at many placement sites is required, some of which are at a distance to base training hospital and the current allowance is to contribute to the cost of alternative accommodation/travel.</p></reply>

COVID-19 is still having a major impact both here in Ireland and elsewhere. </p><p>On Tuesday 15 September the Government published &lsquo;Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19&rsquo;. This Plan outlines our medium-term strategy for COVID-19 and sets out a Framework of 5 Levels which outline the broad measures which will apply depending on the level of the virus at any given time. It will be possible for different regions and counties to be at different levels, depending on prevailing epidemiological situation. The Plan is designed to help everyone &ndash; individuals, organisations and sectors &ndash; to better understand, anticipate and prepare for the measures that might be introduced to contain transmission of the virus. The intention is that Departments and sectors will provide guidance for specific sectors and activities in line with the 5 level framework. </p><p>At Level 5 of the Plan, only essential retail outlets and essential services are allowed to open to the public. The list of essential services that can remain open during Level 5 includes therapy services provided by a member of a designated profession within the meaning of section 3 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (No. 27 of 2005).  There are seventeen professions designated under the 2005 Act, which are encompassed in the list of essential services. These are: Dietitians, Dispensing Opticians, Medical Scientists, Occupational Therapists, Optometrists, Physiotherapists (which includes Physical Therapists), Radiographers, Radiation Therapists, Social Workers, Speech and Language Therapists, Clinical Biochemists, Counsellors, Orthoptists, Podiatrists, Psychologists, Psychotherapists and Social Care Workers.</p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position. The latest public health advice on these matters is available at the links below and is updated on a regular basis:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p></reply>

In order to mitigate the impact of the loss of access to care in the UK under the EU CBD scheme for persons resident in Ireland, the Government has agreed to provide for the implementation of a replacement scheme to be available in Northern Ireland only from 1 January 2021. The new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme will operate for 12 months and will operate on the same parameters as the EU Cross Border Directive scheme.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE has also put in place transitional arrangements for certain patients who have a legitimate expectation of continuing to access care in the UK under the current provisions of the EU Cross-Border Directive Scheme including provision for reimbursement of healthcare costs by the HSE to persons who fall into certain categories, such as patients who can evidence that they have treatment booked prior to December 2020 for treatment in 2021.  Patients are advised to contact the HSE CBD office directly with queries on individual applications and whether they are covered by the transitional arrangements or the new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is also important to note that, patients continue to have access to health services under the EU CBD Scheme in all other remaining EU countries.</p></reply>

The HSE have indicated that they expect to conclude these agreements very shortly. Discussions are still underway with one remaining hospital. Under the agreement, the hospitals have agreed to supply, depending on the incidence of the disease, up to 15% or 30% of their capacity.</p>  <p>  The agreement also provides for additional capacity over the 30% to be made available by mutual agreement and a number of hospitals have already indicated that they might be willing to offer such capacity if required.  The immediate task is to make effective use of the capacity secured, which will take a number of weeks and any additional requirement will be considered as required.</p>  <p>  The agreement builds on the good relationship which already exists between public and private hospitals and engagement on the transfer of patients is taking place. A number of the private hospitals have already begun to make arrangements to take on public patients over the coming days. The agreement also enables a local relationship between private hospitals and public hospitals in each area, which should result in a more streamlined service for both hospitals and patients.</p>  <p>  The agreement will see the private hospitals provide a full service within the capacity made available including medical services and they will be reimbursed at the standard commercial rate. It allows for the ongoing treatment of private patients and the operation of the traditional private healthcare market alongside the provisions of this arrangement, insofar as is commensurate with the requirements of the overall national pandemic response.</p></reply>

Given that there will be initially limited vaccines available, it will take some time for all to receive those vaccines and that has necessitated an allocation strategy to ensure that those most at risk of death and serious illness receive the vaccine first.</p><p>The priority is to first vaccinate and protect directly the most vulnerable amongst us, that is, those most likely to have a poor outcome if they contract the virus. The priority is to directly use vaccines to save lives and reduce serious illness, hence the focus on the over 65 year old cohort in long term residential care facilities, and healthcare workers in frontline services often caring for the most vulnerable. </p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally. </p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.</p><p>Further information on the Strategy can be found at:</p><p><i>.</i></p></reply>

This document is available from Acute Operations and has been circulated to all Hospital Groups.</p><p>- Data contains urgent, routine and surveillance/planned activity which is currently not broken down in detail, as such this includes surveillance/planned activity which may not be exceeding planned date.</p><p>- Data is still undergoing validation at Hospital and Hospital Group level.</p><p>- Data does not take into account local nuances at site level (Site profile developed to support understanding of same).</p><p>- The purpose of this aggregate data is to provide a National Level overview of the number of patients waiting for modalities of CT, MRI and Ultrasound.</p><p>- This report is not intended to be used for the active management of hospital diagnostics waiting list, local reports and mechanisms should continue to be used for the management of diagnostics waiting lists at hospital level.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy concerning funding for an additional MRI scanner for University Hospital, Limerick, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p><p>">Wait times for MRI scans at University Hospital Limerick</p></reply>

In order to mitigate the impact of the loss of access to care in the UK under the EU CBD scheme for persons resident in Ireland, the Government has agreed to provide for the implementation of a replacement scheme to be available in Northern Ireland only from 1 January 2021. The new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme will operate for 12 months and will operate on the same parameters as the EU Cross Border Directive scheme.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE has also put in place transitional arrangements for certain patients who have a legitimate expectation of continuing to access care in the UK under the current provisions of the EU Cross-Border Directive Scheme including provision for reimbursement of healthcare costs by the HSE to persons who fall into certain categories, such as patients who can evidence that they have treatment booked prior to December 2020 for treatment in 2021.  Patients are advised to contact the HSE CBD office directly with queries on individual applications and whether they are covered by the transitional arrangements or the new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is also important to note that, patients continue to have access to health services under the EU CBD Scheme in all other remaining EU countries.</p></reply>

In relation to the additional &euro;50 million, &euro;23 million has been allocated to commence implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision in 2021. This will fund additional beds and the enhancement of mental health teams, including: Child and Adolescent Mental Health services and Adult Crisis Resolution Teams; expansion of specialist Clinical and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy Programmes; Peer Support and Bereavement Coordinators; and the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) employment approach. This funding will provide for an additional 153 posts in mental health in 2021.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above, &euro;15 million will assist with evolving challenges arising from Covid-19. In this context, the number of step-down beds will be increased and extra resources will be provided for community mental health teams. Reconfiguration of mental health facilities, in line with Mental Health Commission recommendations and the enhancement of digital mental health supports will also take place.</p>  <p>  &euro;2.2 million was provided to the HSE in 2020 for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports to improve population health outcomes.</p></reply>

In order to mitigate the impact of the loss of access to care in the UK under the EU CBD scheme for persons resident in Ireland, the Government has agreed to provide for the implementation of a replacement scheme to be available in Northern Ireland only from 1 January 2021. The new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme will operate for 12 months and will operate on the same parameters as the EU Cross Border Directive scheme.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE has also put in place transitional arrangements for certain patients who have a legitimate expectation of continuing to access care in the UK under the current provisions of the EU Cross-Border Directive Scheme including provision for reimbursement of healthcare costs by the HSE to persons who fall into certain categories, such as patients who can evidence that they have treatment booked prior to December 2020 for treatment in 2021.  Patients are advised to contact the HSE CBD office directly with queries on individual applications and whether they are covered by the transitional arrangements or the new Northern Ireland Planned Healthcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is also important to note that, patients continue to have access to health services under the EU CBD Scheme in all other remaining EU countries.</p></reply>

In this respect the working group will address the key issues raised in the report itself, including future use of peat by the horticulture sector. The position of Chair for the Independent Working Group was advertised and the closing date for receipt of the applications was the 23rd of November 2020. Once the Chair is in place membership of the working group can be established.</p>  <p>  In addition to these developments, my Department is actively looking at alternatives to peat and has funded two research projects to date.

Ireland has supported this element of these proposals. Convergence aims to redistribute and flatten the value of CAP payment entitlements and like all elements of the CAP, there are differing views regarding its implementation.</p>  <p>  Under the current CAP, some &euro;93million was redistributed from farmers with payment entitlements values above the national average to raise the value of payment entitlement held by farmers that were below the national average. This was implemented in a planned, phased manner over the five years of the Basic Payment Scheme and the steps of the convergence were notified to each farmer. This period of planned convergence ended in 2019 following its successful implementation.</p>  <p>  The regulations regarding the transition period enable member states to continue convergence during the transition period, if they so wish. In order to provide for stability, some certainty for farmers and consultation on CAP measures, Ireland chose to rest convergence during the years 2020 and 2021.</p>  <p>  I am reflecting on the approach that should be adopted and I will continue engagement with the relevant stakeholder organisations. I am mindful that any decision on convergence during the transition period is interlinked with plans for convergence in the new CAP. The regulations for the new CAP period have not yet been finalised.</p></reply>

Recent research by Teagasc  estimated that in a no-deal scenario, the average family farm income in 2021 would have decreased by 18%, with average income on beef farms dropping by 40%.</p>  <p>  In concluding a Free Trade Agreement with the UK, this worst case scenario has been avoided. However, it has always been clear that there is no good Brexit for the agrifood sector. While the avoidance of tariffs is hugely significant, the trading relationship has changed and non-tariff barriers will inevitably create costs to trade. These mainly relate to the costs of customs procedures, compliance with SPS requirements, costs of transit and certification requirements. The precise magnitude of these costs is unclear but academic research indicates that they could be in the region of 8-13% of the value of exports. These costs are likely to be higher in the short term but would be expected to ameliorate over the medium to longer term  as firms learn and adapt to the new requirements.</p>  <p>  The impact on farm incomes will depend on how non-tariff barriers translate into additional costs of doing business with the UK, over the next year in particular, and how those costs are absorbed along the value chain. It is not possible to accurately predict the effects on annual farm incomes. However, my Department is closely monitoring the situation in relation to farm incomes.</p>  <p>  I, along with the rest of Government, stands ready to provide the necessary supports for impacted sectors, including through funding from the EU's Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</p></reply>

It is my immediate priority to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog and  to issue licences in the volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy.</p>  <p>  My Department receives applications and issues new licences every week and currently there are 3,000 felling licences with the Department for processing.  Of this total, approximately 1,000 are Coillte felling licences. Some 1,000 are private licence which require ecology input on which a backlog has developed. The remaining private licences are at various stages of processing and do not generally experience the same delays as those that require ecology input. </p>  <p>  Our overall approach to tackling this is subject to continuous improvement and review  with the aim of increasing the output of these licences on a weekly basis and there are 38 forestry inspectors, 16 ecologists and 11 administrative staff involved. </p>  <p>  By way of context, in terms of output, the total volume of  felling licences issued for 2020 was just over 5 million cubic metres, of which just under 2m cubic metres issued since the introduction of the new forestry legislation in mid-October. I am confident this positive trend will continue into 2021. </p>  <p>In terms of Natura Impact Statements (NIS), my Department has advised  that in cases where a file requires Appropriate Assessment, if an applicant supplies an NIS, this will reduce the waiting time for a licence decision.   </p></reply>

Animal welfare is high on the agenda of my Department and considerable resources and funding are provided to address the issue. In December 2020, I announced the provision of record funding of &euro;3.2 million to 101 animal welfare organisations throughout the country, many of which work with equines.  The Programme for Government contains an undertaking to make additional  funding available to animal welfare charities and urban horse welfare programmes over the coming years, to which I am fully committed. </p>  <p>  With respect to enforcement, since the enactment of the Animal Health and Welfare Act, over 100 cases have been prosecuted with a further number before the Courts.  In addition, a number of files are currently with the Chief State Solicitor with a view to instituting proceedings.   </p>  <p>  Regarding the urban horse issue, my Department continues to take a proactive approach in collaboration with Local Authorities, tackling challenges by developing facilities for urban horse populations and in educating young people in the care and welfare of horses.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department operates a confidential animal welfare helpline through which members of the public can report incidents of animal cruelty or neglect.  If any member of the public wishes to pass on details of any case of alleged neglect or cruelty that they are aware of, they will be fully investigated and appropriate actions, up to and including prosecution, may be taken. </p>  <p>  The dedicated e-mail address and Helpline for reporting suspected cases of animal welfare are:  </p>  <p>  Helpline Phone No: Call Save - 0761 064408, phone - 01 607 2379.  </p>  <p>  Email address: animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie </p></reply>

This was an increase on the figure of &euro;108m recorded in respect of 2018, and makes Canada our seventh most important non-EU destination, and seventeenth overall. The key commodities exported were beverages (&euro;77 million), dairy produce (&euro;14.7 million), pigmeat (&euro;2.3 million) and sheepmeat (&euro;6.7 million).</p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada, which has provisionally been in force since 21 September 2017, is providing further opportunities for growth in Irish agri-food exports to Canada. CETA gives the EU improved access to the Canadian market for important European export products, including cheese, wine and spirits, fruit and vegetables, and processed products.   </p>  <p>  The beverages sector is the major driver of Irish exports. Canada is now our third most important destination outside Europe, and fifth overall. In 2019, Canada imported &euro;21 million of Irish Whiskey and &euro;44m of Irish Cream exports, making it the second largest export market for Irish Cream. In addition, the fact that Canada is one of the countries where we have market access for beef, sheepmeat and pigmeat provides potential for further growth into the future. </p></reply>

The pet also required to be microchipped and vaccinated against rabies. Pet movement into an EU Member State is governed by the EU Pet Travel Regulation (EU Regulation 576/2013).</p>  <p>  In December 2020, the EU listed the UK, as non-EU Member State, among Part 2 countries for the purpose of the Pet Travel Regulation.  This does not apply to Northern Ireland, as the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol provides that NI is treated as an EU MS for the purpose of pet travel.   </p>  <p>  Part 2 listing brings extra requirements: an EU pet passport issued in Great Britain is no longer valid for travel into the EU.  Instead, a pet entering Ireland from Great Britain must be accompanied by a pet passport issued in an EU Member State, or Northern Ireland, or an EEA country.  If the pet does not have a passport issued by those authorities, it must be accompanied by a health certificate, issued by an Official Veterinarian in GB.  </p>  <p>  Pet owners are advised to retain any Great Britain-issued EU pet passport, as it may contain important information about vaccinations, treatments, etc. This passport and animal health certificate should accompany the pet during travel from Great Britain to Ireland.   </p>  <p>  Pet dogs, cats and ferrets coming from Great Britain may only enter Ireland through certain Travellers&rsquo; Points of Entry: Dublin Port, Dublin Airport, Rosslare Port, Port of Cork at Ringaskiddy, Shannon Airport and Cork Airport. Dogs travelling from, or returning from, GB to Ireland will require treatment against Echinococcus multilocularis (tapeworm) by a veterinarian 24 to 120 hours (1 to 5 days) before arrival in Ireland. This treatment may be entered into a pet passport issued by an EU MS, NI or the EEA by a UK vet.</p>  <p>  The rules for entry into GB with a pet dog, cat or ferret have not changed. EU pet passports remain valid for entry into GB. The pet must be microchipped and vaccinated against rabies. My Department recommends checking the UK&rsquo;s official advice on the entry of pets from the EU before travelling to Great Britain.</p>  <p>  My Department has issued for the past few years guidance notices directed at both the general public and Private Veterinary Practitioners on the changes Brexit would bring to pet travel between Ireland and the UK.  </p></reply>

These Regulations were welcomed by welfare organisations and put into law certain requirements for sellers and suppliers of pet animals, including minimum ages for sale of certain mammals; record-keeping; registration with the Department; and provision of certain information about the pet in advertisements.</p>  <p>  The requirement to include certain information about a pet animal in an advertisement will assist potential pet owners in deciding the appropriate seller with whom to engage.  My Department's website has further guidance for potential pet owners thinking of acquiring a pet. The Department continues to develop its controls in respect of this legislation and is advancing its plans and approach to effective enforcement - no cases have been taken before the courts to date.  </p>  <p>  My Department participates in the Irish Pet Advertising Advisory Group (IPAAG), a group formed in 2015 by a number of animal welfare organisations, veterinary professionals and classified advertising websites to address irresponsible advertising of pets online.  Officials of my Department have engaged and will continue to engage constructively with members of IPAAG, on the issue of online advertising and enforcement of the new Regulations.  IPAAG has published practical, comprehensive advice on their website for anyone thinking of acquiring a pet, including what to check for in advertisements for pet animals.  </p>  <p>  Any evidence of animal cruelty or neglect of an animal&rsquo;s welfare should be brought to the attention of my Department by calling the animal welfare helpline on 0761064408 (Call Save) or 01 6072379 or by emailing animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie.

This Article sets out: provided that TACs have been agreed, each Party shall grant vessels of the other Party access to fish in its waters in the relevant ICES sub-areas that year.  Access shall be granted at a level and on conditions determined in those annual consultations.  In relation to the main access arrangements, the Agreement also provides that the outcome of the consultations should normally result in each Party granting:   </p>  <p>  (a) access to fish stocks listed in the Annex to the Agreement - these are the stocks that are shared between the EU and UK subject to at a level that is reasonably commensurate with the parties respective shares of the TACs;</p>  <p>  (b) access to fish non- quota stocks in each other's EEZ at a level that at least equates to the average tonnage fished by that Party in the waters of the other Party during the period 2012-2016; and</p>  <p>  (c) access to waters of the Parties between 6 and 12nm in ICES divisions 4c (southern North Sea and 7d-g (English Channel, south - west coast of England and part of south - east coast of Ireland) to the extent that Union fishing vessels and UK fishing vessels had access to these waters on 31 December 2020.</p>  <p>  I have asked my Department to work to ensure that fishing vessels which traditionally fished in UK waters will be granted such access by the UK authorities. </p>  <p>  While authorisation for access for all licensed and registered fishing vessels has been sought from the UK authorities, at this time approval has been granted to tranches of fishing vessels which have been identified as requiring such access.     </p>  <p>  The UK Authorities authorised access on a staged basis initially on 31 December for 141 vessels which were identified, in consultation with the Producer Organisations, taking into account vessels that were most likely to fish in the first week of January.  The vessels were identified in the days before the end of the year taking into account the Department's understanding of the fisheries and in consultation with the four Producer Organisations (Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation,  Irish Fish Producers Organisation, Irish South &amp;amp; East Fish Producers Organisation and the Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producers Organisation).  </p>  <p>  In relation to vessels targeting mackerel in the RSW Pelagic segment and in the Polyvalent segment, these were specifically identified because mackerel is fished only in UK waters at the start of the year.  In addition for the first tranche of 141 vessels, I understand that the POs identified vessels in their organisations which they were aware of as likely to fish in the start of the year in UK waters.  </p>  <p>  Since the 31st December 2020, two further lists of Irish vessels have been sent to the Commission to request authorisation, by the UK authorities, for these vessels to fish in the 12- 200 nm UK EEZ based on licence holders who contacted the Department seeking such access and those that had fished in UK waters in 2019 or 2020 based on relevant records. A further 48 vessels have now been authorised by the UK authorities and the Department has been advised by the Commission that the second list of 20  vessels has already been transmitted to the UK authorities and is hoping to hear shortly regarding the status of this request.  The Department is considering how smaller fishing vessels that do not have a Vessel Monitoring System to record activity maybe appropriately identified and will be consulting the National Inshore Fisheries Forum in that regard.</p></reply>

This requires a two-handed approach comprised of support for our existing and potential future UK trade, as well as development of increased EU and third country market access. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, it is important to acknowledge the ongoing importance of the UK market for Irish agri-food exporters, given that it accounted for &euro;4.5 billion, or 34%, of all Irish food and drink exports in 2019. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement reached by the EU and the UK - which provides for zero tariffs and quotas - is a welcome development in this regard, and will help Irish exporters to maintain their UK market share and remain competitive against third country imports to the UK. The Government has also provided additional funding for Bord Bia's UK market activities, which include the provision of intelligence and insights, development of business opportunities with customers in key categories, and the strengthening of the reputation of Irish food and drink through consumer and trade campaigns.</p>  <p>  My Department has also been very active in the development of third country markets, for example through Trade Missions - which were carried out virtually in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic - and through the leveraging of our network of agricultural attach&eacute;s worldwide. We are also continuing to work on the opportunities provided by recent EU Free Trade Agreements with third countries, and to press for the removal of technical market access barriers across a range of third country markets. </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the broader impact of Brexit on our agriculture and food sector and configure measures to support these sectors as required.    </p></reply>

Consequently, there should be no public access to sales rings, in line with Level 5 measures. Marts may conduct sales using online platforms or through a tender process. Buyers are permitted to view animals in marts before sale, socially distanced and by prior appointment with the relevant mart. Marts must prevent the congregation of members of the public in the mart car park or at entry ways into mart buildings. My Department will continue to monitor the situation, and to adapt measures applied to marts in line with public health guidelines</p>  <p>  Throughput from 22nd October to 30th November shows how well marts and farmers adapted to sales under Level 5 measures:  in that period cattle throughput was at 84% of the comparable period for 2019 (186,317 v 221,234 head), and sheep throughput was at 83% of the comparable period for 2019 (135,881 v 164,330 sheep).</p>  <p>  In addition to the high throughput figures, it was reported that clearance rates were good and prices were robust. </p></reply>

Total beef consumption in the EU is estimated at 6.5 million tonnes.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to closely monitor the level of beef imports into the EU as an important factor in the overall supply balance in the EU market. </p>  <p>  With regard to imports from the Mercosur bloc in particular, at the Informal (virtual) meeting of Agri-Fish Ministers on 16 November, I took the opportunity to again raise concerns about the very negative impact that the EU-Mercosur agreement could have on Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. Ireland&rsquo;s position in relation to the impact of the Mercosur trade deal on Irish agriculture has been reiterated many times throughout the process, formally and informally, at political and official levels, on our own part and in close cooperation with Member State colleagues.   </p>  <p>  The inclusion of a significant Tariff Rate Quota for Mercosur beef in the final agreement underlines these economic concerns, and there are also very serious sustainability issues, among others, that need to be adequately addressed. </p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the headline political agreement of 28th June 2019, the Deputy will be aware that a whole-of-government review of the impact on Ireland was announced.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in collaboration with my Department, commissioned Implement Consulting Group to carry out an Economic and Sustainability Impact Assessment for Ireland.  I expect this review to be completed shortly, and it will inform the Government&rsquo;s position in relation to the ratification of the agreement. </p></reply>

A further 48 vessels have now been authorised by the UK authorities and the Department has been advised by the Commission that the second list of 20 vessels has already been transmitted to the UK authorities and is hoping to hear shortly regarding the status of this request.

This compares the quota shares allocated to Ireland in 2020 and the corresponding new quota shares for 2021-2016. The Deputy will see from this document that reductions in the Annexes to the Agreement are graduated over the 5.5 year period of reciprocal access, but the largest part of the reduction, 60%, is between 2020 and 2021.</p></reply>

The CFP provides the framework for the long term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks and is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters. The CFP utilises the best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas.</p>  <p>  The CFP is reviewed every 10 years and the next review is scheduled to be completed by 31 December 2022 when the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP.  The EU Commission has advised that it intends to commence the Common Fisheries Policy review process following clarity on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  The review is expected to be detailed and comprehensive.  At EU level, it is expected that all stakeholders will have an opportunity to engage actively in the review work including the fishing industry, eNGOs and Member States.   </p>  <p>  The share allocation of stocks between Member States was established as a principle of the first CFP in 1983 and was based on the average catch of each Member State over a period of reference years (track record).  The only exception to this relates to the Hague Preferences, on the basis of a special recognition agreement of the underdeveloped nature of the Irish fleet and the heavy control responsibility on us when Ireland joined the EU. The Hague Preferences give Ireland an increased share of traditional stocks (cod, whiting, haddock, sole and plaice) when Total Allowable Catch (TAC) levels reduce below a specified level.</p>  <p>  Any change to the existing system of quota allocations would require a majority of Member States to agree under the qualified majority voting system. This would require other Member States to give up existing quota shares. Any change to relative stability would involve a loss for some other  Member States and therefore poses particular challenges in a qualified majority voting context.</p>  <p>  I will consider how Ireland will prepare for and participate actively and effectively in the upcoming review of the CFP, including the interaction with stakeholders, to prepare Ireland's case and identify priorities.  I have previously stated that I am committed to doing all possible through the review of the CFP to secure additional quota where possible for Irish fishers.  The Programme for Government sets down an ambitious programme of actions that promote a sustainable seafood industry and we are committed to working to continue to build on the progress that has been made to secure a sustainable future for our fishing industry and the coastal communities which depend upon it. </p></reply>

This Article sets out: provided that TACs have been agreed, each Party shall grant vessels of the other Party access to fish in its waters in the relevant ICES sub-areas that year.  Access shall be granted at a level and on conditions determined in those annual consultations.  In relation to the main access arrangements, the Agreement also provides that the outcome of the consultations should normally result in each Party granting:</p><p>(a) access to fish stocks listed in the Annex to the Agreement - these are the stocks that are shared between the EU and UK subject to at a level that is reasonably commensurate with the parties respective shares of the TACs;</p><p>(b) access to fish non- quota stocks in each others EEZ's at a level that at least equates to the average tonnage fished by that Party in the waters of the other Party during the period 2012-2016; and</p><p>(c) access to waters of the Parties between 6 and 12nm in ICES divisions 4c (southern North Sea and 7d-g (English Channel, south-west coast of England and part of south - east coast of Ireland) to the extent that Union fishing vessels and UK fishing vessels had access to these waters on 31 December 2020.</p><p>I have asked my Department to work to ensure that fishing vessels which traditionally fished in UK waters will be granted such access by the UK authorities. </p><p>While authorisation for access for all licensed and registered fishing vessels has been sought from the UK authorities, at this time approval has been granted to tranches of fishing vessels which have been identified as requiring such access.</p><p>The UK Authorities authorised access on a staged basis initially on 31 December for 141 vessels which were identified, in consultation with the Producer Organisations, taking into account vessels that were most likely to fish in the first week of January.

Funding of &euro;44m has been approved to just under 600 organisations to date and the payment processes for this funding remain ongoing. The Stability Fund is now closed for further applications.</p>  <p>  The Rural Development Investment Programme   is being tailored to address the emerging challenges associated with COVID-19.  This includes schemes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme through which Local Authorities were provided with grant funding for interventions that helped local communities respond to the challenges associated with COVID-19 and to help support the economic and social recovery of our rural towns and villages. The 2020 Town and Village Scheme has now closed. However, details of the 2021 Scheme will be circulated to all Local Authorities when it is launched later this year. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with relevant stakeholders, including the Community and Voluntary sector,  Local Authorities and Local Development Companies, to support community organisations across the country as they deal with the ongoing and emerging challenges presented by COVID-19.   I would encourage all groups to engage with their Local Authority and Local Development Company so that they are aware of funding opportunities as they become available. </p>  <p>  Information on all funding available through my Department can be found on my Department's website.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of each local authority to maintain the register of dog breeding establishments in its functional area.  The Act also places an obligation on any person seeking to operate a dog breeding establishment to have the premises included on the register.</p><p>In July 2018, following a public consultation, my Department published revised guidelines for Dog Breeding Establishments.  These came into effect on 1 January 2019 following widespread publicity, including using press releases and social media, there was no additional spend.  Each local authority is responsible for the monitoring of these standards with regard to the registration of such establishments.</p><p>Each year my Department publishes annual statistics on gov.ie in respect of a range of dog control responsibilities of local authorities, including the statistics sought.  Information up to and including 2019 is available at the following link<i>https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/879d4c-dog-control-statistics/</i></p><p>Under the Control of Dogs Acts, local authorities are responsible for licensing services in their areas and my Department is not involved in this operational activity.</p><p>It is a legal requirement for all dog owners to have a dog licence. In 2018, to make it easier to purchase a licence, local authorities rolled out a new online system for the purchase of dog licences. Licences can now be purchased online, at Post Offices or at local authority offices.This initiative demonstrates the commitment of local authorities to driving efficiencies and modernising to meet the needs of citizens. Furthermore, I understand that mobile access and reporting facilities, which will assist detection and evasion, will also be enabled for the local authority dog warden service.</p><p>I understand from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), which has policy responsibility for the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 63/2015), that it has no plans currently to centralise microchip databases. Under the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015, four companies are authorised by DAFM to operate dog identification databases. These companies are legally required to provide certain details regarding the microchips registered with them to Europetnet, a group of national and local associations throughout Europe that register information about pets that have been uniquely identified.  A person can enter a chip number into Europetnet to establish whether the chip is a valid number.  Certain persons such as dog wardens and those who microchip dogs have access through this portal to the databases to enable the identification of microchipped dogs - including information about their registered owners. </p><p>As the Department with responsibility in the area, DAFM has indicated that no fines have been issued in respect of the selling of pets and the Animal Health and Welfare (Sale and Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations 2019.</p></reply>
