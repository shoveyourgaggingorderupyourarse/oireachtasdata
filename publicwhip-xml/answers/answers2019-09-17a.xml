The Minister for Justice and Equality, Charles Flanagan TD, represented the Government at the remembrance ceremony in Dublin. </p><p>The Government stands in solidarity with all those who lost loved ones or were injured on that day, and who suffer still as a result of these bombings. </p><p>The implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is a priority for the Government, as highlighted in the Programme for a Partnership Government. </p><p>The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government.</p><p>These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.</p><p>The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions. We have consistently raised the issue with the British Government on a bilateral basis, including at the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference, most recently on 8 May. </p><p>I and Minister Flanagan made clear to our counterparts at the Conference that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government, and that there remains an urgent need for a response.  </p><p>The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on this request, at senior political level and in official level engagement by my Department, to pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House and until a resolution is found. </p><p>The Government maintains a close and cooperative relationship with Justice for the Forgotten, as we continue work to seek the full facts of the appalling events of 25 May 1974 and of other attacks in this jurisdiction during the Troubles.</p></reply>

Officers and their dependents travel and live for extended periods of time in over ninety locations around the world. There are particular security challenges in some locations and access to timely and reliable information is essential.</p><p>As part of a suite of measures to enhance the safety and security of officers posted overseas, my Department recently published a tender seeking global security and medical advice.  This investment is important given the expansion of the Embassy network under the Global Ireland 2025 Strategy including to parts of the world where the security situation can be dynamic and uncertain. The successful service provider will assist my Department in strengthening the mitigation of particular security and medical risks in these locations.  </p><p>The principal focus of the security service is specialised international security advice and assistance for our officers and their dependents before and during travel abroad. The particular services referred to by the Deputy are additional services not specified in the Tender, but which may be required from time to time over the course of the contract. </p><p>These specialised services will complement and not replace the valuable and comprehensive supports provided to my Department by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  This includes advice and measures to protect officers and state assets abroad and for the evacuation of Irish citizens in consular emergencies.  <b></b></p><p>The Department estimates that the security advice and assistance provided by the successful tenderer may cost &euro;225,000 excluding VAT over the three &ndash; year term of the contract.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-17a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091700068#WRB01500"><p>I refer to my response to Parliamentary Question 62 of 18 June 2019, which sets out a possible path to reaching the 0.7% target by 2030. </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) is an essential element of our overall foreign policy and national presence overseas, enabling Ireland to respond to complex human needs and humanitarian crises around the world. Peer reviews by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have consistently stated that Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation programme is of the highest quality. </p><p>Along with a group of like-minded countries, including other EU partners, the Government remains committed to making incremental, sustainable progress towards achieving the UN target of 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) by 2030.  The Programme for Government states that &ldquo;we will continue to make progress towards achieving the UN target of 0.7% of gross national product for ODA, as economic conditions allow and resources permit&rdquo;.</p><p>The Government reaffirmed its commitment to delivering 0.7% of GNI to ODA by 2030 in its Global Ireland Strategy. Ireland's new policy for international development, A Better World, was launched earlier this year and provides the framework for that expansion. In order to achieve this ambition difficult choices will be required between competing priorities, especially if economic circumstances change, and this will require ongoing careful planning and consultation with other Government Departments and stakeholders if a steady, phased and prudent approach is to be achieved.</p><p>Based on current projections for economic growth, which may change as circumstances evolve, achieving the 0.7% target by 2030 would mean more than tripling the current allocations to ODA, and require sustained, substantial managed increments given that the point of departure is 0.3% of GNI this year.  </p><p>The Government is already making progress, having increased allocations to official development assistance by 32% since 2014. Budget 2019 saw the highest increase in funding available in over a decade, with Irish official development assistance in 2019 forecast to reach almost &euro;817 million, an increase of approximately &euro;110 million and a 16% increase on the allocation announced in budget 2018.</p><p>Further sustained, managed increments will be required to deliver on the 0.7% commitment by 2030, taking into consideration the range of demands across Government and the capacity of the public finances to meet them.</p><p>I can send the Deputy in writing a table which sets out indicative allocations to ODA, based on current economic growth forecasts, which show a possible phased path to reaching the 0.7% target by 2030. Allocations will of course be made annually as part of the normal budgetary process.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>ODA level &euro; Million </th><th>Expected ODA/GNI % Target </th></tr><tr><td>2019 </td><td>817 </td><td>0.30% </td></tr><tr><td>2023 </td><td>1400 </td><td>0.50% </td></tr><tr><td>2025 </td><td>1800 </td><td>0.57% </td></tr><tr><td>2027 </td><td>2100 </td><td>0.62% </td></tr><tr><td>2030 </td><td>2500 </td><td>0.70% </td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-17a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091700068#WRB01800"><p>The recent flare-up of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel along the Lebanese border is very worrying. It is the responsibility of all concerned to show restraint and de-escalate tensions when they arise, and to respect the sovereignty of their neighbours. I am relieved to see that the situation appears to have calmed in recent weeks. </p>  <p>  Of course, both Lebanon and Syria remain officially in a state of war with Israel, with the most serious recent conflict taking place in 2006. While this situation persists, the risk of tensions leading to serious violence cannot be ruled out. Ireland believes that an end to conflict, and to the formal state of war, is very much in the best interests of the entire region.  The presence of Irish troops deployed to UNIFIL along the border make this a matter of particular concern for Ireland.</p>  <p>  I am aware of reports that Israel is responsible for recent attacks on Iranian targets in Iraq and along the Iraq-Syria border. Ireland does not have independent sources of information on this so I will not comment on the accuracy of these reports. I would not support or condone attacks of this nature, which risk further destabilising a region where hundreds of thousands have been killed in conflict, and where groups such as Islamic State remain ready to take advantage of the situation to pursue their horrifying activities. </p>  <p>  Iran&rsquo;s activities in the region, not least in Syria in support of the Assad regime, also constitute a major destabilising factor which merit strong condemnation. I have personally made clear these views to the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland. </p>  <p>   I also repeat my call on all regional actors to show restraint and refrain from any escalatory actions, which could further undermine regional stability, as well as add to the suffering of civilians.</p></reply>

In 2018, my Department provided assistance to Irish citizens in over 2,343 serious consular cases. Regrettably this included assistance in over 292 cases where citizens died abroad.</p><p>A new Consular Strategy 2019-2022 was launched in May, with a focus on ensuring a high standard of customer care continues to be delivered to Irish citizens. </p><p>I recognise that there is a risk that this work can impact on staff well-being and welfare, particularly when dealing with highly sensitive consular cases. The nature of the work requires a comprehensive range of measures to support officers. </p><p>The Consular Division of the Department includes a number of skilled and trained staff who can provide support to colleagues who are based overseas. Formal debriefing and supervision is provided routinely for those who are assisting in complex and distressing cases. Consular Division is also currently running a pilot mental health support programme for staff with St Patrick&rsquo;s Mental Health Services.</p><p>Prior to taking up a posting overseas, staff are provided with comprehensive training in the management of consular cases. The support is provided by experienced consular assistance managers who have themselves undertaken mental health courses. Training and advice is also provided by organisations such as the Rape Crisis Centre, the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust and the Irish Hospice Foundation.</p><p>In addition, my Department retains a support service operated by an external provider, Workplace Options, for all posted staff and their families. The service provides confidential<b></b>welfare advice and counselling on a twenty four-hour basis. </p><p>The Civil Service Employee Assistance Service (CSEAS) more generally has a wide range of free and confidential supports to staff. The Department&rsquo;s Employee Assistance Officer, based in Dublin, provides advice to colleagues who are based overseas. </p><p>I am confident that the range of workplace supports provided is comprehensive in assisting staff to manage complex and challenging consular cases.</p></reply>

In April this year, the EU also raised human rights concerns with China at both the annual EU-China Summit and the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. Ireland and the EU regularly raise human rights concerns at multilateral level, in particular at the Human Rights Council, the current session of which is underway in Geneva. Ireland also participated in China&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review last November, calling for China to respect freedom of religion and belief. </p>  <p>  With regards to Hong Kong, Ireland and the EU have been consistent in our support for the One Country, Two Systems principle. </p>  <p>  As I have noted previously in this House, Ireland supports the right to peaceful assembly as an important element of democracy, and has consistently encouraged restraint from violence and has encouraged engagement in inclusive dialogue. </p>  <p>  The EU, with the support of Ireland, has issued statements in response to developments in Hong Kong. The most recent statement was released on the 17 August by High Representative Mogherini on behalf of the EU. This statement called for urgent steps to be taken to de-escalate the situation, and for all key stakeholders to engage in a broad-based and inclusive dialogue. During the current session of the Human Rights Council on 10 September, the EU also expressed support for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights' call for the demonstrations to remain peaceful and for the respect of fundamental rights and freedoms, including the freedom of assembly.</p>  <p>  In that regard, the recent overtures towards dialogue from the Chief Executive are a welcome move.</p>  <p>  The Consulate General of Ireland in Hong Kong, along with the EU Office and representatives of other EU Member States, have been engaging regularly with the Hong Kong authorities and will continue to monitor developments. </p></reply>

The Taoiseach has highlighted the value Ireland places on this, voicing concerns regarding the fires and urging the Brazilian Government to honour its environmental commitments under the Paris Agreement, a key element of the EU Mercosur trade deal.  </p>  <p>  The Mercosur Agreement includes a detailed chapter on the Sustainable Development Goals and recognises the need to address climate change, as well as underscoring the importance of both Parties implementing provisions of the Paris Agreement. </p>  <p>  I welcome the action taken by President Bolsonaro to address this crisis, including mobilising the army to tackle the fires and introducing a 60-day ban on setting fires. Representatives of several affected countries in the region met in Colombia earlier this month to discuss the crisis. The 'Leticia Amazon pact' signed by the group aims to increase regional coordination and step up efforts to tackle the crisis, and I discussed the situation with the Foreign Minister of Colombia, Carlos Holmes Trujillo Garc&iacute;a, whom I meet earlier today. </p>  <p>  The group was joined at the meeting by leaders of indigenous communities affected by deforestation and the fires in the Amazon. It is important that these groups are engaged on this issue, and I am deeply concerned by the reports of threats, intimidation and violence against environmental and indigenous rights defenders in Brazil, and across the wider Latin America region. </p>  <p>  Support for human rights defenders and an open civil society space is a cornerstone of Ireland's foreign policy. The Ambassador of Ireland to Brazil, Se&aacute;n Hoy, visited the Amazon region in July and met with local government representatives and civil society organisations. </p>  <p>  Addressing the challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and deforestation requires effective multilateral cooperation, and Ireland continues to engage on this issue at the EU and international level. This engagement takes place through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. Ireland provides support to a number of UNFCCC instruments that contribute financing to deforestation reduction and reforestation activities. </p></reply>

While the social, economic and political stresses arising from the crisis are very considerable, it is essential that humanitarian and legal obligations continue to be met. The new Italian Government is considering the Italian position on access for NGO ships.<b></b>Following agreement on redistribution with other Member States, Italy allowed people, from the Ocean Viking ship, to disembark in Lampedusa at the weekend. I was also pleased to note that the new Government in its programme for Government has indicated that it will revise the &lsquo;Security and Migration&rsquo; legislation introduced by former Minister Salvini under the previous administration.</p><p>Migration remains a difficult issue within the Union where views can often be sharply divided. There are countries which have been required to take in large numbers of asylum seekers and others who continue to resist taking in any. We have consistently called for all EU Member States to play their part in burden-sharing and to help to relieve pressure on front-line Member States like Italy and Malta. </p><p>The dignity and human rights of those rescued at sea must be respected. Savings lives at sea is a major priority for my Department and this Government. Ireland has been active in Search and Rescue missions in the Mediterranean since 2015. The Irish Naval Service has rescued more than 17,500 people since the beginning of the crisis. </p><p>In addition, Ireland has provided humanitarian assistance in solidarity with other Member States on separate occasions by making pledges to take migrants who were rescued in the Mediterranean Sea and to process their applications for international protection. </p><p>Since 2015, Ireland has admitted over 2,500 people under the EU Relocation Programme and the UNHCR-led refugee Resettlement Programme.</p><p>But I believe we need to move from an ad hoc approach and Ireland is working with our EU partners to resolve the migration issue and find more sustainable solutions. We believe the solution will involve consensus among Member States based on solidarity and responsibility. Ireland supports measures to address the root causes of irregular migration, through humanitarian and developmental programmes in origin and transit countries and closer political, economic and development relationships between the EU and its neighbouring countries.</p></reply>

More than four years into the conflict, Yemen is the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis, with almost 80% of the population in need of humanitarian assistance. Ireland supports the efforts of the UN Special Envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths to bring about a political resolution to the crisis in Yemen, including his efforts to ensure implementation of the 2018 Stockholm agreement between the Government of Yemen and the Houthi de facto authorities. </p>  <p>   I am very conscious that this is a multifaceted and extremely complex conflict, involving a number of local, regional and international power struggles, often rooted in Yemen&rsquo;s historical divisions. The persistence of the conflict risks leading to further fragmentation, and I support efforts to resolve these issues. Unfortunately, recent efforts in Saudi Arabia involving the Government of Yemen and southern militia groups do not appear to have made progress. </p>  <p>   Ireland has raised concerns about the situation in Yemen in our bilateral contacts with a number of third states which are involved in the conflict there, including Saudi Arabia and UAE, and also Iran. In these contacts, we have emphasised the need for an end to human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law, and for full and unfettered humanitarian access. Most recently, for example, my officials raised our concerns about the situation in Yemen with the Saudi Ambassador in Ireland, during a meeting held last week. </p>  <p>  Illicit and irresponsible arms flows fuel violence and organised crime, terrorism and conflicts, thwarting sustainable development and crisis management efforts. Ireland does not have our own independent sources of information on illicit arms flows to non-state actors in Yemen, but we support international efforts to tackle and monitor illicit arms flows, through our support for the effective implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty, the 2018 EU Strategy on Small Arms and Light Weapons and the EU sponsored iTrace project. All EU member states have signed up to the Arms Trade Treaty, which exists to ensure that arms sales do not fuel conflicts, and to prevent arms from falling into the hands of non-state actors. </p>  <p>  Those countries which do have arms industries have a particular responsibility to ensure that arms do not ultimately fall into the wrong hands. If arms sold to Saudi Arabia have fallen into the hands of terrorists or non-state actors, obviously this would be a matter of deep concern.</p>  <p>  Ireland takes every opportunity to press for a political solution to the crisis in Yemen, and for an end to violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and for unfettered humanitarian access to Yemen. Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;22 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen, including a contribution of &euro;5 million this year. Ireland will continue to do what we can to assist the political and humanitarian effort in Yemen, through supporting the efforts of the UN, as well as advocating for an end to the conflict in our bilateral contacts.</p></reply>

Recognition by Ireland will also undoubtedly affect Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing influence on the Middle East Peace Process at EU and international level, and it is imperative that it does not diminish Ireland&rsquo;s impact without delivering a commensurate benefit for the Palestinian people. </p><p>I have stated that I will be ready to recommend immediate recognition of the State of Palestine to the Government, if and when I believe it would be helpful in achieving our objective of a free and sovereign Palestinian State, or advancing the peace process in that direction. I have not yet concluded that it would be helpful at this time, but situations change, and I keep this matter under continuous and active review. </p><p>Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including the UN Charter. The EU has reiterated, on numerous occasions, that it will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties. With regard to the comments which Prime Minister Netanyahu made last week about the Jordan Valley, I would not usually comment on what is said in the course of an election campaign. However, due to the gravity of the issue in this case, I felt it was important to make my views known. I also directed my officials to speak to the Israeli Ambassador and to request that he convey Ireland&rsquo;s position directly to his authorities. Ireland and the EU will monitor closely the actions of the next Israeli Government.</p><p>Ireland remains fully committed to the resolution of the Middle East conflict, through an agreed settlement which includes the establishment of a sovereign State of Palestine recognized by all, living side by side in peace with the State of Israel, bringing to an end to the occupation that began in 1967. All of my actions on this issue are taken in pursuit of that objective.</p></reply>

In November 2017, my Department launched the National Plan on Business and Human Rights 2017 -2020 to give effect to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The aim of the Plan is to promote responsible business practices at home and overseas by all Irish business enterprises in line with Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights globally. The Plan is directed at Government and State agencies, Irish companies operating at home and overseas, and multinational enterprises operating in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The establishment of the Business and Human Rights Implementation Group was a key commitment of the National Plan. The Implementation Group, established in December 2018, is mandated to meet at least twice per year. I was pleased to be able to participate in the inaugural meeting of the Group on 16 January 2019.  The Implementation Group went on to hold its first working meeting on 3 April 2019 and is scheduled to meet again in October. </p>  <p>  My Department and I will continue to monitor this situation closely and engage with relevant stakeholders on the important issues raised by civil society groups regarding the mine.</p></reply>

I continued this engagement over the summer months and I remain in regular and ongoing contact with Secretary of State Smith (we met most recently yesterday), to work to secure agreement between the parties to get all of the institutions of the Agreement up and running again. </p>  <p>  All five political parties have engaged constructively in the talks process with that objective over the last number of months. Progress has been made across a range of important issues. However, some key outstanding issues remain and finding final agreement on these issues will require genuine and courageous dialogue and leadership by the party leaders in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The awful murder of Lyra McKee and the outpouring of public feeling that followed demands a serious response at political level. People want the devolved power-sharing institutions up and running again to represent their interests and deal with the issues and challenges that Northern Ireland faces at present, not least the difficulties raised by the UK exit from the European Union. The functioning of the North South Ministerial Council is also urgently required, to bring together the Executive and the Government to oversee and develop co-operation on the island, and as a vital part of the Good Friday Agreement. </p>  <p>  In this context, the political parties, in particular the two largest parties, must live up to their responsibilities and be open to fair and workable compromises on the small number of outstanding issues, to secure the overall interests of people in Northern Ireland and to protect and operate the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement again. </p>  <p>  This will be difficult, but the two Governments believe that this can, and must, be achieved. Accordingly, the Government will continue to do everything possible to support continuing engagement and progress in discussions between the political parties, working with the UK Government in any scenario, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

Citizens in Bahrain are living in an increasingly restrictive society and there has been further erosion of fundamental freedoms in recent years, including freedom of opinion and expression.</p>  <p>  I was alarmed to learn of the executions of three people in July, including two human rights activists. A moratorium on the death penalty had been in place in Bahrain since 2010, and we saw the resumption of capital punishment in Bahrain in 2017 as a very negative development. Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy, and we condemn the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Along with our EU partners, Ireland calls on Bahrain to again introduce a moratorium on executions, as a step towards the abolition of the death penalty.</p>  <p>  Through our interventions at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) Ireland has sought to ensure that the human rights situation in Bahrain, and in other locations where we have concerns, remains in focus. Ireland has repeatedly raised human rights concerns in Bahrain at the HRC in recent Item 4 Statements ("human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention"). For example, in September 2018, Ireland expressed concerns about the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders, and called on Bahrain to respect freedom of opinion and expression, and in February 2019, we reiterated that concern at the ongoing detention of human rights defenders. At the last HRC session in June/July 2019, Ireland called on Bahrain to ensure respect for freedom of opinion and expression and the right to a fair trial. At the most recent HRC Universal Periodic Review of Bahrain's human rights record in 2017, Ireland urged Bahrain to accept an open offer by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Bahrain. </p>  <p>  We have also raised the issues of human rights in Bahrain in bilateral dialogue; for example, officials from my Department met with officials from the Bahraini Embassy in March 2019 and raised our human rights concerns directly with them. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights.  We shall do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, as opportunities arise.</p></reply>

The UN is central to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy.  Our effort to secure a seat, which was announced in 2005, reflects this.  I am particularly conscious that we are seeking a seat on the Council at a time when multilateralism is being undermined.  It is my strong belief that, in these circumstances, it is important that Ireland should demonstrate its willingness to participate in the work of multilateral institutions.  I know this view is widely shared in the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  All appropriate regional, multilateral and bilateral engagements are being utilised by An Taoiseach; me, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade; Ministers across Government and by Ministers of State, to promote and discuss Ireland&rsquo;s candidature.  Officials at my Department are also fully engaged in the effort to ensure success.  Ireland last served on the Council from 2001-2002.</p>  <p>  In making our case to the 192 other Members States of the UN, we are highlighting our consistent record at the UN throughout more than six decades of active membership. We have a strong record at the UN in the areas of peacekeeping, sustainable development, humanitarian action, disarmament and human rights. </p>  <p>  The case for our candidature echoes our policy interests, our values and our history of positive engagement at the global level.  We are committed to the principles and values of the UN Charter which have stood the test of time for 74 years and we will demonstrate this commitment if we are elected to the Council.    </p>  <p>  The contest for the two seats is very competitive.  Our opponents, Canada and Norway, are strong members of the UN and important bilateral partners.  We enjoy excellent relations with both and cooperate on many issues at the UN and beyond.  Indeed, my Norwegian counterpart visited Ireland just last month and I had the opportunity to meet with her to discuss a range of issues of mutual interest. </p>  <p>  Later this month I will travel to the 74th session of the UN General Assembly with the President, and the Taoiseach. The UN is organising five Summits in as many days, addressing Climate, Financing for Development, Health, Small Island Developing States and the Sustainable Development Goals.  In addition to participating in the Summits, we will take the opportunity to raise the profile of our Security Council candidature with Member States. We aim to meet senior representatives of a wide range of States to press our case and seek their support at the election which is expected to take place in June 2020. In addition to those bilateral meetings, the President, Taoiseach and I will participate in events that showcase Ireland's principled and consistent foreign policy on issues such as the Middle East Peace Process, disarmament and the importance of multilateralism. Our programmes will, of course, include a number of events with important bilateral and Irish community dimensions.</p></reply>

As in my most recent meeting with Mr Barnier in Brussels on 19 July, we took stock of the ongoing talks between the EU and the UK.  The EU's strong solidarity with Ireland and its absolute commitment, notwithstanding the ongoing political impasse in the UK, to protect the Good Friday Agreement remains clear. </p>  <p>  While we welcome the intensification of discussions between the European Commission and the UK, it is the UK's responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions that are compatible with the Withdrawal Agreement.  At this point, no such proposals have yet been made, and it is important that the UK communicate their concrete ideas to the Commission on how they intend to deliver an orderly withdrawal.  </p>  <p>  I plan to meet Mr Barnier again shortly, and senior officials from my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach continue to engage with the Task Force on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  A meeting of the General Affairs Council on 16 September was attended by Minister McEntee and a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council will take place on 14 October, which I will attend. While Brexit is not formally on the agenda for these Councils, the meetings will provide a further opportunity to discuss issues relating to Brexit and other issues of mutual concern with our partners. </p>  <p>  The next meeting of the European Council will take place on 17-18 October.</p></reply>

Over time, Department websites are being moved to one single website, <i>gov.ie</i>, giving people a one stop shop for accessing information on Government services and organisations.</p><p>It is generally seen as best practice to pursue the consolidation of public service information into one consistent accessible website. </p><p>The most digitally advanced countries within the EU (see the EU eGovernment Benchmark 2018 - Denmark, Estonia, Austria, Latvia and Malta), have already moved to a single digital gateway approach. Furthermore, a 2016 market research exercise carried out by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform found that the concept of a single, online portal for government was positively received by both the general public and representative bodies alike. This view was again confirmed by a subsequent market research exercise carried out in late 2018.</p><p>Following a government decision in December 2017 to migrate all Ministerial Department websites to <i>gov.ie</i>, work has proceeded on this basis.  </p><p>So far, 5 departments have moved their website content to <i>gov.ie</i>- the Departments of the Taoiseach; Public Expenditure and Reform; Rural and Community Development; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Finance.</p><p>As a part of the migration to<i>gov.ie</i>, content from websites is reworked and moved into the <i>gov.ie</i>website (for example, efforts are made to make the services content easier to understand through the use of plain English).  Post migration, the internet addresses for the new content within <i>gov.ie</i>is different from the addresses of the content, including documents, on the old websites.</p><p>The migration of a website to a new one with a different address necessarily breaks links to the old website content from external sources.  This happens in all website migrations, including the department websites in question.  This issue is temporary in nature as search engines re-index content on the internet, and also as external sites (that are not search indexes) update their links to point to the new location of content.  </p><p>Over time, the issue of finding broken links and being redirected to a department&rsquo;s homepage on <i>gov.ie</i>will become less and less frequent, and will eventually cease to occur. </p><p>To reduce the temporary impact of the website migrations, the occurrence of visitors to broken links within <i>gov.ie</i>is monitored via site analytics. In conjunction with each department&rsquo;s content manager, work is continuously being undertaken where possible to redirect such broken links to the correct and new location within <i>gov.ie</i>. Furthermore, prior to website migration into <i>gov.ie</i>, work is undertaken to pre-emptively set up such redirects to popular content so as to reduce the likelihood of this issue arising.</p><p>Between search engine re-indexing and the ongoing efforts based on website analytics, the user experience of <i>gov.ie</i>in regards to the matter the Deputy refers will improve over time.</p></reply>

Under the Good Friday Agreement, the Secretary of State shall exercise this power "if at any time it appears likely ... that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."</p>  <p>  While the decision to hold such a poll in Northern Ireland rests with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Government does not believe it likely at present that such a border poll in the near future would result in a decision on the part of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland in favour of constitutional change. </p>  <p>  In these circumstances, it is the Government&rsquo;s clear view that such a poll would only increase uncertainty and division at an already difficult and sensitive time.</p>  <p>  The Government respects everyone&rsquo;s right on this island to make the case for the constitutional future they wish to see for Northern Ireland - whether nationalist, unionist or neither. The Good Friday Agreement - and the two sovereign Governments - explicitly recognise and validate the legitimacy of both of these constitutional positions, which are deeply held. </p>  <p>  In the absence of the prospect of a referendum in the near future, the Government has no immediate plans for specific preparations on this issue, nor has there been in the past. This includes the commissioning or formal examination by my Department of a profile of the potential costs of a United Ireland. My Department is aware of the academic and other research papers on the subject which have been published.</p>  <p>  In the event of a future referendum within the consent provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government would make all necessary preparations in accordance with the terms of the Constitution and the principles and procedures of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s immediate priorities are to secure the functioning of the devolved power-sharing institutions and the North South Ministerial Council, which are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, and to ensure the protection of the Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the Peace Process, in the context of the UK decision to exit the European Union under any scenario.</p></reply>

We consider it an imperative to seek multilateral solutions to global challenges and threats to international peace and security, including those arising from new technological developments and advancements.</p>  <p>  Ireland regards the area of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS) as one of the most pressing issues facing the disarmament agenda.  Their development and deployment raises serious ethical, moral and legal questions, with the possibility of contravening International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law, reshaping modern warfare, and exacerbating asymmetries of power between States. We believe that there is an urgent need for tangible international responses to address these challenges.</p>  <p>  The principal multilateral space for addressing these challenges  is the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on LAWS.  This is a UN body that operates by consensus.  While conscious of the difficulties in achieving consensus within the Group, Ireland believes that progress can continue to be made there and we remain committed to achieving a consensus outcome at this stage.  We welcome the outcome of the most recent GGE meeting in August 2019, whereby States agreed to endorse a set of Guiding Principles and decided to continue work for an additional two years.  The decision to extend these discussions reflects the fact that States believe further progress can be achieved within the context of the GGE. Working to achieve consensus within the UN system remains the most effective way to comprehensively address the emerging challenges posed by LAWS.  The GGE is relevant and representative because it encompasses 125 countries, including those countries most likely to develop these new weapon systems.</p>  <p>  In the short term, we see a political declaration on LAWS as the outcome most likely to secure agreement.  We also see value in developing an internationally-agreed legal instrument designed to ensure human control over autonomous weapon systems.  While a number of States have called for a pre-emptive ban, we do not see a consensus emerging in the GGE around calls for a pre-emptive ban at this stage.  We have continuously reiterated that the GGE needs, as a matter of urgency, to make substantive progress in order to ensure that technological developments do not outpace the international community&rsquo;s ability to regulate these weapons.</p>  <p>  Ireland also recognises the valuable contribution of civil society in these on-going discussions. We have funded and partnered with civil society to facilitate informal discussions among States and civil society to allow a better understanding of the commonalities that exist between States on this complex issue. We look forward to continuing our engagement with civil society in the future on this important topic.</p></reply>

During the search operation to retrieve the second bomb, in the Creggan area of Derry, the PSNI came under sustained attack from missiles and petrol bombs thrown by young people thought to be directed by older New IRA elements. In the previous week, there were also three paramilitary style attacks which have resulted in six people being injured.  </p>  <p>  Let me reiterate, there is no place and no possible justification for the use or the threat of violence on this island.  The people of this island endorsed the Good Friday Agreement making clear that the only way to change the constitutional status of Northern Ireland is by peaceful and democratic means and through consent.  I call again on those engaged in violence to cease now, your actions are repugnant to the people of this island and are counter-productive to the vision you wrongly claim to represent.</p>  <p>  This level of violence is entirely unacceptable and causes untold disruption and anxiety within communities. The people of the Derry City and Strabane District have been unequivocal in their condemnation of this violence and local politicians have been consistent in urging those responsible to get off the backs of the local communities. </p>  <p>  My officials are in regular contact with local political and community representatives as well as the PSNI and will continue this engagement during this period of increased tension.  </p>  <p>  I am in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP, and I met with him on Monday 16 September, as did my colleague the Minister for Justice Charles Flanagan. Both Governments are acutely aware that the current political vacuum is creating a situation which sinister elements such at the New IRA are seeking to exploit. We are continuing to work together on efforts to restore a functioning Executive and Assembly which will bring much needed stability for dealing with these types of threats.</p></reply>

Tyrone; and Derry city were all linked to dissident republican activity and were all intended to kill PSNI officers and risked the lives of people living in these areas.   </p>  <p>  It is well understood that dissident republicans are using the current political vacuum in Northern Ireland and uncertainty created by Brexit as an opportunity to recruit new members and to perpetuate their false narrative. An Garda S&iacute;ochana and PSNI authorities have said publicly that any border infrastructure or personnel would become targets for dissident republican paramilitaries and require police or other protection.  To be clear, the fragility in the peace process predates Brexit, but it is also clear that the Brexit process has exacerbated the regrettable polarisation that had already been occurring.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government's determination to avoid a hard border reflects our determination to protect all of the gains of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, political, economic, societal and security.  Being cognisant of these risks, the Government has been consistent in its opposition to a hard border on the island of Ireland. The consequences of a no deal Brexit for the political process in Northern Ireland could be very damaging. A no deal Brexit risks the reintroduction of some form of checks near the border which could significantly undermine wider community relations and political stability in Northern Ireland, and would bring with it significant potential related security concerns. </p>  <p>  I am continuing to work urgently and in partnership with my counterpart, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to support the restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement to full operation on a more sustainable basis, and to address key issues of division between the main parties that have affected partnership government in Northern Ireland. Having the institutions working on behalf of all the people of Northern Ireland would be an essential step to restoring positive momentum in the peace process and could make a major contribution to managing the impacts of any Brexit scenario on the island.</p>  <p>  A no deal exit will not be our choice and the only clear way to avoid this is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement. Without the Withdrawal Agreement and the backstop, there are no easy answers. There is a process of engagement between Ireland and the European Commission on how to meet, in a no deal scenario, our shared twin objectives of protecting the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it, and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. </p></reply>

I remain concerned about the detention of a number of people in Bahrain, both in respect of the grounds for detention, and their treatment by the Bahraini authorities. </p><p>Many political prisoners are being held in Jau Prison in Bahrain where there are widespread reports of bad conditions and mistreatment of prisoners, including allegations of torture. I understand that a large number of the prisoners have gone on hunger strike in response to these conditions.  </p><p><b></b>Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and continually advocates for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression. Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees and is committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. These principles feed into our bilateral dialogue; for example, officials from my Department met with officials from the Bahraini Embassy in March 2019 and raised our human rights concerns directly with them. </p><p>Ireland, as a small country, amplifies its voice on human rights issues through multilateral engagement and through measured recommendations offered as part of constructive dialogue.</p><p>Through our interventions at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) Ireland has sought to ensure that the human rights situation in Bahrain and in other locations where we have concerns, remains in focus. Ireland has repeatedly raised human rights concerns in Bahrain at the HRC in recent Item 4 Statements (&quot;human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention&quot;). For example, in September 2018, Ireland expressed concerns about the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders, and called on Bahrain to respect freedom of opinion and expression. In February 2019, Ireland reiterated concern at the ongoing detention of human rights defenders. In our most recent Item 4 statement at the Human Rights Council in June/July 2019, Ireland called on Bahrain to ensure respect for freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to a fair trial.  </p><p>At the most recent HRC Universal Periodic Review of Bahrain's human rights record in 2017, Ireland urged Bahrain to accept an open offer by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Bahrain.</p><p>With regard to the rights of prisoners and detainees in general, Ireland co-sponsored HRC Resolution 36/16, which calls upon States to &lsquo;investigate promptly, effectively and impartially all alleged human rights violations and abuses suffered by persons deprived of their liberty, in particular cases involving death, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to provide effective remedies to the victims, and to ensure that detention administrations cooperate fully with the investigating authority and preserve all evidence&rsquo;. Ireland has also co-sponsored; Resolution 30/7, concerning human rights in the administration of justice; Resolution 31/31, concerning torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; and UN General Assembly Resolution 71/188, also concerning human rights in the administration of justice. </p><p>My Department will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights.  We shall seek all opportunities to do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level.</p></reply>

The video that circulated of a number of former FARC leaders stating their intention to withdraw from the peace process is deeply troubling. However, it is understood that the vast majority of former FARC members remain committed to reincorporation and to the peace process. </p>  <p>  I would like to echo the EU statement of 29 August which underlines that the only way to properly address differences and overcome difficulties in the implementation of the peace agreement is through dialogue and political participation. As all deputies in this House are aware, building peace is a task that requires sustained engagement and the dedication of Government, those formerly engaged in the conflict, and civil society, with the support of the international community. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to provide support to the Colombian peace process through funding to international organisations, but also through lesson sharing programmes between Ireland and Colombia, based on our own experience of peace building on this island. As we know well in Ireland, the signing of a peace agreement only marks the beginning of a process. We understand the slow and painstaking work that goes into building trust between communities to enable reconciliation and to develop a culture of trust. We have had many dark moments and setbacks, and we understand that peace building is the work of generations. </p>  <p>  The opening of our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; earlier this year marked a significant moment in our relationship with Colombia, and has also enhanced our ability to provide support to the Colombian peace process. Officials at are Embassy monitor developments in this area closely and regularly engage on peacebuilding and reconciliation with the Colombian Government. </p>  <p>  My Department supported the travel of three experts from Northern Ireland to Colombia in June to engage with the Government on key elements of the peace agreement and its implementation. Officials at my Department in Dublin were also pleased to meet last week with Dr. Emilio Archila, Presidential Counsellor for Stabilisation and Consolidation of Colombia, who is responsible for the implementation of the peace accords. </p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to supporting the full implementation of the peace accords in Colombia to ensure a more peaceful future for all Colombians. I look forward to continuing to work with the Government of Colombia and with our EU partners to ensure a coordinated and effective approach that best supports the peace process.</p></reply>

Over four years of conflict have resulted in the world&rsquo;s worst humanitarian crisis, with the country&rsquo;s economy decimated and millions on the brink of famine. It is vital that we continue to push for a political resolution to the conflict that is driving this crisis. Ireland supports the efforts of the UN Special Envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, to bring about such a resolution, including his efforts to ensure implementation of the 2018 Stockholm agreement between the Government of Yemen and the Houthi de facto authorities. </p>  <p>  While the UN Special Envoy is mandated to focus his mediation efforts on the two main parties to the conflict, there are many other armed groups operating in Yemen and controlling a patchwork of areas across the country. I was very concerned to hear of a new front opening up in August in the southern port city of Aden, where forces who had previously fought against the Houthis have attacked government forces. </p>  <p>  I wish every success to efforts to promote negotiations between the Government of Yemen and southern militia groups, and I regret that the recent talks in Saudi Arabia have not yet led to success. </p>  <p>  In addition to the humanitarian crisis, the persistence of widespread human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law is particularly worrying. I have put Ireland at the centre of UN efforts to prepare the ground for accountability in the long term for what has occurred in Yemen.  Ireland is a member of the core group which helped establish the Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen at the Human Rights Council in September 2017. The Group&rsquo;s second report, released earlier this month, makes for sobering reading with conditions on the ground in Yemen having worsened. There continues to be a lack of accountability for the gross violations of international law committed by all sides. Ireland will push for a renewal of the Group&rsquo;s mandate at the Human Rights Council so that it can continue to carry out its vital work in recording and reporting on these violations. </p>  <p>  Ireland has communicated its concerns about the situation in Yemen directly to the Saudi Arabian and UAE authorities on numerous occasions. In February 2019, I relayed Ireland&rsquo;s strong views directly to the Saudi Ambassador, particularly on the safety of civilians and humanitarian access. Senior officials from my Department again conveyed Ireland's concerns to the Saudi Ambassador in a meeting last week.</p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;22 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen, including a contribution of &euro;5 million this year. Ireland will continue to do what we can to assist the political and humanitarian effort in Yemen, through supporting the efforts of the UN, as well as advocating for an end to the conflict in our bilateral contacts.</p></reply>

This is why the backstop remains an absolutely necessary part of the Withdrawal Agreement.  </p>  <p>  However, given the current political uncertainty in London, there is a significant risk of a no deal Brexit.   In the absence of a Withdrawal Agreement, there are no easy solutions. We continue our work with the European Commission to address the shared twin objectives of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and protecting the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.  </p>  <p>  Any solutions agreed will be clearly sub-optimal to the backstop. A no deal Brexit would have far-reaching consequences on the island of Ireland, with a particular impact on North-South trade, which could no longer be a frictionless as it is today.  The impact of tariffs, and of the customs and SPS requirements and associated checks necessary to preserve the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland's full participation in it, would be significant for the operation of the all-island economy, with additional costs and disruption for businesses throughout the island. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue its efforts to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process &ndash; this will never be in question. Similarly, our place in the Single Market is at the core of our economic model, and will remain so. </p></reply>

But such words are not without consequence, since they send dangerous messages and contribute to a climate of fear and insecurity among Palestinians.</p>  <p>  Annexation of territory by force is illegal under international law, including the UN Charter. Any unilateral annexation by Israel of occupied territory would have no legitimacy, and would not be recognised or accepted by Ireland or the international community more generally.</p>  <p>  The position of Ireland and the EU is clear. We will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties. It has long been proposed that a future peace agreement may involve some agreed mutual border adjustments, but such changes can only be by mutual agreement. </p>  <p>  With regard to Prime Minister Netanyahu&rsquo;s remarks last week about the Jordan Valley, I would not usually comment on what is said in the course of an election campaign. However, due to the gravity of the issue, I felt it was important to make my views known. I also directed my officials to speak to the Israeli Ambassador and to request that he convey Ireland&rsquo;s position directly to his authorities. </p>  <p>  The EU position has also been reaffirmed publicly following PM Netanyahu's comments. As set out in numerous Foreign Affairs Council conclusions, the EU will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties. The settlement policy, including in East Jerusalem, is illegal under international law. Its continuation undermines the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace. Ireland and the EU will monitor closely the actions of the next Israeli government in this context.</p></reply>

Demonstrations were triggered initially by spiralling costs of living and quickly developed into calls for ex-President al Bashir&rsquo;s resignation, after 30 years in power. Control was seized by the military who dissolved the Government and announced a takeover by the Transitional Military Council (TMC). </p>  <p>  Ireland continues to engage with our EU partners to ensure a strong and unified EU position on the situation in Sudan.  On 17 June the Foreign Affairs Council discussed how the EU could best support a peaceful transition to a civilian-led transitional Government in Sudan.  As EU, we urged all regional and international actors to play a constructive and coordinated role in support of the African Union.  We also strongly condemned the violence against protestors, including sexual and gender-based violence.  </p>  <p>  Following several months of negotiations, which took place against a backdrop of ongoing demonstrations and violence against protesters, on 17 August the military and the opposition signed an agreement to establish a transitional Government in Sudan. The EU remains fully engaged in the situation in Sudan, and as an expression of strong political support, the EU along with a number of other international partners, signed the agreement as a witness. The EU welcomed the agreement as an important milestone and called on all parties to implement it in good faith.   </p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste also warmly welcomed the signing of that agreement. He acknowledged the prominent role played by women and youth in the protests, and commended the strong engagement of the African Union and Ethiopia in mediating the talks. Together with our EU partners, Ireland will support a civilian-led political transition, which we hope will pave the way for peace, security and economic growth in Sudan.</p>  <p>  Ireland further welcomes the recent establishment of the new civilian-led transitional Government in Sudan, including the appointment of a civilian Prime Minister and the inclusion of four women in the new cabinet. It is also very positive that the African Union has recently lifted the suspension on Sudan.</p>  <p>  Sudan&rsquo;s current economic outlook is of pressing concern. Significant financial support will be required from the international community and the EU has committed to assisting Sudan in this regard.</p>  <p>  Since the crisis first erupted, senior officials from my Department have met with the Sudanese Ambassador to Ireland on a number of occasions to express Ireland&rsquo;s concerns at the political situation, most recently on 15 July. My officials have also met with members of the Sudanese community in Ireland to listen to their concerns and views on the current situation.  </p>  <p>  Ireland also took the opportunity at the 41st Session of the UN Human Rights Council in July to voice our concerns about the current human rights situation in Sudan. We particularly welcomed the inclusion in the agreement of a commitment to establish an independent and transparent investigation into the violent crackdown against protestors in Khartoum on 3 June.  </p>  <p>  My officials visited Khartoum in April, as part of Ireland's role in chairing the OCHA donor support group (the UN&rsquo;s humanitarian coordination agency), and met with many stakeholders, including representatives of the Sudanese Foreign Ministry.   Officials took the opportunity to raise concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country and the need for the timely delivery of principled humanitarian assistance and protection. Ireland continues to respond to ongoing humanitarian needs in Sudan through the provision of humanitarian funding, with almost &euro;30 million provided through our UN, NGO and Red Cross partners since 2012, including over &euro;3.5 million since</p>  <p>  the beginning of 2019.  </p>  <p>  As events evolve, my officials continue to actively monitor developments in Sudan, through Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Nairobi, and in cooperation with the EU Delegation in Khartoum.</p></reply>

This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  </p><p>The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Ms Regina Doherty, T.D. .  However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples. This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p><p>The Single Person Child Carer Credit (SPCCC) is intended to support the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  It is available to the primary claimant, who is the individual with whom the child resides for the whole or greater part of the year.  The primary claimant must be either the child's parent or the individual who has custody of the child and who maintains the child at his or her own expense for the whole or the greater part of the year.</p><p>Where the child's primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they are not entitled to the SPCCC, on the basis that the relevant child is not, in the main, being cared for by a single person, and therefore no credit is available.  </p><p>Issues concerning this credit are outlined in detail in the review of the SPCCC conducted by the Department of Finance in 2015 contained in the Report on Tax Expenditures, available online at</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that in Finance Bill 2018 I re-imposed an upper salary ceiling of &euro;1 million on the relief with effect of 1 January 2019 for new entrants and for existing beneficiaries of the programme from 1 January 2020. Such data as are available within the system relate to years before 2019 (no cap existed between 2015 and 2019). It would therefore be necessary to assess the cost-saving impact of cap as well as taking account of evolution in the take up of the relief during the current year in order to estimate the savings that might arise in 2020 from the abolition of the programme.</p>  <p>  SARP is currently the subject of an independent review, carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. I expect to receive that review shortly and it will inform any decisions I make in relation to the relief in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill.</p></reply>

The CPC sets out requirements around information which must be provided to a mortgage borrower prior to taking out the mortgage, and establishes timeframes for assessing mortgage applications. The CPC also imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  </p>  <p>  With respect to arrears handling, the protections of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 may apply to a buy-to-let mortgage if the mortgage relates to a residential property which is the only residential property owned by the borrower in the State. Otherwise, the arrears handling provisions of the CPC apply, including the requirement that the regulated entity must seek to agree the approach that will assist the consumer in resolving the arrears.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 provide a framework within which lenders in the European Union must operate and applies to relevant credit agreements that come into effect after 21 March 2016, including buy-to-let mortgages.  The Regulations set out further requirements on provision of information and creditworthiness assessments.  </p>  <p>  The Consumer Credit Act 1995 (CCA) also includes requirements for housing loans, including buy-to-let mortgages. Under the CCA, lenders must include a summary of prescribed information relating to the loan on the front page of the loan agreement.</p>  <p>  I currently have no plans to make changes in relation to the suite of protections that apply to buy-to-let mortgage holders.</p></reply>

No. 6 of 2018).  PSD2 is supplemented by a European Commission Delegated Regulation (2018/389) with regard to regulatory technical standards for strong customer authentication.</p>  <p>  These rules on strong customer authentication protect consumers and other users of payment services. They provide stronger protection against fraud, particularly online card fraud. Strong customer authentication is based on the use of two independent elements which must come from two of the three categories of possession, knowledge and inheritance. Chip and PIN, for example, relies on the chip on a payment card (something you have) and a PIN (something you know) to perform strong customer authentication. For this reason, sales in physical shops already comply with the requirements and it is in online ecommerce sales that a change will be seen.</p>  <p>  The deadline set for compliance with the regulatory technical standards on strong customer authentication was 14 September 2019. The Central Bank of Ireland, however, stated in a notice on 8 August that it recognised the difficulties with meeting this deadline. In line with the opinion of the European Banking Authority published in June, it announced that a limited migration period would be put in place for firms it regulates. The migration period relates to ecommerce transactions only and is being put in place to ensure no disruption to payments systems from 14 September.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has been engaging with the industry to develop a migration plan to implement strong customer authentication for ecommerce transactions as soon as possible after this date. It has stated that it will continue to engage with the European Banking Authority and other National Competent Authorities in the European Union in relation to this issue, aiming to agree a harmonised approach to the migration time periods across the European Union. The Central Bank has committed to continue to communicate on this issue and an announcement on the new deadline may be expected shortly.</p></reply>

The establishment of the FSPO resulted from the merger of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Ombudsman&rsquo;s Bureau.  </p><p>The Ombudsman has informed me that the FSPO inherited 3,178 complaints from its predecessor bodies.  5,692 complaints were received in 2018 and 4,178 new complaints were received up to and including 9 September 2019.  </p><p>In 2018, the office closed 4,443 complaints leaving a balance of 4,427 complaints on hand at the end of 2018. Up to 9 September this year the office has closed 3,242 complaints.  </p><p>To answer the Deputy's question as to the number of complaints received (4,178), the percentage and number closed up to 9 September 2019 the Ombudsman has provided the following information:-</p><p><table><tr><th>Months</th><th>Number of Complaints</th><th>% of total (4,178) received that were closed</th></tr><tr><td>Within 2 months</td><td>241</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>Within 4 months</td><td>311</td><td>5%</td></tr><tr><td>Within 6 months</td><td>201 </td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>Over 6 months</td><td>49</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>802</td><td>19%</td></tr></table></p><p>In light of the backlog, earlier this year I sanctioned an additional 35 staff members. This will allow for delivery of a better faster service for consumers while tackling existing waiting times.  It will also aid the delivery of the objectives set out in the FSPO Strategic Plan 2018 &ndash; 2021.  Recruitment for these additional resources has already commenced, with an initial tranche of new staff joining the organisation in September 2019.</p><p>On the issue more generally, the Ombudsman has also informed me that new complaints are dealt with in sequence based on the date they were received by the office.  While the high volume of complaints received has impacted the complaint registration process and has given rise to delays at various stages of the process, it is important to note that the duration required to register, mediate, or investigate a complaint can vary depending on the number and nature of submissions made by the parties to the complaint. This sometimes involves an extensive exchange of evidence and submissions. At all stages of the process, each complaint is considered on its own merits. </p><p>I understand that the FSPO wrote to all members of the Houses of the Oireachtas informing them of the Protocol for the Provision of Information to Members of the Oireachtas by State Bodies and providing a dedicated email address for the timely provision of information to members of the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

My predecessor introduced a provision in Finance Act 2016 to enable the exclusion of an agricultural sector from the flat-rate scheme where the Minister is satisfied that, because of the business structures, contractual arrangements or models in place, the application of the flat-rate addition within that sector has resulted in, and would otherwise continue to result in, a systematic excess of flat-rate addition payments over input costs incurred by flat-rate farmers in that sector. </p>  <p>  My officials are currently in the process of considering a report received from Revenue on the operation of the flat-rate addition scheme in the poultry sector. </p>  <p>  To date, Revenue has not established that similar business models and contractual arrangements exist or are common in any other agricultural sector and the correspondence referred to does not present any evidence of such arrangements.  A flat-rate farmer involved in a business in which cattle are bought from other flat-rate farmers and reared for a further limited period before being supplied to a VAT registered business such as a beef processor would normally receive a flat-rate addition payment  that exceeded his or her VAT input cost; however, the payment might not exceed the total VAT input costs associated with rearing the animal incurred by all the farmers involved in the process. It would be expected that the price paid to flat-rate farmers supplying to another flat-rate farmer would take account of the flat-rate &lsquo;credit&rsquo; being transferred with the animal.

The legislation introduced a specific measure relating to Duty Free sales between Ireland and the UK in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal. The provision contained in the Act was designed as a contingency measure in that it was anticipated that a solution to such matters would form part of a future relationship agreement between the EU and UK. </p><p>In the Act, I made provision to impose restrictions on duty-free sales in Ireland to UK bound travellers, which I planned to implement if the UK introduced similar restrictions in respect of Ireland bound travellers in the UK. As the UK has now decided to apply an unrestricted duty-free scheme in the event of a no-deal Brexit and in line with this reciprocal policy, Ireland will not now commence the relevant legislative measure and European Union rules, in relation to passenger travel between the EU and third countries, would therefore apply from 31 October.  In effect this would mean that Excise and VAT free sales on purchases of tobacco and alcohol made at duty-free shops, subject to quantitative purchase limits, would therefore operate between Ireland and the UK.  </p><p>Passengers from the United Kingdom will however, only be entitled to bring goods into Ireland without payment of tax and duties, within prescribed limits.  The total value of the goods may not exceed &euro;430 (&euro;215 in the case of a traveller under 15 years of age), and quantitative limits will apply to excisable products (alcohol and tobacco).  The quantitative limits are set out in the attached table (see table A) and the enforcement of these limits will be an operational matter for Revenue.</p><p>This policy is in compliance with EU law and Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations.</p><p>Table A: Quantitative limits on excisable UK duty free entering EU<table><tr><th>Excisable Products</th><th>Product</th><th>Personal Allowance for 3rd country travellers </th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cigarettes</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cigarillos</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cigars</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Tobacco products</td><td>Loose tobacco</td><td>250g</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Spirits</td><td>1 litre</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Intermediate products (e.g. port., sherry) and sparkling wine</td><td>2 litres</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Wine</td><td>4 litres</td></tr><tr><td>Alcohol products</td><td>Beer</td><td>16 litres</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The zero rate for food and drink is provided for under a derogation from EU VAT law which allows Member States to retain certain zero rates for goods and services which were expressly covered in their national VAT legislation on 1 January 1991. The legislative provision for food and drink was in place on 1 January 1991; however, there was no legislative provision for food supplement products and therefore they cannot be legally zero rated.</p><p>Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils and Revenue&rsquo;s guidance simply reflected this. The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplement products was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector and has never been disputed by Revenue. However, the various VAT rating decisions published in its VAT rates database and other information made available in whatever form on food supplement products cannot override VAT law.</p><p>Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its zero rating concession had broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices. There were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand the zero rate to products that should be standard rated, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover and reduce stress.</p><p>Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following this review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Act 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Act 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This will allow time for the consideration of any legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020. </p><p>My Department carried out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. The consultation sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts and the Minister for Health. The results of the consultation were included in the recently published 2019 VAT Tax Strategy Group (&lsquo;TSG&rsquo;) paper as part of the Budget 2020 process. Several options have been set out on the VAT treatment of food supplement products in the TSG paper, available here: <i>.</i></p></reply>

Westmeath), the Office of Public Works (OPW) and Westmeath County Council (WCC) are working together to advance flood relief works for the town with WCC as the Contracting Authority and OPW funding the costs of the works in addition to undertaking the construction works with its own workforce.  Engineering consultants were appointed in April 2017, to identify appropriate flood risk alleviation measures for Athlone.  The Option Appraisal Report identified eight discrete cells of flood defence works. These flood cells are each being progressed individually under Part 8 or Part 10 of the Planning and Development Regulations.  It is anticipated that the construction works for the Athlone Flood Alleviation Scheme will be completed during 2021.  </p>  <p>Consultants have also been commissioned by the OPW and/or the relevant Local Authority to undertake the design, development and planning of Flood Relief Schemes in Springfield (Co. Clare) and Castleconnell (Co. Limerick).  Procurement is scheduled to commence in the coming months to appoint Engineering Consultants for the design, development and planning of Flood Relief Schemes in Limerick City &amp;amp; Environs, Leitrim Village and Carrick-on-Shannon (Co. Leitrim), and Killaloe/Ballina (Co. Clare/Tipperary).  It is intended to progress the development of flood relief schemes in Dromod (Co. Leitrim) and Portumna   (Co. Galway) within the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2018 to 2027.</p>  <p>  The Government also established the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group in 2016 to support existing plans in place to address flooding on the Shannon and to enhance the ongoing co-operation of all State Agencies involved with the River Shannon.  The Group has taken a number of significant decisions since its establishment, including targeted maintenance activities at a number of locations, trialling the lowering of the levels on Lough Allen, studies to explore managing flood risk at the Callows and a study on the cause, degree and rate of restriction downstream of Parteen Weir.  The Group is also considering a feasible long term maintenance programme for the River Shannon.</p></reply>

The Minister will, over the coming months, undertake an environmental assessment of the proposed scheme.  This assessment will be in line with required legislative requirements and will involve a public consultation.   The procurement and appointment of a Contractor will be progressed for this scheme following formal Ministerial Confirmation.  </p>  <p>  The flood relief scheme will be funded from within the allocated &euro;1 billion for flood risk management over the period 2018-2027.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance has overall responsibility for the Government&rsquo;s flood insurance policy. The Office of Public Works (OPW) has an important role to assist insurance companies to take into account the protection provided by flood defence schemes completed by the OPW. </p>  <p>  In this regard, the OPW has a Memorandum of Understanding with Insurance Ireland, the representative body of the insurance industry. This Memorandum sets out principles of how the two organisations work together to ensure that appropriate data on  completed schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding. </p>  <p>  The insurance industry has its own flood modelling tools for assessing the level of risk that it is willing to underwrite in relation to individual properties.  While the Memorandum notes the OPW requirement that, when assessing exposure to flood risk, insurers take full account of information provided by the OPW on completed schemes, it does not guarantee the availability of flood risk cover in the locations for which information has been provided.  The decision on whether to offer insurance, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are commercial decisions for individual insurers based on their assessment of the risks they would be accepting on a case-by-case basis.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-17a.314.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091700072#WRF02700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 152 together.</p>  <p>  I would advise both Deputies that pensions for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality. However, as the matter raised relates to pension policy for the public service generally, I will address the questions raised.  </p>  <p>  Firstly, I should clarify that retirement lump sum payments made under public service pension schemes were not directly reduced by the Financial Emergency Measure in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation. The FEMPI legislation implemented measures that directly reduced the pay of serving staff and introduced a Public Service Pension Reduction for pensions in payment, subject to certain rates, thresholds and exemptions. As both the annual pensions and lump sum payments of members of pre-existing public service pension schemes (i.e. excluding the Single Public Service Pension Scheme) are directly linked to salary at retirement, the reductions to the pay of public servants would have had a knock on impact on the lump sum payment they received at retirement. </p>  <p>  However, because of what is known as the first &lsquo;grace period&rsquo;, those who retired between 1 January 2010 and 29 February 2012 did not have the first FEMPI pay reduction (imposed 1 January 2010) reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their annual pension or their lump sum. A second round of FEMPI reductions was imposed in 2013 (imposed on 1 July on public servants with an annual remuneration above &euro;65,000). The second &lsquo;grace period&rsquo; meant that those who retired from that point onwards (assuming their pay was affected by those reductions while still serving) did not have those reductions reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their annual pension or lump sum. </p>  <p>  In the cases referred to by the Deputies, retirement occurred after 1 March 2012 and so the retirement lump sum was calculated by reference to the salary rates in payment on 1 January 2010 (i.e. following the first FEMPI pay reduction). If the salary at retirement was subject to the second FEMPI reduction on 1 July 2013, the operation of the second grace period would mean that the lump sum would still have been calculated by reference to the 1 January 2010 rate. </p>  <p>  The two grace periods were the only protections given in relation to the calculation and payment of retirement lump sums in the context of the FEMPI legislation, and I have no proposals to make any change in this regard.</p>  <p>  As regards pension increases, the current pension increase policy for pre-existing pension schemes was agreed by the Government as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA). This policy is essentially a time-limited (expires end-2020) resumption of the non-statutory pension increase arrangements, sometimes known as pay parity, which formerly prevailed, but which lapsed in 2010. Under that policy, pay increases applied to serving staff over the course of the PSSA are passed on to those annual pensions where the salary on which the annual pension is based, in any case, does not exceed the salary of a serving staff member with the same grade and scale point, after the pay increase has been applied. If it qualifies, the annual pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff.</p>  <p>  The guidance on operation of the pension increase policy is set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 02/2018, while further instructions have recently been issued in Circular 19/2019. This guidance is directed to all public service employers including the Department of Justice and Equality as administrators of the pension schemes of retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

It is integrated into European Social Fund (ESF) programming as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020 (PEIL).  The specific YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m (for 2014 and 2015)  is matched by equal amounts from our ESF allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m.   Ireland was not eligible for an additional allocation under the second YEI allocation arising from the mid-term revision of the Multi-annual Financial Framework in 2017, which was focussed on those Member States with youth unemployment rates of higher than 25% in 2016.</p>  <p>  All ESF activities, including YEI activities, are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer with the EU (ESF/YEI) funding being claimed in arrears.  </p>  <p>  The first payment application in respect of the PEIL, which included &euro;112.25m in respect of YEI activities, was submitted to the European Commission in November 2018 resulting in receipts of &euro;67.35m in respect of the YEI/ESF contributions towards the YEI activities.  A further payment application was submitted in June 2019 which included &euro;4.75m in respect of YEI activities resulting in receipts of &euro;2.84m.</p>  <p>  Further payment applications are in the course of preparation for submission to the Commission this year and it is expected that they will include some &euro;50m in respect of YEI activities.  If realised this will bring the total YEI expenditure declared in payment applications to some &euro;167m, leaving &euro;37m to be declared in 2020 or subsequently.</p>  <p>  The ESF authorities will ensure that sufficient payment applications are submitted to fully drawdown the YEI/ESF funding allocations.</p></reply>

In order to train as an apprentice a person first needs to be recruited by an approved employer. There is no central record of applications to employers for apprenticeship positions as this is part of wider labour market activity.</p><p>While the Apprenticeship Council has issued two formal calls for proposals to develop new apprenticeships and Government is promoting apprenticeships heavily through the Generation Apprenticeship campaign, decisions to develop new apprenticeships are taken by groups of employers with reference to the various options open to them to develop the skills needed in their sectors.  Employers in Ireland have responded in large numbers to the calls for proposals and apprenticeships are now much more widely available across sectors.For the first time, apprenticeships have become available in recent years in areas such as auctioneering, biopharmachem, insurance, finance, hospitality and food, ICT and logistics, with further programmes in the pipeline in renewable energy, retail, hairdressing and a range of other sectors.  These add to the long-standing base of apprenticeship in areas such as construction, motor and engineering.</p><p>In all 20 new apprenticeship programmes are available and 36 more are in development.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  The school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area.  There are no current plans to revise school planning areas.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including a new post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Blanchardstown_West_Dublin15 and BlanchardstownVge_Dublin15 school planning areas as a regional solution.</p>  <p>  New schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required, in the first instance, to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area where they have sufficient places.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, Old River Road is located in the adjacent Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area. As the Deputy may be aware, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school was established in 2014 to serve the Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 and had just over 600 pupils enrolled in the 2018/19 school year. </p>  <p>  While the recent announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population.</p></reply>

The budget for the Department of Education and Skills has increased by &euro;674 million this year, a 6.7% increase on last year.  In total, the Education budget has increased by &euro;1.7 billion compared to 2016.</p>  <p>  This school year sees the numbers employed in our schools reach the highest ever level.  Over 1,300 additional posts in schools have been funded, including more than 370 posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes.  This builds on the Budget 2018 measure which provided a one point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level.</p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio show an improved ratio of teachers to students from 16:1 to 15.2:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2018/19 school year.  Average class sizes at primary level improved from 24.9 to 24.3 in the same period. </p>  <p>  The Budget 2019 measure which provided for an additional release day for teaching principals in primary schools and a further four additional release days for teaching principals in schools with special classes has been implemented for the current school year.</p>  <p>  &euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions, i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 posts.  The Department has committed to revising the Posts of Responsibility table in the leadership and management circulars to take into account retirements during the school year.  This ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibility are maintained in the school system.</p>  <p>  I fully recognise the need to improve capitation funding for schools.  I am pleased to have been able to provide for a 5% increase in capitation funding for primary and post-primary schools for the current school year.  The first and full year costs of this increase is &euro;4 million and &euro;10 million respectively. </p>  <p>  All proposals made in relation to education expenditure will be considered in the context of Budget 2020, having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands in the education sector.</p></reply>

At the time, priority was given to protecting resources for front-line education services as far as possible.</p>  <p>  The annual cost of fully funding the reconfigured Gaeltacht Placement on primary initial teacher education (ITE) programmes for 1,200 student teachers in the four state-funded providers is estimated at &euro;1.8m per annum. </p>  <p>  While there is no provision currently in my Department's budget for this grant or an element thereof in 2019, because of ongoing budgetary pressures which continue to be acute, the matter remains under consideration in my Department. </p>  <p>  To assist with the costs of the Gaeltacht placement, students who are in receipt of a student grant which includes a 100% fee grant, or who would have qualified for a full fee grant but for the Free Fees Scheme, can apply for funding towards travel and accommodation costs under the field trip element of a fee grant, subject to the normal terms and conditions of the student grant scheme.

The starting salaries for a new entrant special need assistant and school secretaries paid on a public service payscale in 2012 was &euro;20,869. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of these staff is now &euro;23,999 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;24,602.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.  This agreement will benefit both 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. </p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectorial issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants. </p>  <p>  Specifically in respect of school secretaries, I recognise the very important work done by these staff, and the other support staff in the running of our schools.  I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of these surveys.  In these circumstances any industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered premature, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.  My officials are fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once the survey work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, may the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil. </p><p>As the deputy's question refers to a specific child, the question will be forwarded to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Therefore the ETB has control on how much they wish to allocate locally to individual programmes including the adult literacy programme, which is covered under target 3 on social mobility and transversal skills development in the ETB strategic performance agreements.</p>  <p>  The ETBs report to SOLAS three times per year.  In the mid-year and September returns ETBs can request approval to change the structure of their allocation should, for example, the need occur to invest more in a particular programme. Thus flexibility within the structure of their allocation can be accommodated as local priorities emerge during the year.</p></reply>

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of these surveys.  In these circumstances any industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered premature, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.  My officials are fully open to having further dialogue with F&Oacute;RSA once the survey work has been undertaken.</p></reply>

At that time, a part of 1 school building was closed, immediate precautionary measures were put in place in 22 schools, with the remaining 17 schools not requiring immediate precautionary measures pending further detailed investigations.  Detailed investigations in the 22 schools with precautionary measures in place took place between January and May 2019.  The first phase of the School Remediation Programme for these schools took place during the 2019 summer holiday period with permanent remediation work carried out enabling the removal of precautionary measures in full in 14 schools and preparatory work well advanced to commence structural remediation work in the remaining 8 schools.</p>  <p>  Planned detailed investigations in the remaining 17 schools also took place over the Summer months. The engineering advice following those detailed investigations was that some temporary engineering solutions and other precautionary measures should be completed in some parts of some of these buildings until permanent remediation works were designed, programmed and delivered.  These works were completed in advance of these schools re-opening for the new school year.</p>  <p>  The programme to complete the remediation of all the impacted schools is continuing, with the intention to maximise the summer holiday periods in 2020 and 2021 to carry out permanent works. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to liaise with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office on the on-going legal process related to the schools built by the contractor involved.  Proceedings have issued in a number of schools to date.  The next date Court date is expected to be in October 2019.  For legal reasons, my Department is not in a position, at this time, to provide the costs for the remediation work.</p></reply>

It would be rare for a school building project to have a construction period in excess of 31 months; therefore, construction inflation does not generally impact on projects under construction.  Tendering contractors must carry the risk for construction inflation during the construction period and this has the effect of curbing inflation as contractors are incentivised to purchase materials at the best price available. </p></reply>

The issue of promoting healthy eating is addressed in schools through subjects such as Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), and Home Economics as well as in Physical Education.  The aim is to equip students with such skills and knowledge to enable them to make appropriate choices for healthy lifestyles. This informed approach will help to reduce the incidence of obesity in our young people. </p><p>Schools are strongly encouraged to have a formal healthy eating policy that has been developed in consultation with students and parents. </p><p>Guidelines are available to schools on developing a healthy eating policy in Post-Primary Schools, which have been developed by the Department of Health and HSE. The healthy eating policy should outline how the school supports healthy eating practices through the promotion of healthy lunches and healthy snacks and other means. </p><p>My Department has issued circulars to all primary and post primary schools on the Promotion of Healthy Lifestyles. </p><p>In relation to higher education institutions, these are autonomous institutions and the management of their affairs are matters for the individual institutions concerned.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  </p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in an area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain up-to-date data on significant new residential developments in each area. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  For school planning purposes, Hollystown is located in the Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area. A new 1,000 pupil post-primary school (Le Ch&eacute;ile Secondary School) was established in 2014 to serve this school planning area and had just over 600 pupils enrolled in the 2018/19 school year. In addition, two new 16 classroom primary schools were established to serve this school planning area, Powerstown ETNS in 2011 and Gaelscoil an Chuilinn in 2012, both of which have existing capacity. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including a new post-primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the adjacent school planning areas of Blanchardstown_West_Dublin15 and BlanchardstownVge_Dublin15 as a regional solution.</p>  <p>  While the recent announcement did not include a new school for the Mulhuddart_Tyrrelstown_D15 school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

Some schools received slightly reduced allocations, where the data indicates less need, and some schools maintained their existing allocations.</p><p>No school has lost a full special education teaching post as a result of the re profiling process.</p><p>There  has also been be no reduction to the overall number of special education teaching posts within the school system. There are currently over 13,400 special education teachers in schools, an increase of 37% since 2011.</p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. </p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy has 10 special education teaching hours, or 0.4 of a special education teacher post, for an enrolment of 41 pupils at the time the profile was developed. </p><p>Both my Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.</p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published details of an appeal process for the 2019 allocation process for schools on their website <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p><p>Schools were advised that the appeal will consider circumstances where schools considered that their school profile was calculated incorrectly, using the data set out in DES Circulars 007 and 008 2019. An appeal could be submitted for a review of the information used and of the calculation of the allocation. </p><p>The NCSE wrote to schools on 31st May, 2019 to advise them of the outcome of the appeals. </p><p>A second process will be put in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2019/20 school year.</p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts, in accordance with these criteria, will also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>Finally, it is acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process, or allocations for developing school status. </p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.</p><p>A process will also be available where schools can seek a review of their allocations in the coming months, including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>I am satisfied that there are in place a number of processes which can review the special education teacher allocation for schools where necessary.</p><p>The very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years to provide additional Special Education Teachers means that all schools are resourced to provide for the special educational needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with a broad range of problems including behavioural, emotional and social.<i></i></p><p>To support this holistic approach my Department has published a Well-being Policy and Framework for Practice (2018-2023) for all schools which will inform how schools can promote student well-being.To implement the Well-being Policy every school is required by 2023, to use the six-step School Self-Evaluation (SSE) process with the Well-being Framework for Practice, to consider their existing provision for well-being and to devise and implement a plan for improvement. The participating schools will engage in a Well-being Promotion Process, working through the six-steps of School Self Evaluation with sustained in-school support from the Department&rsquo;s support services. </p><p>The Well-being Policy also includes an Implementation Plan with seven high level actions to support the realisation of the policy.My Department is working with a range of education partners and agencies to realise the ambition in the plan.  </p><p>The Well-being Policy also builds<i></i>on the work already taking place in schools including the new Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) which places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being. </p><p>Responsibility for provision of mental health services and counselling for young people lies with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. There are no plans for a national school-based counselling programme.  The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides consultation for school staff who may have concerns about individual pupils or students. NEPS supports schools in putting interventions in place for individuals with clearly identified and serious difficulties.  Consultation in relation to appropriate therapeutic interventions delivered in the school setting is also available.  When counselling is considered to be required a referral is made to an outside agency.  Schools are advised to have identified appropriate referral pathways in consultation with HSE and other mental health services in their local community. </p><p>Schools are advised to identify supports and services that are available in their community, build relationships and agree referral pathways for students needing referral. The (NEPS) in my Department provides psychological support and engages in collaborative work helping school staff including the school&rsquo;s Guidance Counselling Service in how to access appropriate mental health services. Psychologists support schools in connecting with Primary Care Psychology Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health services in relation to individual children and young people with mental health needs. Psychologists support and encourage the establishment of referral and communication protocols between education and health services at local level and work with others to develop community based mental health promotion strategies.  In addition NEPS psychologists provide support to schools in implementing Student Support Teams in Post Primary Schools. </p><p>NEPS also provides guidelines and resource materials for schools to enable them to deal with certain traumatic events which can adversely affect students and school staff. The guidelines <i>responding to Critical Incidents: Guidelines and Resource Materials for Schools</i>(2016) refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment. It also outlines how schools can plan for crises.  The publication provides support to schools at a potentially overwhelming time with practical step-by-step guidance for teachers and principals on how to respond when a tragedy occurs. The guidelines focus on alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incidents such as suicide or suspected suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of members of the school community. In relation to suicide, advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches.

Following his engagement with the family, I received a proposal from Judge Haughton for some changes to the terms of reference for the scoping exercise.  </p><p>This necessitated further consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.

Rollout of this model meets a key commitment in <i>A Policing Service for the Future</i>, the four year implementation plan giving effect to the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. </p><p>While new to Ireland, this model is the norm in other countries.  It is designed to reduce bureaucracy and will shift real decision-making power from Garda Headquarters to the Chief Superintendents, closer to the communities they serve.  Importantly, it will also result in significantly more Sergeants and Inspectors on the ground where leadership, supervision and mentoring is crucial.</p><p>I understand that the finer details of the implementation of the new Divisional structures are currently being determined by the Garda Commissioner and his team, and that the new model will be implemented on a phased basis throughout 2020.</p><p>Regarding the approach which will be taken to the merger of Divisions - the Deputy will appreciate that the Commissioner is by law responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including the deployment and distribution of Garda personnel. Accordingly the detail of the implementation of the new Divisional structure is solely for the Commissioner and not for me as Minister.</p><p>I understand however that the Commissioner and his team is meeting Joint Policing Committees all over Ireland in the weeks ahead and there will be opportunities for detailed local engagement at that stage.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that these changes are being introduced at a time of record investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. &euro;1.76 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2019, as well as capital investment amounting to &euro;92 million this year. In terms of Garda numbers the Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to achieving a Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021.</p><p>I am confident that this ongoing investment in Garda resources together with the ongoing reform process will result in an improved policing service for all communities.</p></reply>

If the Agreement is not ratified, this is referred to as the &quot;no deal&quot; scenario.  A &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; scenario will mean that a non-EEA person who is legally resident in Ireland, on the basis of their familial relationship to a British citizen, will no longer be covered by the provisions of the EU Free Movement Directive and the exercise of EU Treaty rights and entitlements. </p><p>The Immigration Service is putting in place transitional arrangements for people in this group who have been registered in Ireland before 31 October 2019.  Under these arrangements, a person may change to a new permission based on domestic immigration arrangements. This will provide for their continued residence and access to the labour market in the State.</p><p>The issued letters request those potentially affected by a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; scenario to confirm their current address, and to advise the Immigration Service of any change in their personal circumstances, by Monday 30 September 2019. As an individual&rsquo;s circumstances may have changed since they were initially granted their residence card, up to date information is being sought from them to enable the Immigration Service to triage these permission holders to identify the most suitable and beneficial immigration arrangements that could apply to them in a no-deal Brexit scenario.</p><p>I am further advised that non-EU/non-EEA family members of British citizens who currently have a residence card/permanent residence card application under consideration do not need to take any specific action at this time.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that national security is outside the competence of the EU, so ongoing day-to-day cooperation in this area with the UK will continue following Brexit, whatever form it ultimately takes. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, considerable planning and preparation across the criminal justice area has been ongoing to take account of the potential impact of Brexit, including in relation to ensuring the continuance of effective extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK. This is necessary because of Britain&rsquo;s proposed departure from the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) system. While the EAW will cease to apply when Brexit occurs, the High Court in the meantime is continuing to deal with outstanding UK EAW cases. </p>  <p>  Following examination of the options available for extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the fall-back solution is to apply the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition, to which both Ireland and the UK are party, to extradition arrangements between Ireland and the UK. </p>  <p>  The provisions of the Convention are given effect to by Part II of the Extradition Act 1965. The 1965 Act has been amended by Part 13 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2019, which can be commenced when Brexit occurs, in order to ensure that this is a workable solution.</p></reply>

At that time, I updated the House on the significant progress made in the ratification process within the term of this Government, particularly through the introduction of legislation to give effect to the key criminal law provisions of the Convention.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the Cybercrime Convention, otherwise known as the Budapest Convention, the majority of the provisions of the Convention are already provided for in Irish law. The Cybercrime Convention is very broad in scope and provisions of the Convention are provided for in criminal justice, interception, sexual offences, extradition, mutual legal assistance and copyright legislation.</p>  <p>  The most significant step towards ratification of the Budapest Convention was the enactment in 2017 of the first Bill in this jurisdiction specifically targeted at cybercrime.  The Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Act 2017 gave effect to an EU Directive on attacks against information systems, the main provisions of which reflect the key provisions of the Convention. </p>  <p>  This recent legislation therefore also gives effect to provisions in the Convention relating to offences against information systems and their data and search and seizure powers in respect of such data.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the organisation with primary responsibility for dealing with cybercrime, has strongly welcomed this landmark legislation as a comprehensive weapon to tackle criminality including computer systems and interference with such systems or their data. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Cybercrime Convention Committee in Strasbourg earlier this year and discussed with the Council of Europe Ireland's positive progress on ratification. </p>  <p>  The current Government Legislation Programme makes provision for the drafting of a new Cybercrime Bill to give effect to those remaining elements of the Convention not already covered in national law.  This is to ensure that Ireland can ratify the Budapest Convention and is evidence of the Government's clear commitment in that regard. My intention is that this legislation will be in place to facilitate formal ratification of the Convention as soon as it is possible. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-17a.741.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091700078#WRM02500"><p>The Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (&ldquo;the Convention&rdquo;) is one of sustained and on-going improvement. Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the Convention's requirements.</p>  <p>  The National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) 2017 &ndash; 2021 contains a wide range of practical commitments to improve the position of people with disabilities in Ireland. It provides a mechanism for joined-up working to deliver on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to implementing the UNCRPD. The NDIS Steering Group, which oversees and monitors the implementation of the Strategy, has an important role in guiding progress in this area. The Group is committed to carrying out a mid-term review of the Strategy by the end of this year. It is expected that the review will examine how the Strategy is aligned with the articles of the Convention and how the Strategy could be revised and built upon in order to continue progressive realisation of the aims of the Convention. The National Disability Authority (NDA) also plays a critical role in the implementation of the Convention, and will be carrying out a review of progress with respect to the Strategy&rsquo;s key indicators in this regard. </p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to Article 12 of the Convention is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties. The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The 2015 Act will abolish the current Wards of Court system by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871. Part 6 of the 2015 Act provides that adults currently in wardship will transition to the new decision-making support arrangements provided for in the Act on a phased basis over 3 years from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act.</p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health), must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the 2015 Act can be commenced. The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.  This lead-in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. The 2019 Revised Estimates Volume provides for an allocation of &euro;3.5 million in the Justice and Equality Vote for the establishment of the Decision Support Service. </p>  <p>  The Government continues to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.  The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published in April 2017 and many of its recommendations have been implemented. In addition, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024 includes positive action measures to support the recruitment of people with disabilities in the public service and in the wider economy.</p>  <p>  In addition to the practical measures outlined, the Deputy will be aware of a number of legislative developments to support the implementation of the Convention.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, my colleague the Minister for Health is progressing Heads of a Bill to provide legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty. A report of a recent public consultation on these draft legislative provisions is nearing completion, and every effort is being made to progress this legislation as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which contains key legislative amendments needed for compliance with the Convention, was published in December 2016. The Bill includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention. It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process.</p>  <p>  The monitoring framework will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the National Disability Authority (NDA) and will be governed by a formal Memorandum of Understanding. In January of this year, the IHREC established a Disability Advisory Committee, composed of a diverse group of persons with lived experience of disability. This will ensure the direct participation of persons with disabilities and the organisations representing them in monitoring how the Convention is implemented in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The IHREC is best placed to make periodic independent reports to the UN, supported by progress assessments and statistical information supplied by the NDA.  The NDA has expertise and information resources in relation to reporting on disability issues and is carrying out work in a range of areas to support implementation; including the preparation of non-healthcare Codes of Practice under the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and review of progress with respect to the key indicators of the NDIS.</p>  <p>  Significant year-on-year budgetary increases in the disability sector have positively impacted the lived experience of people with disabilities in Ireland. However, I recognise that daily challenges remain for many people with disabilities and for their families.   Addressing the needs and rights of people living with a disability and their families is a priority for this Government and my primary focus as Minister of State for Disability Issues. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities supports that priority in providing a comprehensive and robust framework for the realisation of those rights.</p></reply>

The General Scheme was approved by Government<b></b>in June 2018 and it is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>The Bill is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. My officials and that Office are working together to bring the Bill to a final draft for publication as soon as possible. </p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the purpose of the Bill is to enhance current systems for assessment and management of convicted sex offenders and to put those systems on a statutory footing.  While the drafting process is not yet complete, the main provisions are expected to include:</p><p>- Stricter notification requirements including requiring offenders to notify Garda&iacute; of their address upon release from custody, or any subsequent change of address, within 3 days as opposed to the existing 7 days.</p><p>- Provisions to allow for fingerprinting and photographing the offender, where necessary to confirm their identity.</p><p>- Enhanced supervision of high-risk offenders, including, in limited circumstances, the electronic monitoring of offenders subject to post-release supervision orders.</p><p>- The placing on a legislative footing of assessment teams to assess and manage the risk posed by sex offenders.</p><p>- Provisions whereby a court can prohibit a sex offender from working with children.</p><p>- Provision for a statutory basis for the necessary disclosure of information relating to a high-risk offender on the &lsquo;sex offenders register&rsquo;. The information in relation to an offender which may be disclosed include the name, address and threat posed by the offender. It is intended that the disclosure would only be made to the minimum number of people necessary to avert a serious risk to safety.</p><p>I would also point out that there are already important provisions in existing law which can be used in the management of sex offenders after they have been released. </p><p>The Sex Offenders Act 2001 already provides that a Court can impose conditions on a convicted sex offender as part of their post-release supervision. Further, where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believe that a convicted offender poses a serious risk to the public, it can also apply to the courts for a Sex Offender Order under s.16 of the 2001 Act.  A Sex Offender Order can prohibit the offender from doing anything that the Court considers necessary in order to ensure that the public is protected from serious harm.</p></reply>

The recruitment and assimilation of a large number of new professional staff into a multi-disciplinary organisation that undertakes complex work in a fast-moving environment is a project that requires careful management. As such, the Director is of the view that it is preferable to allow that process to fully bed down before filling the Corporate Compliance manager vacancy. My Department continues to be in close engagement with the Public Appointments Service with regard to the filling of the two Forensic Accountant posts recently vacated.  The Director is further conscious of the fact that the transition of the ODCE to an independent Agency will give rise to additional expertise requirements and, as such, is of the view that it is prudent that those considerations should be factored into developing the roles required for the new Agency , and the associated skill set, required of the appointees.</p></reply>

This marks the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date and is four times the size of the trade agreement with Japan.</p>  <p>  Irish exporters have been subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions when exporting to Mercosur. This Agreement will see a significant reduction, or elimination, of tariffs and barriers to trade which will allow an increased flow of trade and investment between Ireland, the EU and the Mercosur region. The EU-Mercosur Agreement should make exports from Ireland more attractive, and potentially increase the demand for Irish products and the employment that supports.</p>  <p>  The Agreement with Mercosur presents sectorial opportunities for Ireland in areas such as software and services in telecoms, financial services, digital content and travel, engineering products and services, life sciences, food and beverages, and education services.</p>  <p>  The EU-Mercosur Association Agreement includes a detailed chapter on Sustainable Development goals and recognises the need to address the urgent threat of climate change and the role trade has in support our climate and environmental goals, as well as underscoring the importance of both Parties implementing provisions of the Paris Climate Agreement.  The Agreement reinforces commitments made by Mercosur countries in relation to the Paris Climate Agreement and provides the EU with clear monitoring and oversight of those commitments, providing leverage to ensure that the environmental protections that Mercosur countries are committed to are fully realized through this trade agreement.</p>  <p>  Following widespread fires in the Amazon rainforest in August, An Taoiseach made clear the Government's concern over the levels of destruction of the Amazonian rainforest. In that regard, I agree that we must closely monitor Brazil&rsquo;s environmental actions in the coming years, in the context of their commitments in the EU-Mercosur Agreement, and before that Agreement comes before the European Council for a vote.</p>  <p>  For our part, following the conclusion of negotiations for the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement, the Government committed to undertake full economic and environmental sustainability assessments of the political agreement. My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is actively pursuing the commissioning of these studies.</p>  <p>  These assessments will consider the impact the Agreement will have on the Irish economy and on jobs, as well as the environmental implications of the deal. These assessments will help to inform our future position in relation to the EU-Mercosur Agreement.</p></reply>

I have been informed by the IDA that they are not currently in talks with any third parties about the sites. While these properties in Fermoy are suitable for investment, information on any visits to them by IDA clients is not available as the Agency only collates site visit data on a county-by-county basis. </p>  <p>  As for Carrigtwohill, the IDA owns approximately 65.5 hectares of marketable land in that area, comprised of 12.5 hectares on the Carrigtwohill B&amp;T Park and 53 hectares in the Ballyadam area. In Mallow, there are 0.68 hectares of marketable land at the Agency&rsquo;s B&amp;T Park there. While information on site visits to these specific locations is not available, the Agency is actively marketing the properties in Carrigtwohill and Mallow to potential investors.  </p>  <p>  As I have indicated previously, the availability of marketable lands, such as these, in advance of demand continues to be a crucial ingredient in the IDA&rsquo;s capacity to compete for mobile foreign direct investment (FDI). Not only does such a supply of properties help the Agency to secure high quality jobs but it also allows projects to begin at an earlier date by diminishing difficulties associated with land acquisition, planning and construction. It therefore remains an important means by which the IDA can encourage and attract new investors to Ireland, particularly to regional locations.</p>  <p>  County Cork continues to be a strong performer in terms of FDI. This trend is continuing, with a steady and positive increase in employment numbers in IDA Ireland client companies in the County over the past number of years. There are currently 169 IDA client companies in Cork, employing approximately 39,000 people.  There have also been a number of recent significant recent job announcements by IDA clients including 400 jobs at VoxPro, 200 positions at Deutsche Borse Group and 100 new jobs at Forcepoint.  </p>  <p>  It is clear, not least from the County's recent performance over the last number of years, that Cork has a robust enterprise base and remains a highly attractive destination for overseas companies. Work will nevertheless continue, by both the enterprise agencies and the Government, to boost further investment and job creation in County Cork and the broader South-West region.</p></reply>

Whilst these increases are not all due to Brexit, they are mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by Brexit.</p><p>While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the delays to Brexit may have led businesses to defer their immediate planning. However, the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will mean changes for Irish businesses. With less than seven weeks to go to Brexit, I urge businesses to accelerate their preparations and avail of the wide range of State supports on offer. In particular, I would appeal to businesses that have not started these preparations to engage with my Department and its agencies as soon as possible.  By taking the necessary practical steps, businesses will be better placed to address the challenges they may face and in doing so, they can help future proof their businesses and continue to trade with the UK and other EU Member States.  I will take this opportunity to outline in more detail the various supports that are available to businesses. </p><p><b>The Local Enterprise Offices</b></p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs] are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. </p><p>In addition, 702 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. 691 LEO clients have been approved for the Technical Assistance Grant. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Office interactive one day Prepare Your Business for Customs workshop helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to succeed in a post Brexit environment. 613 Participants have so far attended this Customs Training.</p><p><b>InterTrade Ireland</b></p><p>InterTrade Ireland [ITI] also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. So far this year, more than 3,300 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.  </p><p>ITI offers a Brexit Start to Plan voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. </p><p>ITI Brexit Start to Plan vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. 1,770 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which over 1,500 have been approved. ITI&rsquo;s Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This will allow businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.</p><p>In August, ITI launched a new advertising campaign and a new online resource to encourage and assist firms in preparing for Brexit. The online &ldquo;Bitesize Brexit&rdquo; resource is a one-stop-shop for cross-border traders, presenting information in easily digestible segments and includes specific actions businesses should take in preparing for Brexit.</p><p><b>Brexit Loan Schemes</b></p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, launched in March of 2018, provides relatively short-term working capital, 1 to 3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them to innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland [SBCI] and, if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.  </p><p>As at 6 September, there have been 778 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 704 have been approved to date by SBCI. 185 of those applications have progressed to sanction at bank value, to a total value of &euro;41.062 million.</p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme makes up to &euro;300 million of loans available with a term of 8-10 years. This scheme is available to eligible businesses in Ireland and the primary agriculture (farmers) and seafood sectors to support strategic long-term investment. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the scheme operator, opened for eligibility applications on 17th April and up to 30 August it received 1,112 eligibility applications and issued 1,061 eligibility letters.</p><p><b>Enterprise Ireland</b></p><p>Enterprise Ireland [EI] has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p><p>Over 6,100 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms have a plan in place, while 211 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 272 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 16 Brexit Advisory Clinics around the country. </p><p>EI also launched a Customs Insights Online course at the beginning of the year. This is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. There have been over 1,500 Customs Insights Course participants.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland also recently revealed 12 &lsquo;Brexit Essential&rsquo; questions aimed at helping exporting businesses further prepare and take action ahead of the UK&rsquo;s impending withdrawal from the EU.  The Brexit Essentials campaign highlights the key questions and documentation that businesses need to address in order to trade successfully with the UK post 31 October.</p><p>The Irish Government, in association with key industry partners, also launched a new support measure to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses develop the capacity to deal with the additional customs requirements due to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. The new initiative called Clear Customs comprises of a training programme and a customs financial support to assist with the costs of recruiting and assigning new staff to customs roles.</p><p>Supports and advice are also available from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, IDA Ireland, Revenue, Skillnet Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Bord Bia and Failte Ireland. </p><p> </p></reply>

As a result of this extension, the eligibility of individual applicants may have expired requiring a reapplication for the Scheme.  I am encouraged that firms are reapplying so as to ensure that they have the necessary safety nets in place for whatever form Brexit takes. </p>  <p>  In addition, some businesses did not proceed with their original application after they had received their eligibility code and some businesses applied for more than one loan under different eligibility codes. A number of businesses supplied incorrect information in their first applications and updated this information in their reapplications for eligibility.</p>  <p>  Despite the continuing uncertainty around the nature of the UK's departure from the EU, I strongly urge businesses to continue to plan for Brexit, and to start planning without delay if they have not done so already.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-09-17a.794.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019091700079#WRN01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322, 336, 340, 353 and 359 together.</p>  <p>The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department.  NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease.  Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009 the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12-13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  In September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme and is provided free of charge to girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  During the 2019/20 school year, girls attending secondary school can still join the HPV girls only programme with appointments offered in HSE mop up clinics.  It must be noted that vaccinated women and girls may still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p>  <p>  As you are aware, NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys.  On foot of NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme, which offers HPV vaccination to all girls in their first year of second level education (generally 12 to 13 year olds), to a programme that also offers the vaccination to boys in their first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys.  A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys starting in September 2019 with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for several reasons:</p>  <p>  - Vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;</p>  <p>  - Boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases.  As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.  Therefore, the gender neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage.  All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  Extending the HPV vaccine to boys will also provide direct protection to boys against HPV-related disease.  It also provides indirect herd protection to girls who have not been vaccinated.  Another important factor includes the additional protection provided by a gender neutral programme to vulnerable groups (for example, men who have sex with men) and the potential to improve the resilience of the immunisation programme to fluctuations in vaccine uptake and to the movement of individuals into and out of the country.</p>  <p>  For older children who did not receive the vaccine as part of the School Immunisation Programme the HPV vaccine can only be obtained privately from a GP.  If your child is 15 years of age or older they will require three doses of the HPV vaccine in order to be fully protected.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered free of charge by their GP.  However, the cost of purchasing the vaccine privately is not covered by the medical card.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p></reply>

The Committee makes 11 main recommendations, which include proposals both related to broad policy objectives and more technical amendments.  Given the comprehensive scope of the legislation and the ethical, legal and social issues which arise from AHR practices, it is anticipated that certain areas of the General Scheme will require further consideration and refinement during the ongoing process of drafting the bill.  The Joint Committee&rsquo;s Report and its recommendations will be considered as part of this process.</p>  <p>  Interlinked with the legislation, officials in my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, are developing a model of care for infertility and an associated public fund for AHR.  This work includes developing proposals on the allocation of the &euro;1 million fund for use in relation to AHR which was announced in December 2018.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, options in relation to the parameters of any potential public funding model, including what eligibility criteria may be included, are still under consideration, and an announcement will be forthcoming once the relevant decisions have been finalised.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish Public Health Service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.  I understand that the impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of these schemes is not insignificant.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.  </p>  <p>  Overall, the development of a model of care for infertility will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible services through the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2019, the NHSS is expected to support 23,042 people in 2019. The NHSS budget for 2019 is &euro;985.8m which is an increase of &euro;24.3m over its 2018 budget.</p>  <p>  The HSE has noted that the number of residents in nursing homes whom are supported by the NHSS is ahead of forecast for the year to date. The latest available performance reports indicate that there are 23,236 people supported in the Scheme at the end of July this year. This is significantly more people than forecast and this creates a challenge. The HSE has also advised that the cost of care continues to rise and the average weekly cost per bed is higher in 2019 than anticipated.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the available budget and the demand for support, the HSE releases funding in a managed way to ensure that the operation of the NHSS remains within the budgetary allocation. To manage the available funds throughout the year, a national placement list for the release of funding is operated by the HSE, to enable it to operate within budget. Funding issues to applicants in chronological order, to ensure equity nationally. Approved applicants are placed on the national placement list in order of their approval date and funding is released to applicants in order of their place on this list. The length of time spent on the placement list depends on the number of applicants currently receiving financial support and the number of new applications. Where demand is higher, the time spent on the waiting list may increase having regard for the prudent management of the Scheme's budget.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are working to ensure that the resources that are available are deployed in the most effective way possible and deliver the best outcomes for older people, and are also engaging extensively with the HSE in the context of planning for winter, including consideration of the response to dealing with the current challenges such as the high-level of delayed transfers of care. While this engagement continues the HSE has been authorised to undertake immediate action to mitigate the challenges. Engagement will continue over the coming weeks having regard to the Estimates 2020 process.</p>  <p>  Delayed Transfers of Care continue to represent a significant challenge to the Health Service as a whole, and for some hospital patients their ultimate destination will be into transitional care or long term residential care supported by the NHSS. However, there are a number of challenges apart from those related to the NHSS, that lead to delayed transfers of care. The Delayed Discharges Implementation Group has been established to address these challenges through the implementation of the recommendations emanating from the Report of the Independent Expert Review of Delayed Discharges.</p></reply>

In 2019, the Health Service Executive allocated funding of &euro;1.9 billion to its Disability Services Programme. This has supported the delivery of targeted improvements in a number of priority areas. For example, an additional &euro;12 million was allocated this year for the provision of services for 1,500 young people leaving school and rehabilitative training in 2019 and funding has been provided for 100 additional therapy posts in 2019 in children&rsquo;s disability services.  Dedicated capital funding of &euro;100m for disability services over the period 2016&ndash;2021, together with the establishment of a Service Reform Fund, will support the phased transition to person-centred models of services and supports.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Health, and I brought a Memorandum to Government on proposals for a new Transport Support Payment Scheme.  Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at that time.  We intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris, on the best way to progress the Transport Support Payment Scheme. </p>  <p>  The level of funding available for Departments next year is being considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process for 2020 which is currently underway. Pending completion of this process it is not appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p><p>With regard to whether the patient can avail of treatment through the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF). The NTPF works with public hospitals, as opposed to with patients directly, to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. </p><p>The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first. While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List. The clinical suitability of the patient to avail of NTPF funded treatment is determined by the public hospital.</p><p>In addition, the HSE operates the Cross-Border Directive (CBD) in Ireland which entitles persons ordinarily resident in Ireland who have an appropriate referral for public healthcare to opt to avail of that healthcare in another EU/EEA Member State. The CBD provides rules for the reimbursement to patients of the cost of receiving treatment abroad, where the patient would be entitled to such treatment in their home Member State, and supplements the rights that patients already have at EU level. </p><p>Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other clinicians. In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE through the National Contact Point (NCP) provides information for patients on the CBD on its website which can be accessed at  and also by phone at 056 7784551</p><p>Prior authorisation may be required from the HSE for certain healthcare so patients intending to access care under the CBD should check with the HSE in advance of travelling. The HSE advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorisation before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP. </p><p>In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

It is crucial that young people are equipped to make informed choices about substance use. </p>  <p>  There is limited evidence that mass media campaigns are effective at reducing the use of drugs and alcohol. Therefore, the HSE favours more targeted awareness campaigns. For example, it recently launched a resource for parents with practical advice called 'Alcohol and Drugs: A Parents Guide'. The HSE, in partnership with the Union of Students in Ireland have also launched a harm-reduction information campaign, called #SaferStudentNights. The HSE is also currently running a number of initiatives to counteract ecstasy and other drug taking, including a harm reduction campaign through drugs.ie aimed at university students and festival goers. </p>  <p>  Together with the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice, I recently announced a health diversion programme for people in possession of drugs for personal use. </p>  <p>  In progressing this work, we continue to communicate the important message that drug use is not acceptable and can seriously damage our health. The Department of Health will therefore launch a targeted awareness campaign about the dangers of drug use next year, aimed at high risk groups, such as festival goers and students.</p></reply>

They include measures to prevent early use of alcohol and drugs among young people and to minimise harm, where drug use has started. Drug and alcohol task forces have made a significant contribution through local awareness initiatives and evidence-based approaches.  </p>  <p>  Action 2 of the strategy seeks to improve the delivery of substance use education across all services. It will be delivered by developing a guidance document to ensure substance use education and prevention is delivered in accordance with quality standards. The Health Research Board (HRB) is the lead organisation on this action. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, the HRB organised a forum with drug and alcohol task forces to bring professionals together to hear  about best practice in drug education and prevention and to look at ways to advance the sector in Ireland. It included inputs from the European drugs agency on drug prevention best practice, and prevention programmes in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the west of Ireland. </p>  <p>  HRB funding in 2018 and 2019 has been prioritised to carry out the drug prevalence general population survey. Once the survey has been completed, the HRB will be in a position to allocate resources to further progress this action. </p>  <p>  I am committed to developing a health promotion approach to addressing substance misuse in conjunction with Healthy Ireland, the Dept of Education. and other relevant actors.</p></reply>

Animals travelling by road from Ireland can only enter Turkey at Kapikule, on the Bulgaria-Turkey border.  It is the busiest border crossing in Europe and animals regularly encounter very long and unpredictable delays there. There are no facilities to offload animals to provide them with statutory rest periods, food and water; there is only a single water point at that crossing. There is no shelter available. Animals have to remain on the trucks during such delays, where they are often exposed to intolerable conditions including extreme heat or cold.  </p>  <p>  My Department does not intend to reverse this decision.</p></reply>

A Brexit Information Seminar was held on the 10th September in Dublin, and a further two are to be held on the 27th September in Wexford and the 30th September in Cork.  </p>  <p>  The key issues in a no-deal situation which I have stressed in all discussions are the potential loss of access for Irish and other EU vessels to the UK fishing zone, the need to ensure ongoing protection of fish stocks in the waters around Ireland from a subsequent increase in fishing activity and potential supports for the seafood sector to meet the challenges they may face.  It is also important to be aware that, in a no-deal situation, the EU and Ireland could also face a loss of quota share.   </p>  <p>  Throughout the discussions, I emphasised the necessity for a co-ordinated European response to ensure that there would be proportionate and equitable use of mitigation measures for the fishing fleet overseen by the Commission.</p>  <p>  The outcome of these discussions can be seen in the EU Brexit Contingency plan that was published on the 10th April.  This highlights fisheries as one of the most immediately critical issues facing the EU in a no-deal Brexit.  We now have identified and agreed co-ordinated and fully prepared measures that will be immediately available to address a no-deal Brexit situation on 31st October, if the UK were to decide to deny EU vessels access to UK waters.  As I have stated previously, I am seeking additional EU funds to support these mitigation measures if they become necessary.  Such financial discussions are still ongoing and I can assure the Deputy that the seafood sector will be a key priority for the Government in these discussions.   </p></reply>

This reflects our three-pillar policy approach to achieving carbon neutrality without comprising sustainable food production. </p><p>My Department acknowledges that the target set for the sector to reduce emissions from 20.2 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq to less than 19 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq by 2030 is extremely ambitious and not without its challenges but the Teagasc MACC illustrates a suite of actions that provide opportunity for emissions reductions.  These include both efficiency measures such as the Dairy EBI programme and technical measures such as changes in fertiliser type or low emissions slurry spreading as well as a series of forestry and bioeceonomy measures.</p><p>To reach the target of 19 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>eq in 2030 will require us to manage the emissions profile from the sector between now and then through mobilisation of as many of these actions as possible as early as possible with high rates of adoption across our 139,000 farms.</p><p>The Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC) report further highlights the importance of early adoption by farmers of the measures outlined in the Climate Action Plan and illustrates the exposure that livestock numbers are open to if implementation of the Teagasc MACC is not achieved at a sufficient pace. Any hesitancy in take up of these actions will jeopardise our delivery on our committed targets and effectively bring the size of the national herd into focus. However, mechanisms such as the CAP reform, market incentives and regulation are all been investigated in full by all the relevant stakeholders, including industry, to mobilise the necessary actions as swiftly as possible. </p><p>The next Common Agriculture Policy will be fully aligned with this need to prioritise climate action. There will be a step up in environmental and climate delivery in the next CAP.The development of our CAP strategic plan will ensure the delivery of this target. A consultation process on the next CAP has already started and negotiations on CAP policy will intensify over the coming months. </p><p>We are also committed to developing opportunities for agriculture to provide bio-materials to replace high carbon products such as bioplastics, biopharma, biomass etc. In the future, farmers and fishermen will not only be suppliers of food but will also directly or indirectly through co-products or waste streams supply the building blocks for the bioeconomy.</p><p>Through a combination of these measures the agri-food sector will contribute significantly to the national ambition.</p><p>Ireland has an opportunity to become a global leader in actions on climate change. If we succeed in our ambition in this area, we will create a progressive and sustainable society that is not only economically successful but also offers an enhanced quality of lifestyle to society as a whole. </p></reply>

Ireland has a comparative advantage in grass-based carbon efficient livestock production. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission JRC report (2010) found that Ireland is the most carbon efficient producer in the EU per unit of dairy production, and the 5th most carbon efficient producer of beef per kg. Notwithstanding this, inherent challenges remain for the sector in terms of contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s climate change and renewable energy targets. Throughout Europe, reducing greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture has proven difficult, with only a 1% reduction across the EU since 2005. While Irish agriculture emissions fell during the period 2005 to 2011, they have since risen, driven by larger herds and rising milk production reflecting the removal of milk quotas in 2015. However, while agriculture is contributing to emissions, it should also be seen part of the solution. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s policy position for the agriculture sector is an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. There are three strands to my Department&rsquo;s approach to carbon neutrality:</p>  <p>  1. reducing agricultural emissions;</p>  <p>  2. increasing carbon sequestration; and</p>  <p>  3. displacing and substituting fossil fuel and energy intensive materials.</p>  <p>  The All-of-Government Climate Action Plan to Tackle Climate Disruption sets a series of step-up measures and underpinning actions and proposed targets for all sectors including the agriculture, forestry and land use sector. To achieve these challenging targets, it will require immediate action through early adoption and high levels of take-up of the identified actions across our 139,000 plus family farms. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Ireland is a world leader in areas such as sustainable auditing and carbon foot-printing under the Origin Green programme. In total, Bord Bia has cumulatively undertaken over 200,000 carbon footprint assessments on a national scale to date, a world first. The Teagasc Sustainability Survey shows that the top performing third of farms emitted, on average, 9.6 kg CO2 equivalent per kg beef, compared with 14.9 kg for the bottom performing third of cattle farms. Reducing this variability is a real opportunity to make progress in reducing emissions from cattle production in Ireland. Therefore, the well-established and proven QA framework encompassing 33,000 farm visits per year offers huge potential to scale efforts to meet our climate challenges at farm level in particular with the implementation of the MACC measures. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the agriculture sector as a whole will contribute significantly to Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation.</p></reply>

GLAS promotes practices to assist the preservation of habitats and species as well as addressing the issues of climate change mitigation and water quality, in support of sustainable Irish agriculture. </p>  <p>  Since the launch of GLAS tranche 1 in 2015, the Scheme has been extremely successful in terms of uptake with in excess of 50,000 farmers approved into the GLAS scheme over the first three tranches. The Rural Development Programme participation target of 50,000 was exceeded almost two years ahead of schedule.  </p>  <p>  GLAS is a voluntary Scheme where participants opt to carry out specific environmental commitments for a minimum period of five years. A wide range of actions were available under the scheme, including actions to address climate change and reduce emissions, providing the scope for farmers across all types of farming systems to submit applications and maximise their payment under the scheme. Among the achievements under GLAS are 7,500 hectares of minimum tillage, the planting of 1.6m trees and the planting of 11,000 new hedgerows. It is important to remember, however, that GLAS is not just a climate scheme but has other environmental benefits also in areas such as biodiversity and water quality. </p>  <p>  The 2017 Rural Development Programme Evaluation Report  found from a baseline counterfactual analysis using Teagasc National Farm Survey data, that GLAS beneficiaries had a lower than average nitrogen surplus and lower level of greenhouse gas emissions than farms outside of the scheme. The high levels of participation have delivered significant benefits that continue to be delivered by GLAS participant farmers.</p>  <p>  Improving the environmental status of dairy farms is not just a matter for the GLAS scheme, of course, and there are a range of policies which are playing a role here. For example, dairy farmers as higher users of chemical fertiliser will be influenced by wider policies including new measures proposed for farmers availing of the Nitrates Derogation that are aimed at further strengthening the protection of water and attaining optimum soil fertility consistent with both carbon efficient agricultural production and effective water quality protection.  Furthermore, sustainability auditing such as the dairy quality assurance scheme which encompasses almost all dairy farms provides an opportunity to leverage greater action from these farms through market encouragement for evidence of better practice. It is important to consider the full range of levers as well as GLAS that are available to encourage better practice.</p></reply>

The Plan recognises that afforestation has a significant role to play in mitigation, particularly through carbon sequestration  and sets a  target of 8,000 hectares per annum of new planting. Achieving this target will be challenging, as recent trends have not delivered planting at this rate.  It is the case that farm forestry is key to increasing our planting rates, and it is of note that the majority of planting in recent years has been on farms, where forestry complements the farming enterprise and provides the farmer with an additional income source and a long-term asset.</p>  <p>  Successive national programmes have supported afforestation and I will continue to support farmers to plant trees through the provision of generous grants and 15 year premiums under the current Forestry Programme 2014 -2020.  These grants and premiums were significantly increased in 2018, with a view to encouraging greater uptake, and this has had some impact, particularly in terms of broadleaf planting.  </p>  <p>  A greater awareness of the multi-functional benefits of forestry will make afforestation a more attractive proposition for all land-owners, including farmers. That is why I have funded 15 promotional projects, at a cost of nearly &euro;1million to raise awareness of the environmental, recreational and social benefits of forestry. These projects, which run to end 2020, have a regional spread and cover a range of activities from educational to community-based initiatives to forest management and open days on woodland establishment.  This is in addition to the Teagasc Forestry Promotion Campaign 2018 &ndash; 2020 which has an important focus on educating the next generation of young farmers in forestry as they pass through the Teagasc third level college system. The campaign also includes promotion activities at farming events across the country such as the Dairy Open Day and Crops and Cultivation Open Day targeting farmers who may not have considered forestry as an option. </p>  <p>  Current farm forestry owners can encourage others to plant or even increase the level of planting on their own farms. These forest-owners are receiving assistance in understanding and managing their forest asset through Knowledge Transfer groups, where peer-to-peer learning and trained advisors disseminate information over a series of meetings.   My Department funds these groups with 37 new groups approved this year.  The message that needs to be more widely understood is that a valuable income can be secured from a forestry crop and this may go some way towards addressing the reluctance  to plant.</p>  <p>  We will of course also be examining ways in which farm forestry can be better integrated into the new CAP. This is to ensure that there are no barriers to planting while also providing for possible tree-planting measures under the new CAP through, for example, new agri-environment schemes.</p></reply>

The CCAC report is a useful supplement to the Teagasc GHG Marginal Abatement Cost Curve which sets out a range of available mitigation tools based on efficiencies and technologies which can reduce emissions without reducing numbers.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that Teagasc also prepared a parallel analysis of six scenarios illustrating a range of activity levels and associated GHG emissions for the sector. This scenario analysis informed the Teagasc MACC curve on which the agricultural actions within the All-of-Government Climate Action Plan are based. </p>  <p>  Based on the Teagasc MACC curve, provided we implement all of the mitigation actions identified early and to the highest feasible level of adoption, the comprehensive targets set for the sector across emission reductions, sequestration and contributing to energy production are achievable.

This designation means that all areas under these features are eligible for payment under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS) and other area-based schemes. Regardless of the purpose of funding from my Department, landscape features are protected under the requirements of GAEC meaning that, in general, they cannot be removed, damaged or interfered with. </p>  <p>   Where, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to remove a hedgerow, remove a line of trees or fill in a drain for good reasons such as farmyard expansion, farmers may do so provided a new hedgerow, new line of trees or drain of equal length is planted/dug in advance of the removal of the old hedgerow, line of trees or drain on the holding. Farmers can only replace like-with-like, for example you cannot replace a length of hedgerow with a line of trees. When replacing a hedgerow, the species used must be traditional to the area and the replacement hedge cannot be for amenity purposes, e.g. around a farmyard or driveway. In the case of land designated as SAC or SPA, hedgerows or drains cannot be removed without the prior approval of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p>  <p>  Hedgerows must be maintained and encroachment into a field must be avoided.</p>  <p>  To ensure compliance with these requirements, the Department uses a combination of ortho photography/satellite imagery and ground checks to confirm the presence and maintenance of landscape features. If an applicant is found to be in breach of the requirements, a sanction may apply under all area-based schemes and, in all cases, the removed landscaped feature must be reinstated.</p>  <p>  Field boundaries such as hedgerows, stone walls and clay banks are also afforded protection under the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) Regulations (EIA) S.I. 456 of 2011 (as amended by S.I. No. 142 of 2013 and S.I. No. 407 of 2017). </p>  <p>  The EIA Regulations set down clear requirements in respect of screening and approval of certain works on farms. These Regulations apply to three different types of activities;</p>  <p>  - Restructuring of rural land holdings i.e. removal of field boundaries </p>  <p>  - Commencing to use uncultivated land or semi natural areas for intensive agriculture </p>  <p>  - Land drainage works on land used for agriculture </p>  <p>  Should a farmer intend to undertake any of these activities, screening and approval by my Department may be required under the EIA Regulations. An EIA Guidance document is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Farmers are made aware of their responsibilities regarding Landscape Features and other Cross Compliance requirements through a number of channels. My Department&rsquo;s website provides information on all aspects of Cross Compliance and inspections. In 2016, an &lsquo;Explanatory Handbook for Cross Compliance Requirements&rsquo; was issued to all herd owners.</p>  <p>  Staff of my Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, held a series of Cross Compliance events throughout the country during 2018 and 2019. These events afforded Department staff an opportunity to engage directly with farmers and assist them in furthering their knowledge and understanding of the Cross Compliance requirements including those surrounding hedgerows.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;135m was provided in Grant Aid in 2019, an increase of &euro;2.7m on 2018. The allocation of that funding between the various services is an operational matter for Teagasc and its governing Authority. </p>  <p>  The fee structure for Teagasc advisory services is structured to ensure that the service is accessible to all farmers by having a range of services that farmers can avail of with different fees. The current fee schedule and methodology is open and transparent and available on the Teagasc website. </p>  <p>  As regards the Common Agricultural Policy 2021-2027, negotiations on the draft proposals are continuing at EU level. While significant progress has been made to date, decisions on key issues have still to be agreed upon at EU level,  including those relating to Farm Advisory Services.</p></reply>

These credits provide a means to assist the agricultural sector to contribute to Ireland's ambition on climate action. This flexibility should not be seen as an offsetting proposal but rather, as an effort to broaden the &ldquo;toolbox&rdquo; of abatement options available to achieve targets, in particular for Ireland where existing abatement measures are costly and action in the LULUCF sector, that encourages removals and limits emissions, presents a more cost effective option.</p>  <p>  Mobilising these credits will require the combined efforts of forest, cropland and grassland management. The Teagasc MACC outlines the specific types of actions explored to date and this does not presently include agro forestry options or cropping options on &lsquo;new&rsquo; agricultural areas.  The forestry analysis carried out in support of the MACC was based on trees planted at conventional stocking i.e. lands converted to 100% forestry. </p>  <p>  Agroforestry is defined as widely spaced trees on grassland or cropland and my Department provides funding for agroforestry under the afforestation scheme as one of a suite of options but take up by landowners has been limited to date.</p></reply>

It has been, and remains, that the Government's preferred outcome is a deal on the basis of the Withdrawal Agreement. This is the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal, protect the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border. Without a Withdrawal Agreement, avoiding a border would become more complex and challenging. There are no easy answers, and any solution will be suboptimal compared to the backstop contained in the Withdrawal Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Contingency Action Plan Update of July 2019 makes it clear that a no-deal Brexit would result in far-reaching change on the island of Ireland. The Government is working closely with the European Commission to meet the shared, twin objectives of protecting the Single Market and Ireland's place in it, and avoiding physical infrastructure at the border. This work is looking at the necessary checks to preserve Ireland's full participation in the Single Market and Customs Union, and this work is on-going. </p>  <p>  Avoiding the return of a hard border is a Government priority. The Government must protect peace on the island and the success of the all-island economy. This is why the backstop continues to be a critical component of the Withdrawal Agreement, unless and until a realistic, legally-binding, and practical alternative is found. As the Taoiseach made clear in his comments, no such proposal has been received to date.</p></reply>

My Department is now conducting a consultation (see link here ) which provides an opportunity for broadband infrastructure operators to review the NBP Map to ensure that it correctly represents the information provided by them in the course of past mapping and public consultation exercises.</p>  <p>  The consultation also seeks to assist the Department in its ongoing monitoring of commercial roll out. eir has reported that an additional circa 34,000 premises outside but contiguous to the 300,000 rural deployment have also been passed at the end of June 2019. However, as these premises are not covered by the Commitment Agreement signed by eir in April 2017, they have to date remained in the Intervention Area i.e. represented as AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map. Where eir demonstrates that these premises are in fact passed and subject to providing sufficient assurances that at least 95% of orders received from these premises will be connected at the standard regulated connection charge, the NBP map could be revised to reflect this. The consultation also seeks to identify premises where commercial plans have not materialised and, similar to the update to the NBP Map in 2017 where 84,500 premises were brought back into the Intervention Area, premises previously marked as commercially served could be brought into the Intervention Area as part of this consultation process.</p></reply>

The plan sets out, for the first time, the actions Ireland needs to take to reach our 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and also puts Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p><p>I welcomed the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action which worked for months to establish a broad cross party consensus on a number of difficult issues, including a recommendation in favour of increasing the carbon tax to &euro;80/t by 2030. The Government then adopted a similar commitment in the Climate Action Plan, as one action of the over 180 actions in the Plan. In so doing, the Joint Oireachtas Committee and the government are acting on the best advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council. </p><p>At a recent meeting of the Budget Oversight Committee, the Chair of the Climate Change Advisory Council stated that &quot;a massive body of evidence from across the world shows that carbon taxes are essential. There are very few carbon tax deniers in the economics community. A recent statement by a large number of American economists, including 27 Nobel prize winners, identified carbon taxes as essential for the US and the world.&quot;</p><p>The government has been taking a number of steps to combat energy poverty: </p><p>- &euro;26.3m funding between 2016 and 2019 for the Warmth and Wellbeing Scheme which targets those suffering from chronic health conditions. </p><p>- The eligibility criteria for the Warmer Homes Scheme was expanded to capture more people suffering deprivation. Deeper measures are also now provided under the scheme. A total of &euro;105.7m has been provided for this scheme between 2016 and 2019 supporting over 20,500 energy efficiency upgrades during that period. </p><p>- &euro;79m in funding has been provided to the Better Energy Community Scheme between 2016 and 2019 which has supported innovative, community-led initiatives, some of which have helped to address energy poverty.</p><p>- The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has ensured that competitive energy markets are working for all consumers, including those in, or at risk of, energy poverty. </p><p>The Climate Action Plan commits to reviewing ways to improve how current energy poverty schemes target those most in need. That work is underway. </p><p>The Department of Finance is also completing a distributional analysis of an increase in the carbon tax trajectory and the impact this will have on different groups, including those in poverty. </p><p>The question of how the carbon tax will impact on different income cohorts was examined in the recently published ESRI report titled &lsquo;Carbon taxation in Ireland: distributional effects of revenue recycling policies&rsquo;. This report is available at: . </p><p>A public consultation to ascertain the views of the public on the options for the use of revenues raised from increases in the Carbon Tax recently concluded. The Department of Finance consultation paper identified a range of potential options including a number of fuel poverty options. A copy of the consultation paper can be downloaded from: </p></reply>

Under this plan, Ireland will become one of the first countries in the world to ensure that those in rural areas have the same digital opportunities as those in urban areas.    The premises referenced by the Deputy is located in the AMBER area on the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map, which is available on my Department's website at www.broadband.gov.ie. The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP. </p>  <p>  The State intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network.

In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p>  <p>  The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p>  <p>  Work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently.

The ESB&rsquo;s midlands fisheries are managed by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) by agreement with the ESB including and arrangement for IFI to use the permit fees, due to ESB as fishery owners, from these fisheries to fund the management costs. These costs are additional to IFI&rsquo;s costs for managing State owned fisheries. ESB charge similar fees for its directly managed fisheries. </p>  <p>  The practice of charging permit fees is long established and angling clubs that licence a fishery from the State may also charge a permit for anglers, not a member of the club. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that a significant portion of the permit revenue is redistributed by IFI into the catchments by way of the Midlands Fisheries Fund which provides funding to angling clubs, community groups etc. to enhance those fisheries. </p>  <p>  Annual permit fees amount to 86c per week for adults, 48c per week for senior citizens and 38c per week for juveniles. Permits for shorter periods are also available. </p>  <p>  Section 178 of the Fisheries Consolidation Act 1959 provides that it is an offence to fish in a private fishery without the required authorisation. IFI are charged with enforcing this section and section 80 of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 provides that a fixed charge notice may be issued in respect of such offences. </p></reply>

Salmon in all waters in Ireland are afforded specific protection via established fisheries policy, licensing, tagging, the opening, closing or catch and release provisions for fisheries based on the state of their individual stock and annual conservation legislation initiated by the Department. All of this is underpinned by annual scientific assessment of each of Ireland&rsquo;s more than 140 genetically distinct salmon fisheries. Ireland&rsquo;s protection of salmon is considered best in class internationally and aligns fully with the EU Habitats Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles. </p>  <p>  The salmon management regime also applies to sea-trout over 40cms in length and the potential to extend similar protection policies to other salmonid species could be considered to afford particular protection to salmonids generally.</p></reply>

This provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. Mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging was not introduced. ​A Price Monitoring Group (PMG) was established in mid-2017 to monitor the on-going cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the &lsquo;flat-rate structure&rsquo; was being phased out. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend has been relative price stability.

The Council notes that emissions from agriculture represent approximately one third of total emissions and that emissions increased by 2.9% in 2017 compared to 2016, and by 6.9% relative to 2014. The Council's Annual Review notes that this has largely been driven by the removal of quotas on dairy production, resulting in higher dairy cow numbers with an increase in milk production.   To address the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland, I published the Climate Action Plan on 17 June. The Plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Plan requires a significant step-up in ambition, with a target abatement range for each of the key sectors that contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions: Electricity, Enterprise, Built Environment, Transport, Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use, Waste and the Circular Economy, and the Public Sector.</p>  <p>  The Plan identifies a 10% - 15% reduction in emissions from agriculture, relative to business as usual projections. It sets out a range of actions to: reduce emissions on farms; promote afforestation and diversification of land use; develop opportunities in the bio-economy and in the supply of substitutes for fossil fuels; promote better management of peatlands and soils; and develop clusters of best practice. Implementation of these actions will, collectively, help to further underpin the environmental credentials of the Irish agriculture sector and better position it to meet the evolving expectations of both domestic and international markets. This, in turn, will help prepare the sector for longer-term restructuring and adaptation that will be required to meet our carbon neutrality objectives.</p>  <p>  In relation to the costs of purchasing carbon credits for compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s emissions targets for the period 2013 to 2020 under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision 406/2009/EC (ESD), my Department currently estimates the additional costs to be in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required. This is in addition to a total of &euro;120 million that has already been spent as part of Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to meet its targets under the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008-2012), arising from which approximately 5,500,000 carbon credits are currently held by the State, which may be used for ESD compliance. I expect that the costs associated with purchasing additional carbon credits will arise over the period to 2022 and that sufficient provision will be made in my Department's Vote for this purpose.</p></reply>

The Plan, therefore, includes a range of actions aimed at reducing emissions from agricultural land use, promoting increased rates of afforestation and improving the management of Ireland&rsquo;s peatlands.Peatlands cover 21% of our land area. A high proportion of this is under agricultural and other uses, with 16% designated for nature conservation purposes. Peatlands represent 64% of our total soil organic carbon stock, representing the largest store of carbon in the Irish landscape. The Climate Action Plan commits to better management of Ireland's carbon sinks with a range of measures such as:</p><p>- restoring / rewetting all raised bogs designated as Special Areas of Conservation and Natural Heritage Areas within three cycles of the <i>National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022</i>. Such restoration measures and hydrological management of our protected peatlands will halt and reduce peat oxidation and carbon loss; </p><p>- undertaking further research to assess the potential to sequester, store and reduce emissions of carbon through the management, restoration and rehabilitation of peatlands as outlined in the <i>National Peatlands Strategy</i>; </p><p>- realising the emissions reduction potential of at least 40,000 hectares of grasslands on drained organic soils, yielding up to an additional 0.44 Mt in sequestered carbon dioxide annually between 2021 and 2030. Priority actions include identifying precisely which areas of carbon-rich and drained organic agricultural soils are suitable for water-table-management techniques to reduce carbon losses. This work will inform the development of agri-environment policies, including the new CAP, recognising regionally differentiated strategies may be appropriate; and </p><p>- creating additional incentives to adopt carbon-positive, post-production management options on Bord na M&oacute;na lands, and similar options on other commercial and private peat extraction sites. </p></reply>

Almost two thirds of renewable energy used in Ireland comes from renewable electricity. </p>  <p>  The Government has published and started implementing the Climate Action Plan, which sets out the actions which must be taken in order for Ireland to meet its climate targets. </p>  <p>The Climate Action Plan includes a 70% target of our electricity coming from renewable sources. The majority of this target will be delivered by an increase in on-shore and off-shore wind, as well as solar. However, when Ireland meets its renewable electricity target for 2030, having fully removed coal and peat from electricity generation, there will still be a requirement for back-up when the level of wind needed or the level of sunshine is not available. </p>  <p>  For example, in a recent 30 day period, 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity was provided by wind generation. However, over this same period, one day had only 4% of our electricty provided by wind and on another day it provided 62% of our electricty. To ensure that power is still available on a day or a week where there is very little wind, it will be necessary to consider the appropriate fuel mix in reaching 70% renewable electricity. </p>  <p>  In all projected transitions to a low carbon economy by 2050, gas will continue to play a role in sustaining the transition. It plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more CO2-intensive fossil fuels. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, gas-fired electricity generation is well placed to address the intermittency of wind and solar supplies and provide back-up flexibility and reliability for our electricity supply. While batteries, greater interconnection and demand side response will play a role, gas fired power stations will provide flexible and reliable electricity, particularly when weather powered, intermittent sources of energy can be very low for prolonged periods of time, possibly lasting weeks at a time. </p>  <p>  In relation to LNG projects, commercial developers have proposed a number of projects, including the Shannon LNG project and another project in Cork. Final investment decisions for these projects and compliance with any legal and regulatory requirements in relation to consents or permits are the responsibility of the project promoters. </p>  <p>  The production, sourcing, buying and selling of natural gas produced outside this jurisdiction would also be an operational matter for the undertakings involved. Any undertaking would be required to comply with EU law in this area. In relation to fracked gas in Ireland, the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Act 2017 provides for the prohibition of exploration for and extraction of onshore petroleum by means of hydraulic fracturing. </p>  <p>  All Projects of Common Interest must fulfil the conditions on environmental assessment procedures provided for in both national and European law. EU Regulation 347/2013, which provides for the designation of a project of common interest, does not override the requirement to comply with environmental law. Any legal and regulatory requirements of the permit granting process, including environmental assessment, are the responsibility of the individual project promoters. Decisions on consents for the construction of an LNG plant would be a matter for the relevant consenting authorities, including the Environmental Protection Agency, where appropriate. </p>  <p>  My Department will undertake an evaluation of security of energy supply taking into account our transition to a zero carbon world so we can make decisions based on evidence. This review will include a full consideration of international evidence. </p></reply>

The Plan recognises the current position that a number of different bodies are responsible for the management of Ireland's peatlands and identifies the relevant lead responsible body and relevant stakeholders in respect of each action. In this respect, I am satisfied that the Plan provides for effective implementation of actions relating to the management of peatlands.    The plan also established a Climate Action Delivery Board to oversee the delivery of all actions in the Plan and to hold each Department and public body to account for their responsibilities under the Plan.

It is an independent statutory body, solely accountable to a committee of the Oireachtas for the performance of its functions. The Electricity Regulation Act (ERA), 1999, as amended, sets out the statutory duties, functions and powers of the CRU. </p>  <p>  The legislation stipulates, inter alia, that the CRU has due regard of the need to promote the use of renewable, sustainable or alternative forms of energy, and take into account protection of the environment. The CRU also has the duty in the Act to carry out its functions and exercise the powers conferred on it under the Act in a manner which, inter alia, the Commission considers protects the interests of final customers of electricity or gas or both, as the case may be.</p>  <p>  The Clean Energy Package is a fundamental update of the EU&rsquo;s energy policy framework to facilitate the transition away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy and to deliver on the EU&rsquo;s Paris Agreement commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Package is in the process of transposition and may involve amending CRU&rsquo;s statutory duties, functions and powers in order to give effect to the Package by the due date.</p>  <p>  There are a range of actions in the Climate Action Plan where the CRU has been assigned the lead role and are progressing the actions accordingly</p>  <p>  My Department's Statement of Strategy 2019- 2021 includes an action being progressed by CRU to review its regulatory policies, rules and decisions on electricity generation to assess how they support Ireland&rsquo;s decarbonisation commitments and energy policy objectives.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the necessity for such a specific additional amendment regarding prioritising the functions of the CRU in this way has not been identified and is not being considered.</p>  <p>  Regarding a Ministerial instruction to the CRU, Section 10A of the ERA outlines the procedure under which &ldquo;general policy directions&rdquo; may be given to the regulator authority, including details on the tasks and inter-alia timelines and consultation requirements with the independent regulator and Oireachtas. The legislation also identifies restrictions on the areas where policy directions may not be given, including a prohibition on a Ministerial policy direction to the regulator for the performance of its functions in relation to individual holders of licences.</p>  <p>  In addition, the European energy regulatory regime provides that EU Member States must guarantee the independence of National Regulatory Authorities and that they are expressively forbidden from taking direct instructions from government. The regime also restricts policy directions in the form of general policy guidelines in certain areas that are prescribed regulatory duties and powers in the EU Energy acquis. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan (Action 147) includes a commitment to introduce Climate Action Mandates for every public body through the use of Ministerial policy direction, or equivalent power, which in the case of CRU will be aligned with the existing domestic electricity regulatory framework and the EU electricity regulatory regime.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in its recently published Strategy Statement 2019-2021 the CRU identified &ldquo;Delivering sustainable low-carbon solutions with well regulated markets and networks&rdquo; as the first of its four strategic priorities.</p></reply>

These actions include:   - introducing a capital support that will be provided to Local Authorities for the development of on-street public chargers; </p>  <p>  - commencing the ESB Electric Vehicle High Power Charging Infrastructure Development Project, supported by the Climate Action Fund; </p>  <p>  - including electric vehicle fast chargers as a category eligible for support in the next call from Climate Action Fund; </p>  <p>  - expanding the Electric Vehicle Home Charger Grant to include shared parking (e.g. in apartment blocks); </p>  <p>  - developing and implementing planning rules and guidelines across residential and non-residential parking locations for electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and </p>  <p>  - developing an overarching charging infrastructure strategy with a view to the supply of infrastructure to stay ahead of demand.</p>  <p>  Last month, I announced funding to support the rollout by Local Authorities of up to 1,000 on-street public charge points for electric vehicles over the next 5 years. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will administer a scheme where Local Authorities can apply for funding to develop on-street charging infrastructure. The detailed terms and conditions for the scheme are currently being developed and I expect the scheme to open for applications shortly. </p>  <p>  In addition, we will introduce new regulations to require non-domestic buildings with over 20 car parking spaces to install charging facilities. </p>  <p>  In addition, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB ecars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network. This project includes the installation of 90 high-power chargers each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously, upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to fast chargers and replacing over 250 existing standard chargers with next generation high reliability models. This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022. The locations of the chargers that will be installed as part of this project have not been finalised. However, a provisional map of the planned network, showing indicative locations, was developed by ESB ecars and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

Through bye-laws, these local authorities set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations.</p>  <p>  In February 2011, Dublin City Council (DCC) took over responsibility for the licensing of horse-drawn carriage operators and drivers from the Garda Carriage Office. DCC made bye-laws in the same year for the licensing of horse-drawn carriages under the Local Government Act, 2001. </p>  <p>  In 2018 DCC became aware that - specifically in relation to Dublin - this legal basis for making such bye-laws could be uncertain, as the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 had vested the power to regulate horse-drawn carriages in Dublin with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, to whom An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the successor. </p>  <p>  My Department examined this issue and, following legal advice, is now of the view that the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 remain in force and preclude DCC from enacting the relevant bye-laws.  Also, it seems that a simple repeal of the Victorian legislation alone may not be sufficient to enable DCC to enact bye-laws for horse-drawn carriages.  Therefore, my Department is now working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to identify how best to empower DCC to regulate this area.</p></reply>

The proposed facility would comprise a 250-metre cycling track, 12-16 Badminton Courts in the in-track area, spectator seating and ancillary facilities including office space.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland's Master Plan for the Campus includes several large infrastructure projects, many of which have been delivered.  Preparatory work on the National Velodrome and Badminton Centre, which is an important project on the Master Plan, is underway. In July 2019, given the period of time that has lapsed since the Velodrome was initially proposed, Sport Ireland appointed project managers and a design team to carry out a review of the project. Initial work will focus on a review of the existing planning permission, granted in 2015, to assess suitability and fitness for present and future purposes.  This review will be completed later this year, and, subject to the necessary resources being available, it is intended that the project would go to tender in 2020.</p></reply>

The EWS comprises the statutory functions relating to Educational Welfare Officers; the operationalisation of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme; and the funding of the School Completion Programme (SCP).</p>  <p>  The 124 SCP projects are funded in line with the academic term, commencing in September each year. Funding provision for the SCP in the 2018/2019 school year stands at &euro;24.7 million.

The lack of consistency of care together with high staff turnover levels impacts directly on quality, and low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill the workforce. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care practitioners has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better child outcomes.</p>  <p>  Over the past 4 budgets the level of public investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare services has increased by 117%. The level of investment needs to continue to rise if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure staff wages and conditions will improve.</p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff. </p>  <p>  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. </p>  <p>  I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. Under the terms of industrial relations legislation, for the process of establishing a Sectoral Employment Order to commence, the bodies commencing the process must satisfy the Labour Court that they are "substantially representative" of either the workers or the employers in the sector. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will readily co-operate with a Sectoral Employment Order process when it is under way. </p>  <p>  In the interim, I have introduced a range of measures to support employers to improve pay and conditions. These include a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; annual Programme Support Payments to recognise administrative demands; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.</p>  <p>  I have set out my vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in First 5, which contains a commitment to develop a Workforce Development Plan. This Plan, work on which began recently, will identify measures to ensure appropriate numbers of early learning and care and school-age childcare staff at all levels in the sector, to achieve a graduate-led workforce by 2028, and to raise the profile of careers in the sector. As part of this work, a series of public consultations will be carried out involving those working in the sector and other stakeholders. Plans for the consultation process will be finalised in the coming weeks. First 5 also commits to develop a new funding model for the sector, which may open up new mechanisms to influence pay and conditions in the sector.</p></reply>

This general responsibility includes the provision of early childhood, primary, post-primary and higher education and the range of related provision and supports. Children in care, with the exception of the very small number in special care centres, access these forms of education on the same basis as their peers who are not in the care of the State. For the very small number of children who require special care (14 children at the end of Q1 2019), specialised educational and clinical services are provided by the special care centre.</p>  <p>  Education plays a critical role in every child&rsquo;s life, none more so than children who are in the care of the State. For children who have experienced disadvantage in their early life education can provide an opportunity to break the cycle of disadvantage and create a different future.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, educational needs form a central part of care planning for children in the care of the State. In the same vein, the aftercare provisions of the Child Care Act 1991 (as amended) require the educational needs of the child or eligible young person to from part of their statutory assessment of need for aftercare supports. </p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, provides a wide range of data relating to children in care and the wider child protection system. National administrative data on the educational experience of Ireland&rsquo;s care population is made available in Tusla&rsquo;s quarterly performance and activity reports, which are published on the Tusla website. </p>  <p>  This data provides detail on children&rsquo;s participation in education, including the number of children in care and the number of young adults in aftercare who are in full time education. The aftercare data has recently been developed further, with figures available from Q2 2018 for the number of young adults in receipt of an aftercare service who are (i) in Second Level education, (ii) in Vocational Training (including Youthreach schemes), (iii) in PLCs, (iv) in Third Level College/University, or (v) in Accredited Training (e.g. Solas). Figures for Q1 2019 show that:</p>  <p>  -  96% (3,690 of 3,835) of children in care aged 6-15 were in full time education;</p>  <p>  -  91% (914 of 1,001) of children in care aged 16-17 were in full time education; and</p>  <p>  -  67% (1,221 of 1,825) of young people aged 18-22 years in aftercare were in education or </p>  <p>  My officials will continue to work with Tusla to explore how we can improve measurement of educational outcomes for children in care, as a first step toward improving these outcomes.</p></reply>

In recognition of the higher risks and life-long consequences of child poverty, the Government set a child-specific poverty target in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People (2014-2020), to reduce consistent child poverty by at least two-thirds on 2011 levels by 2020. </p><p>Under the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures Framework, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is leading our collective efforts in taking a whole-of-Government approach to tackling child poverty, which includes the issue of child homelessness. My Department is, of course, central to this response as outlined in the following:</p><p>First, the Sponsors Group of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures are advancing five cross sectoral priorities on an annual basis. These include; First 5 Strategy (DCYA), Healthy Ireland (DoH), child poverty (DEASP), wellbeing in schools (DES) and child homelessness (DHPLG). </p><p>Second, a whole-of-Government approach is being advanced to tackle child poverty in Ireland. This approach is based on the plans produced by the Sponsors Group and National Advisory Council under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures and detailed in the DEASP&rsquo;s paper &lsquo;A Whole-of-Government Approach to Tackling Child Poverty&rsquo;. </p><p>The paper deals with many of the issues highlighted by the Deputy including six key priorities:</p><p>1.  Universal GP care for U6s and the future extension to U12s and U18s</p><p>2.  Reducing the cost of education</p><p>3.  Reducing the cost of housing</p><p>4.  Affordable childcare </p><p>5.  Labour activation </p><p>6. Provision of in-work benefits. </p><p>Third, at my request in February 2019, I asked the Advisory Council to refresh and prioritise their proposals in how best the issues of child poverty could be addressed in the immediate term. This draft paper has recently been received. Some of the key recommendations relate to:</p><p>1.  Building Government capacity though a central lead point on Child Poverty</p><p>2.  Monitoring and Documenting Trends on Child Poverty</p><p>3.  Tackling Intergenerational Poverty and Building Strong Communities</p><p>I am actively considering the recommendations from the Advisory Council, while also advancing a number of key initiatives that support some of these recommendations. This is being done through focussed research internally within my Department, as well as through our forthcoming National Childcare Scheme. This scheme aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, support lifelong learning, and reduce the cost of quality childcare for families across Ireland and to help reduce child poverty.</p><p>The above developments will inform the work of the Sponsors group and Advisory Council to ensure greater coordination and targeting of our efforts in addressing child poverty and homelessness so as we sustain a cross-government approach.</p><p>I will of course be liaising with Cabinet colleagues on these developments and in advancing solutions to these most intractable issues.</p></reply>

Given the many demands on a Special Rapporteur&rsquo;s time an invitation issued at the start of a term of office presents a better opportunity for a favourable response.</p>  <p>  The invitation was issued by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in accordance with his role and competence in managing international relations on behalf of the State.  The invitation did not issue from my Office. The invitation was confirmed in a press release on Tuesday 1st May, 2018. This press release is accessible on my Department&rsquo;s website. Statements I made in various fora, including in this House, regarding the proposed invitation were at all times consistent with the Government&rsquo;s deliberations and subsequent arrangements for this invitation to issue. </p>  <p>  As I have said previously, I would welcome the engagement of the Special Rapporteur as I believe his Office can assist our shared endeavours to establish the truth and advise on how best we can move forward in appropriately responding to this difficult and painful part of our history.</p></reply>

As part of that re-organisation, CIB issued a notice of termination at end July 2019  under the terms of  its service agreement, which allows CIB to terminate the agreement, without cause, at any time by giving four months prior written notice. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that CIB,  which has statutory responsibility for MABS, including the company referred to by the Deputy, has confirmed to my  Department  that in the reorganisation proposed, all employees will retain their jobs, their terms and conditions of employment and will continue in their current place of employment. There will be no reduction in the money advice and budgeting services offered to the public as a result of this reorganisation.</p>  <p>  CIB's intention is that staff currently employed  on the Helpline will transfer to the Citizens Information Phone Service (CIPS) company. CIPS is the dedicated phone service for calls relating to citizens information queries and operates on a national basis, similar to the MABS Helpline.  All of the  Helpline staff will be retained at their current base in Blanchardstown.</p>  <p>  CIB's intention is that the remaining staff will transfer to a new support services company to further develop and enhance the functions of MABS in relation to training and quality, and will work closely with the regional MABS companies  to establish new services in the future. This company will continue to operate from the current MABS ND premises in Blanchardstown.  CIB is currently engaged in progressing arrangements for the establishment of that new company and for the orderly transfer of staff thereto.</p>  <p>  All staff transfers will be conducted under the TUPE regulations which offer protection to all employees ( SI 131/2003 EC ( Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003) </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department operates a number of funding programmes that assist local authorities to work in partnership with AHBs to construct, purchase or lease new homes and make them available for social housing.</p><p>This funding is underpinned by either mortgage agreements, capital advance agreements, leases or Payment and Availability agreements (P&amp;amp;A) which set out the terms and conditions of the funding and the specific responsibilities the AHB has for the properties and their tenants. </p><p>Where an AHB has purchased or constructed a property that is in their ownership, the responsibility for management and maintenance of that property is a matter for them to meet, in most cases, from their own income. This income is derived, in the main, from a combination of rent payments from the tenant and monthly payments made by the local authority to the AHB in accordance with a P&amp;amp;A agreement which is in place for each of these properties. The Agreements entered into under this model can be for a long period of time, up to 30 years, which may place additional cyclical maintenance/life cycle costs responsibilities on the AHB. </p><p>The main area in which specific management and maintenance fees or ongoing supports are provided relate to the now closed Capital Loan &amp;amp; Subsidy Scheme (CLSS). The vast majority of CLSS funding is for the repayment of loan charges (principle and interest) to the Housing Finance Agency, in respect of loans advanced to the AHBs for their delivery of new social housing under the CLSS. The balance of the CLSS funding provided is in respect of a management and maintenance allowance for the upkeep, by the AHBs, of the CLSS funded properties, in line with the terms of scheme. The amounts paid under the CLSS since 2017 are as follows: <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Loan Charges</th><th>Management and Maintenance Allowance</th></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;41,620,966</td><td>&euro;4,300,377</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;48,994,521</td><td>&euro;4,213,362</td></tr><tr><td>2019*</td><td>&euro;39,787,388</td><td>&euro;2,143,179</td></tr></table></p><p>In relation to subsidies, my Department does not provide AHBs, or local authorities for onward payment to AHBs, with financial subsidies towards AHBs&rsquo; general operational running costs and administration. Funding is available to cover elements of the cost of administering various agreements and related outlay in the initial period of a new property becoming available for social housing under various arrangements. Specifically, there are two separate forms of start-up funding available to AHBs which are funded by local authorities and recouped to them by my Department:</p><p>- Capital start-up funding up to 1.5% of the capital cost of either the acquisition, construction or refurbishment of the homes being made available under a P&amp;amp;A agreement that has received a Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) loan from the local authority;</p><p>- Leasing/P&amp;amp;A start-up funding up to 5% of the value of the first year&rsquo;s P&amp;amp;A payment on a property.</p><p>In the case of CALF start-up costs, the capital cost is verified with vouched expenditure by the local authority at the signing of the Capital Advance Agreement, i.e. the loan agreement, and the start-up claims are subsequently drawn down post-completion of the properties. As of 1 July 2019, AHBs drawdown start-up funds from the local authorities, who certify that the funding is being used for the purpose intended and in line with the terms of the scheme. As the statutory housing authorities, local authorities are responsible for the administration of the funding and I am satisfied that they are managing the funding in a responsible manner. The amounts paid since 2017 are as follows:  <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>1.5% Capital Cost Start-funding paid </th><th>5% Leasing/ P&amp;amp;A Start-up funding paid</th></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;0.9m</td><td>&euro;398,700</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;2.5m</td><td>&euro;513,760</td></tr><tr><td>2019*</td><td>&euro;1.09m</td><td>&euro;266,673</td></tr></table></p><p>*Year to date</p></reply>

The Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in Irish Water&rsquo;s Investment Plan. Irish Water will work with local authorities across the country in ensuring that investment is made where it is needed most, aligned to local authority core strategies. It is in that context that investment decisions in relation to individual projects will be made. </p>  <p>  Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

The Expert Panel&rsquo;s membership includes Departmental, stakeholder and independent representation.</p>  <p>  The Expert Panel has made recommendations to my Department on the suitability of schemes and projects for funding based on objective criteria which are set out in the framework document issued to local authorities when requesting proposals. I expect to conclude consideration of the Panel's recommendations and to make an announcement of the allocations shortly.</p></reply>

The PRAs Digital Mapping Project ran from September 2005 to September 2010.  This was a major transformation project involving the digitisation of approximately 2.4 million land parcels, made up of approximately 15 million line segments. The Project is complete, with 99.9% of land parcels successfully digitally mapped with issues resolved. As can be expected, some residual and historical issues, which existed in the paper-based pre-digital system, came to light during the process. The vast bulk of such issues were dealt with and any outstanding issues are resolved on an ongoing basis. Such unresolved issues represent only 0.1% of the overall number of registered land parcels.</p></reply>

It also required planning authorities to undertake appropriate monitoring of planning enforcement and directed them to prioritise large-scale unauthorised development and enforcement cases. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Planning Regulator has powers under section 31P of the 2000 Act to conduct reviews of the performance by planning authorities of their respective functions and to oversee the delivery of effective planning services to the public by planning authorities.</p></reply>

Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. </p><p>In relation to the specific case referred to by the Deputy, my Department understands from the relevant local authority that their Building Control Officer is actively engaging with the builder and the assigned certifier to ensure the issues involved are remediated and compliance with the Building Regulations is achieved, as a priority. </p><p>The Safe as Houses report referred to has been considered by my Department and while I can subscribe to many of the principles in the report, I believe that the established building control reform agenda, with its many initiatives, already provides a comprehensive roadmap for embedding a culture of compliance and accountability within the construction industry and for strengthening the building control framework generally.</p><p>It was through the <i>Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, </i>known within the industry as BCAR, and accompanying code of practice that the roles and responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, assigned certifiers have been set out and clarified. BCAR requires the owner to assign competent persons to design, build, inspect and certify building works he/she has commissioned. They in turn, must account for their contribution through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates.  <i></i></p><p>If and when issues arise whether pre, during or post construction, it is clear who has held the designated roles and who is responsible for addressing the issues. This facilitates and simplifies the inspection, implementation and enforcement role of the Building Control Authority. </p><p>The building control function has been strengthened by the establishment of the National Building Control Office, which provides oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of building control in local authorities. The inspections policy has been reviewed and developed to support local authorities identify risk and make the most efficient and effective use of the resources available.</p><p>In addition, the Government has committed to placing the Construction Industry Register Ireland, or CIRI, on a statutory footing. The Government approved the draft heads of a Bill to place the CIRI on a statutory footing and the Bill was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Committee&rsquo;s report has since been received. The Department is currently working through the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations and engaging with the Attorney General's Office, with a view to achieving publication of the Bill in early 2020. The main objective of the legislation is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with Building Regulations within the builder community. </p><p>The building control reform agenda&rsquo;s focus has primarily been on ensuring strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry and on improving compliance in the Building Regulations. This reduces the risk and the incidences of defective buildings and has provided insurance underwriters with sufficient confidence to introduce new latent defect type products in Ireland, despite a general retrenchment and conservatism in the wider insurance industry. These new insurance products are first party insurance policies which cover damage and non- damage (breaches of building regulations) claims, to varying degrees. This means that the purchaser does not have to make a claim through the builder but can submit a claim directly to the insurer.</p></reply>

The State has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters. It is not possible for the State to take on responsibility/liability for all legacy issues nor would it send the right message to the industry regarding their responsibility for compliance.</p>  <p>  My focus will remain firmly on ensuring the full roll out of the Building Control reform agenda, to ensure that all those that engaged in the construction sector take their responsibilities seriously and are appropriately held to account.  As part of the reform agenda, consumer protection will continue to be my core concern and any proposals in that regard will, of course, be considered.</p></reply>

The receipt of calls from the public for assistance by the fire service is provided on a 'shared service' basis by three Regional Communications Centres (RCCs) at Limerick, Castlebar and Dublin.  </p>  <p>  My Department supports fire authorities mainly through setting national policy and co-ordinating its implementation; providing capital funding for fire appliances, emergency equipment and the construction and upgrading of fire stations; centralised training programmes and co-ordination of the development of guidance on operational and other fire service related matters.  </p>  <p>  I understand that all calls for fire service assistance are initially answered by the 999/112 Emergency Call Answering Service (ECAS). The ECAS service asks the caller which of the emergency services they wish to be connected to.  Calls for the fire service are then transferred to one of the three RCCs. The operators in the RCC take relevant information from the caller. A Computer-Aided Mobilising System holds data on the Pre-Determined Attendances (PDAs) for each category of incident and every address in the country. </p>  <p>  Once alerted by the RCC, the appropriate response is then decided by the Chief Fire Officer of each fire service, having regard to national policy, including the PDAs. Where appropriate, the nearest available fire brigade resources and appliances will attend. PDAs are reviewed periodically, but there has been no recent policy change in relation to the mobilisation of fire services to road traffic accidents (RTA).  </p>  <p>  Fire service mobilisation can also occur on foot of requests from the other emergency services attending an incident. In this regard, I understand that it would not be routine for the Ambulance Service or Garda&iacute; to mobilise Fire Services to a road traffic accident (RTA) unless extrication of casualties from a vehicle wreckage was required or there was a significant oil spill on the road. It is estimated that fire services attendance is requested at approximately 10% of RTAs. </p></reply>

It is important to note that the local authority is not a party to the tenancy and has no role in its agreement. There is no limitation placed by the scheme on the length of tenancy that can be supported by  HAP.

This will be achieved through blended delivery, involving increasing the social housing stock by over 50,000 homes, through build, acquisition and leasing programmes, and supporting some 88,000 further households through the Housing Assistance Payment and the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</p>  <p>  During the period 2016-2018, the housing needs of some 91,000 households were supported under current programmes, including the HAP and RAS schemes. This figure includes continuing to provide support to those already in homes supported under the programmes concerned, and also the additional tenancies established during that period. If the funding provided for these 91,000 households had been transferred to capital expenditure, to support building or buying homes, it would have secured some 5,500 homes, leaving no resources available to support the other 85,500 households. Almost &euro;20 billion would be required to provide a new build local authority home for those 91,000 households. </p>  <p>  In 2019, a further 22,388 households will benefit through these current funded housing delivery schemes, meaning that with the 2019 budget provision of &euro;712 million across the 3 schemes, a total of &euro;1.88 billion, over the 4 years 2016 to 2019, will have ensured that up to 112,000 families and individuals will have had their housing need met.</p>  <p>  In addition, the provision of affordable housing, either to buy or rent, is being facilitated by the &euro;310 million Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) that runs from 2019 to 2021. The fund is to provide facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites so that more affordable discounted homes can be delivered.  I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per home and, on this basis, at least 6,200 affordable homes can be provided. </p>  <p>  Two calls have been made under the Serviced Sites Fund to date, and approval in principle has been granted for funding of approximately &euro;127 million, to support almost 3,200 homes.  While more focused on urban areas, and building at scale on local authority sites, the fund remains in place for the provision of housing in all locations where there is a proven affordability challenge.  It is anticipated that further calls under the Serviced Sites Fund will be made in due course.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that in addition to these new homes being made available at a significant discount on market norms, households have also been supported through other key Government affordability initiatives.  These include, for example, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan and the Help to Buy Scheme, which have helped address the housing needs of some 15,000 households.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the actions, targets and resources available under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for meeting the range of housing needs that exist nationally.</p></reply>

The report covering the period up to end Quarter 1 of 2019 is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:  and provides project details of the social housing construction pipeline in place at that time for all local authorities, including the counties adjacent to Dublin and including new build projects contracted by local authorities and those by approved housing bodies. The Quarter 2 report will be published shortly.</p><p>The Quarter 1 report reflected an increase in the scale of the social housing build programme, with 1,416 schemes (or phases of schemes) in place, for the delivery of 20,324 homes. Of this total, 6,740 units have already been delivered under Rebuilding Ireland up to Quarter 1 of 2019, while almost 5,600 additional new homes were on site and under construction.  Almost 2,200<b></b>were at the final pre-construction stage and the remainder were progressing through the various stages of planning, design and procurement. It will be these schemes that will form the bulk of the housing starts and delivery over the next 6 months and beyond, although further projects will continue to be added to the pipeline on an ongoing basis.  </p><p>The timing, delivery and tenanting of schemes is a matter in the first place for each local authority. I am pleased to see the progress being made on projects building on what has been already delivered, but I am keen that all local authorities further accelerate their programmes and I have assured them that the necessary funding is available to support their work in this regard.</p><p>National social housing delivery targets have been set under Rebuilding Ireland out to 2021 and are publicly available on a local authority basis, on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:  .  Progress against these targets is tracked on a quarterly basis and details of this are published on my Department's website at .</p><p>The social housing delivery targets set for each local authority are in proportion to their waiting lists.  Accordingly, as progress is made by each authority against their delivery targets, this will proportionally benefit those on individual waiting lists.  The most recently available Summary of Social Housing Assessments relates to 2018 and, at national level, the number of households on the waiting list had decreased by 13,941 (-16.2%), compared to the previous assessment in June 2017, with 29 of the 31 local authorities reporting a decrease.</p></reply>

This is why the Government is committed to increasing the supply of all types of housing including social, affordable and private. Institutional investors represent one aspect of the housing market and have a role to play in increasing overall supply. Whilst the role of institutional investors has grown, particularly in the urban apartment market segment, it remains relatively minor in terms of the overall residential sector as a whole.  </p>  <p>  In overall terms, the key elements of the Government&rsquo;s approach to addressing the issues in our housing sector are set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, and Project Ireland 2040, which set out a comprehensive set of measures designed to restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium. </p>  <p>  A generally accepted convention is that housing is deemed affordable where households, particularly low or moderate income households, are paying not much more than one third of their disposable income in meeting their accommodation needs. In order to support households that have difficulty in accessing affordable housing, a multi-stranded, targeted approach is being pursued in the areas of the country most affected. The measures are targeted at low to middle income households. </p>  <p>  Some of the actions taken by Government include the trebling, to &euro;310 million, the funding available for key facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites.  This fund supports the provision of homes to purchase or rent, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF).  This fund will facilitate the development of c. 6,200 homes that will be made available to purchasers or renters at rates which have significant discounts on market prices. To date, funding of &euro;127 million has been allocated in support of 35 projects in 13 local authority areas. This funding will support the delivery of almost 3,200 homes for purchase.  Under the provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the homes that will be made available for purchase will be targeted at first time buyers. </p>  <p>  Government is also committed to rolling out a new Cost Rental model. Under Cost Rental, rents cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only.  I recently launched a development in Enniskerry Road, Dublin which is one of two &lsquo;pathfinder&rsquo; pilot projects for Cost Rental (along with the St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate site in Inchicore). Enniskerry Road will see the first units delivered with homes due to be completed for tenants in 2021. Tenants will pay &euro;1,200 per month to live in the two bedroom apartments. With the resulting rents significantly below market levels, this will provide households on moderate incomes with access to a more affordable and stable form of rental tenure than would otherwise have been the case.</p>  <p>  In terms of advancing the Cost Rental agenda, I have convened a working group within my Department, in conjunction with the Land Development Agency, the Housing Agency, and other bodies. This group is developing the policy framework for the broader Cost Rental model, to provide for a sustainable financing structure and to allow us commence delivery of units at the scale. Their work is being assisted by a research project that is being undertaken by the European Investment Bank on our behalf.</p>  <p>  The new Land Development Agency will also contribute significantly to the delivery of affordable housing and has access to a tranche of State lands, which it is estimated could provide up to 10,000 homes.  This would include 40% of the delivery being for social and affordable homes to purchase or rent.</p>  <p>  These initiatives complement other Government actions which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. While the State is playing its part in facilitating the additional supply of affordable housing, institutional investors also have a role to play in a more sustainable, long-term property system by providing much needed rental accommodation.  However, as Rebuilding Ireland makes clear, professional landlord investment can only be one aspect of a multi-pronged response to addressing current issues in the housing market.</p></reply>

The monthly report is based on data provided by housing authorities and produced through the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS).  The most recently published report, in respect of July 2019, shows that there were a total of 10,275 individuals in emergency accommodation, including 6,497 adults and 3,778 dependants (including 1,721 families).</p>  <p>  Supporting individuals and families experiencing or at risk of homelessness is a priority for the Government and for my Department in particular. Rebuilding Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, includes a range of measures that are designed to address homelessness. In 2019, the Government increased the budget available to local authorities to deliver homeless services by over 25% to &euro;146m. This funding supports the delivery of services to prevent families having to enter emergency accommodation and to ensure that those families in emergency accommodation are supported to identify and secure an independent tenancy within the shortest possible timeframe.   </p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is delivering results in supporting exits from homelessness. In 2018, 5,135 adults and their associated dependants exited homelessness into independent tenancies, an increase of over 8% on 2017.  In the first six months of 2019 2,825 adults and their dependants exited homelessness, which was a 21% increase on the numbers recorded during the corresponding period in 2018. </p>  <p>  I and my Department will continue to work proactively in partnership with local authorities and other stakeholders to ensure that homelessness is prevented as far as possible and to ensure that sustainable housing supports are provided for those individuals and families who are experiencing homelessness.</p></reply>

Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including particular structures on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS).   </p>  <p>  With regard to procedures for identifying architectural heritage, the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) was established by the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1999. Its purpose is to identify, record, and evaluate the post-1700 architectural heritage of Ireland as an aid in its protection.  </p>  <p>  As Minister, I can make recommendations to planning authorities for buildings and structures to be included on the Record of Protected Structures and these recommendations arise from the survey of the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH). Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future. However, the final decision as to inclusion of a building or structure on the RPS remains a reserved function of the relevant planning authority.  </p>  <p>  The inclusion of a structure in the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage (NIAH) Building Survey does not confer protected status on that structure.  A structure is protected only when it is included on the Record of Protected Structures (RPS) in the Development Plan or when it is included within an Architectural Conservation Area (ACA) where specific objectives and policies may apply.</p>  <p>   Any owner of a structure included in the NIAH Building Survey who may wish to carry out works to that structure should, in the first instance, contact the Architectural Conservation Officer (ACO) or equivalent planning official  in their Local Authority to confirm the status of the structure.  The ACO should be able to advise if the elected members have considered the Ministerial Recommendation or if a decision is pending.  The ACO will also be able to provide advice on what, if any implications this may have in the context of proposed works.</p></reply>

These schemes are the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Historic Structures Fund, they are administered through the local authorities and details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and on the website of individual local authorities. As these schemes are for protected built heritage structures I must inform the Deputy that the type of project referred to would not be eligible.  </p><p>I am advised that the Department of Community and Rural Development may have funding available through its Department's LEADER 2014 &ndash; 2020 Programme.  I am informed that the decision to approve a project, or otherwise, is a matter for the Local Action Group (LAG) which administers the programme in each LEADER area.  Interested applicants should, in the first instance, contact the relevant LAG through its Implementing Partner to discuss the funding that may be available. The LAG in this instance is Kerry LCDC and its Implementing Partner for the area of Kerry referred to by the Deputy is South Kerry Development Partnership Ltd.</p><p>Contact details for South Kerry Development Partnership can be found on their website at .</p></reply>

It contains a comprehensive set of actions for implementation by various bodies.</p>  <p>  The Peatland Strategy Implementation Group is a cross Departmental group which shares an independent chair with the Peatlands Council. The key purpose of the group is to drive the implementation of the vision, values and principles set out in the strategy. The group has made its first progress report to the Government on the implementation of the National Peatlands Strategy. This report has been published and is available on the website of my Department (www.chg.gov.ie).</p>  <p>  The Peatlands Council was established for the purpose of ensuring the input from all stakeholders in relation to the protection of Ireland's protected raised bogs.  </p>  <p>  The Government's Climate Action Plan 2019 (To Tackle Climate Breakdown) contains a series of actions in relation to the better management of peatlands and soils. The Plan is being overseen by a Climate Action Delivery Board within the Department of the Taoiseach, on which my Department is represented. </p></reply>
