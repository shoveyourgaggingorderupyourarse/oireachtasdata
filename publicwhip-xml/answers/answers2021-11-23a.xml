I had formal bilateral meetings with the Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and with Fijian Prime Minister, Josaia (Frank) Bainimarama.  Over the course of the Summit, I also had informal meetings and exchanges with the US President, the Prime Ministers of Iceland, India, Israel, Norway, Palau, United Kingdom, Vietnam, and many of my EU colleagues including Presidents Michel and von der Leyen.</p>  <p>  I also spoke with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, as well as First Minister Paul Givan and deputy First Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill.</p>  <p>  During my visit, I also met a delegation of researchers and students from UCC, members of the Dingle Sustainable Energy Community, and youth delegates from Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, whose attendance at COP26 is supported by Irish Aid.</p></reply>

In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in Malahide and Portmarnock school planning areas, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.   </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in these, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the school planning areas in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.   </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.  Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p></reply>

The aim of all of the Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures that have been put in place for schools is to support schools to operate safely and prevent the introduction of Covid-19 and also the onward of transmission of Covid-19 among the school community. These measures protect pupils, their parents and school staff and are very effective when adhered to. Schools are continuing to operate the infection prevention and control measures that are in place. These measure include hand hygiene, physical distancing and staying at home if you are unwell. Significant resources have been provided to schools to support this. </p>  <p>  Decisions regarding contact tracing are taken by the Department of Health and Public Health. Earlier this year NPHET recommended that routine contact tracing would cease for children under 12 with the exception of special education settings, and children over 12 where testing and tracing remains in place. </p>  <p>  It is important we continue to prioritise children&rsquo;s opportunity to avail of the social and academic opportunities which school allows. Public health teams are continuously monitoring the situation in schools, and respond to schools as necessary. As part of this monitoring, weekly epidemiological reports on COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 mass testing in schools in Ireland are published by the Health Surveillance Protection Centre. </p>  <p>  As we move through this pandemic, advice will be recommended by NPHET and the Government in terms of appropriate policy informed by both evidence and experience.  For example, the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Education working together have announced that antigen tests will be made available to children in a primary school pod, where a child in the pod is a confirmed case of COVID-19. Where two or more confirmed cases of COVID-19 occur in a class, within a seven-day period, outside of a single pod, antigen testing will be offered to the full class. The tests will be sent to the children&rsquo;s parents.</p>  <p>  School principals will not be required by the HSE to gather evidence of participation or of any antigen test results. Furthermore participation in antigen testing is not mandatory. Information materials for all parents and principals will be shared with schools and publicised directly to parents and this programme will commence shortly. Parents will be able to order these tests free of charge through a helpline operated by the HSE. </p></reply>

As with previous years, adjustments were developed in conjunction with the Leaving Certificate Exams Advisory Group.  This Group includes representation from students, parents, teachers and schools. </p><p>Details of these adjustments were issued to schools on 19 August 2021 to ensure that students and staff could familiarise themselves with any changes.  These arrangements acknowledge the disruption faced by these students because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I consider that these arrangements are proportionate to the students&rsquo; experience and loss of learning, and are educationally appropriate. The adjustments ensure that the overall structure of exams remains intact but allows for greater choice for students.  The level of adjustment will be similar to that applied by the Assessment Arrangements For Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, as announced in December 2020.</p><p>As part of the adjustments for the 2022 examinations, I also announced that an alternative set of Leaving Certificate examinations would be run in 2022, shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations.  These  examinations will be limited to certain students who are unable to sit the main set of examinations due to close family bereavement and certain other categories of serious illness to be determined, with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, which govern all aspects of the examinations system.</p><p>The State Examinations Commission will issue further details regarding the 2022 examinations, guided by prevailing public health advice. There will be further engagement with stakeholders, through the Advisory Group on Planning for the State Examinations, and with other stakeholders as appropriate, in advance of any detailed announcement.  </p></reply>

The new specification was introduced to schools in 2019 and was developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) through a Subject Development Group. Members of the Irish Agricultural Science Teachers Association (IASTA) were represented on the NCCA&rsquo;s Subject Development Group for that subject.  </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and from the NCCA met with IASTA earlier this year where some concerns of IASTA regarding the specification were discussed.  Following this meeting, IASTA later attended a meeting of an 'Agricultural Science in Practice Group' convened by the NCCA.   </p>  <p>  The purpose of the 'Agricultural Science in Practice Group' is to act as a forum that can be used to generate and collate early insights and authentic examples from practice of Agricultural Science as it is enacted in classrooms, and to publish these in an NCCA document.</p>  <p>  A further meeting of the group is due to be held before the end of 2021. </p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission (SEC) recently published an Information Note in relation to the completion of the Leaving Certificate Agricultural Science Individual Investigative Study 2022.

Discussions have been ongoing between my Department and the landowner in relation to the overall plan for the area. The landowner&rsquo;s development plans for the area have been received by my Department and a planning application is being prepared for the additional interim accommodation which the school will require for the 2022/23 academic year. The planning application for the additional interim accommodation is currently being finalised and it is anticipated that it will be submitted to the relevant local authority before the end of this month.</p>  <p>  A decision by the Local Authority on the planning application for the further interim accommodation for 2022/23 must be secured before planning can be submitted for the schools permanent accommodation.

This is the second successive Budget which has seen an improvement in allocation of teachers to primary schools. This significant increased investment reflects the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to support the educational success of learners and provide a quality inclusive school system with improved learning outcomes for all.</p>  <p>  Since Budget 2021, at primary level, the annual staffing schedule which determines the allocation of teachers to schools is now based on an average ratio of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils.  Budget 2022 has implemented a further 1 point reduction for the 2022/23 school year so that primary schools will be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of 1 classroom teacher for every 24 pupils in September 2022.  Lower thresholds apply to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools. In the current school year there are in excess of 1,500 additional teaching posts in our primary system when compared to the 2019/20 school year.</p>  <p>  At post primary level, teachers are currently allocated at a ratio of 19:1 in the free education system and 23:1 to schools in the fee charging sector. </p>  <p>  As part of COVID-19 operational supports, 1,000 additional teachers have been allocated to post-primary schools to help reduce class sizes.  A teacher allocation equivalent to a pupil teacher ratio reduction of 0.6 has been allocated to schools in the free scheme.  This allocation supports the important work of teaching and learning and provide additional teachers needed to support teacher substitution, management of physical distancing requirements by reallocating class timetables in schools to smaller groups class sizes where necessary.  These posts will also provide for management supports.  In addition an allocation, equivalent to a pupil teacher ratio reduction of 0.1 has been provided in respect of Guidance provision to support student wellbeing.</p>  <p>  Under the COVID Learning and Support Scheme (CLASS) provision was made for up to &euro;52 Million in extra teaching hours for schools. This has been put in place to help schools mitigate the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on pupil/student learning loss and wellbeing arising from the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021.  </p>  <p>  Under this programme, a block of additional teaching hours is being provided to each recognised school, from which schools can provide additional teaching support for the pupils/students who have experienced difficulties in settling back into school and engaging with learning.</p>  <p>  The extra teaching hours which are being provided are additional to 13,600 special education teachers who support the additional learning needs of pupils in mainstream primary and post primary schools.</p></reply>

This represents an increase of over 20% in funding for the DEIS programme and will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools.</p>  <p>  This year my Department will spend in the region of &euro;150million on providing supports for schools in the DEIS programme. The programme supports 884 schools and over 180,000 learners. My Department's investment includes providing for over 400 Home School Community Liaison coordinators, in the region of &euro;16million in DEIS grants, additional posts for DEIS Band 1 primary schools, curriculum supports, enhanced book grants and access to the School Completion Programme. </p>  <p>  This year's package follows an extensive body of work which has been under taken by the DEIS technical group in relation to the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools.   </p>  <p>  This work involved an initial process of consultation by my Department with the education partners on the technical aspects of the model. The purpose is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application.</p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process under DEIS Plan 2017, is based on an objective, statistics based model to determine which schools merit inclusion in the programme. An extensive body of work has been under taken by the DEIS technical group in relation to developing the refined DEIS identification. The key data sources used in the DEIS identification process are the Department of Education (DE) Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that schools are not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and that all schools will be considered under the refined model. It is also important to note that educational outcomes do not play any part in the identification of schools for inclusion in the DEIS programme either at primary or post primary level. </p>  <p>  This additional funding has been secured to allow for additional supports to be provided to those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage who are not currently in the DEIS programme and these schools will be the primary focus of my Department in relation to the extension of DEIS.</p></reply>

The teacher education support services funded by my Department provide a wide array of CPD supports to teachers and school leaders which aim to promote inclusivity and equality. These are also key elements of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum. Schools also have the option to seek bespoke school based CPD supports.</p><p>My Department provides funding for programmes of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) based on the concept of inclusive education. The areas of anti-racism, identity-based bullying and cultural awareness are addressed.  The primary focus is to enable teachers to meet the teaching and learning needs of students from all cultural backgrounds and provide support for pedagogical practices that promote inclusion. </p><p>In addition to supports provided for CPD, the Teaching Council carried out a review of the standards for programmes of ITE,<i>Initial Teacher Education: Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers. </i></p><p>Following completion of the review of the Criteria and Guidelines, the updated standards document, <i>C&eacute;im &ndash; Standards for ITE</i>was published by the Teaching Council in November 2020.  As part of this review the areas of anti-racism and diversity have been addressed.  All new programmes submitted to the Teaching Council for accreditation must now be in alignment with <i>C&eacute;im.</i>Existing programmes of ITE will be realigned in accordance with <i>C&eacute;im</i>. </p><p>The Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice (2019) acknowledges that schools provide opportunities to develop friendships and to respectfully encounter diversity and access support structures.  The policy promotes the provision of a whole-school approach to supporting wellbeing, an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health. To implement this policy, every school is required by 2025, to use the School Self-Evaluation (SSE) process to initiate a wellbeing promotion review and development cycle. To support schools in this process, a national rollout of CPD for schools is planned to commence in the current school year. </p></reply>

During the period 2021 to 2025, it is expected the School Building Programme will provide an average of 150 to 200 completed school building projects annually to provide necessary additional capacity and support the modernisation of existing school facilities.</p>  <p>  Overall my Department has a capital budget of &euro;740m in 2021 rising to &euro;1,040 in 2025. The Department of Education works within the parameters set by the Office of Government Procurement and principles of public procurement set out at both national and EU level. </p>  <p>  School building projects are progressed through the preliminary and detailed design stages of my Departments Design Team Procedures prior to proceeding to tender and construction. These stages ensure that all projects are designed against the twin benchmarks of quality and cost control. Under these procedures my Department engages with design teams to ensure that high standards in respect of both benchmarks are met. My Department constantly endeavours to progress projects through the stages of architectural planning, tender and construction in the shortest timeframes possible consistent with ensuring high quality and cost effective design.</p>  <p>  The Department has brought this to the attention of the Office of Government Procurement. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education works within the parameters set by the Office of Government Procurement and principles of public procurement set out at both national and EU level. </p>  <p>  Once contracts are awarded, any variations to the contract sum are addressed within the standard provisions of the Public Works Contracts. </p>  <p>  If and when disputes arise, those disputes would be referred to the standard dispute resolution mechanisms of the Public Works Contract &ndash; mainly Conciliation This process provides for a short (normally 42 days) timeframe within which dispute can be resolved.</p></reply>

The Department of Education engages regularly with public health experts as well as the Department of Health on these issues. </p>  <p>  Considerable measures are in place across schools to support their operation from physical distancing to enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures to mask wearing. Furthermore a communications campaign has been rolled out to remind parents of the importance of not sending their child to school if they have symptoms. </p>  <p>  As of the 27th September 2021, a decision was taken by Government in line with recommendations from NPHET to cease routine contact tracing of asymptomatic close contacts in children greater than 3 months to under 13 years outside of the household setting, including those attending primary educational and childcare settings.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with my Department has recently announced a programme in which antigen tests will be made available to children in a primary school pod, where a child in the pod is a confirmed case of COVID-19. Parents can order these from a  helpline operated by the HSE. The tests will be sent to the children&rsquo;s parents.</p>  <p>  Parents and Guardians of a primary school child, who is a confirmed case of COVID-19 following a PCR test, are asked to inform their school&rsquo;s principal. The school principal will then inform the parents of other children in the pod of a confirmed case. No personal details of the child will be shared. These parents will be provided with the option to receive free antigen tests for their child, which they will be able to order for delivery to their home.  If a child begins to experience symptoms of COVID-19 they should restrict their movements and a PCR test should be arranged. </p>  <p>  It is important that parents inform principals quickly if a child receives a PCR &lsquo;detected&rsquo; test for Covid-19. By doing this, the choice to participate in antigen testing can be offered to other parents quickly. It is important that everyone continues to follow all the public health advice in using this new programme</p>  <p>  It is not mandatory for children to participate in antigen testing. Children who are in a pod where a child has tested positive for Covid-19 can continue to attend school, whether they participate in antigen testing or not. </p>  <p>  School principals will not be required to gather evidence of participation or of any antigen test results. Information materials for parents has been shared with schools and publicised directly to parents and this programme will commence shortly. </p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department is aware of increasing local pressures and demand for post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas including school planning areas in Santry and Whitehall, Dublin 9.  </p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:</p>  <p>  -  Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place  to a number of schools in the area</p>  <p>  -  School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town/area</p>  <p>  -  Some towns/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils</p>  <p>  -  External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area</p>  <p>  My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities.  In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in Santry and Whitehall, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate further action to that already in train, including the provision of modular accommodation where necessary.</p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in this, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the school planning areas in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.   </p>  <p>  A number of capital projects have been recently completed or are currently planned or underway in the Dublin 9 area, including expansions at St. Aidan&rsquo;s CBS,, St. Kevin's College and Clonturk College. The additional capacity being provided by all of these projects is being considered in the context of the projected future requirements in the area. </p></reply>

It has adjusted its inspection programme for schools in the light of this context and is planning further adjustments. To date in the current school term, the inspection programme has been confined to essential inspection activities in the following areas: </p><p>(1) Sustaining Safe Provision of Schooling (SSPS) inspections have been undertaken to monitor the implementation of anti-Covid measures that ensure that schools are safe working and learning environments; these inspections are required under the national &quot;Work Safely Protocol COVID-19 National Protocol for Employers and Workers&quot; and reported upon regularly to the Health and Safety Authority and the Department of An Taoiseach; </p><p>(2) Child protection inspections, which monitor the implementation  of the Department&rsquo;s <i>Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools 2017</i>in fulfilment of the Minister&rsquo;s obligations under the Children First Act 2015; </p><p>(3) Inspections of schools located in Special Care Units and Child Detention Centres where educational provision is made available to children who are detained under court orders (these facilities are required to be inspected annually because of the high vulnerability of the learners concerned);  </p><p>(4) Essential follow-up inspections to monitor the implementation of urgent recommendations arising from previous child protection and other inspections; </p><p>(5) A programme of incidental (short) inspections, which are notified in advance and which in the current term have been focussed on: monitoring anti-bullying measures in schools; the use of shortened timetables for students; and the provision of advice and support to schools as they seek to address the learning needs of students whose learning has been affected by the Covid pandemic; all three of these issues have significant consequences for the learning and wellbeing of students;</p><p>(6) A small number of inspections of special education provision, focussed on monitoring how well the needs of very vulnerable learners are being addressed, particularly in the light of the impact that Covid has had on provision for children with high levels of special educational needs. </p><p>All other types of inspection (such as whole-school evaluations, curriculum evaluations, subject inspections, inspections of DEIS action planning, etc.) have been cancelled in the current term. This was notified to schools in Circulars 32/2021 and 33/2021. </p><p>In light of the evolving situation in schools concerning Covid-19 and the difficulties faced by schools in obtaining substitute teachers, the Inspectorate has decided to restrict the inspection programme further from this week. Inspections in categories (1)-(4) above, which are regarded as essential for the safety and welfare of children will continue; the programme of short inspections for the purposes of monitoring anti-bullying measures, the use of shortened timetables, and provision for learners severely affected by the pandemic will be minimised, with most inspections postponed to later in the school year. </p><p>As set out in Circulars 32/2021 and 33/2021, the inspection programme will be kept under review in the light of evolving public health advice. </p></reply>

The approach proposed is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to:</p><p>- build core social and emotional skills and competencies</p><p>- experience supportive relationships within the school setting</p><p>- be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe<i>,</i>in which they feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, that their voice is heard, and they feel supported</p><p>Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  </p><p>Embedded in the whole-school approach is the recognition that members of the school community may have different needs at different times and that a continuum of support in relation to wellbeing should be made available. </p><p>A broad range of supports, resources and professional learning opportunities are being provided to support schools to promote and support wellbeing and resilience by the Department&rsquo;s support services.  The services support schools to provide strong universal support at the level of whole school and classroom, more targeted support for some children and young people who may be at risk, and more individualised support for those with greatest need.  Support is provided to primary and post-primary school staff through the following services and supports:</p><p>- The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS)  </p><p>- Guidance Counselling service/provision  </p><p>- National Council for Special Education (NCSE)  </p><p>- Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) Wellbeing Team </p><p>- Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) Support Service</p><p>- Education Support Centres Ireland (ESCI) </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework where there is need via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p><p>NEPS, in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will a psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p><p>This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It is important to note also that under the Special Education Teacher allocation model, a NEPS assessment is not required for students to access learning supports.</p><p>The NEPS Support and Development service, reaching an estimated 25,000 teachers annually, is an applied psychological service for school staff to help build their capability to respond to the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional needs of all students, and particularly those who are experiencing barriers to their wellbeing, learning, inclusion and participation. Professional learning activities to support children/young people with social/emotional/mental health difficulties and to promote positive wellbeing in school include FRIENDS<b>:</b>Training teachers in the delivery of the FRIENDS programmes (&lsquo;Fun Friends&rsquo;, &lsquo;Friends for Life&rsquo; and &lsquo;My Friends Youth&rsquo;), which are evidence-based anxiety prevention and resilience building programmes, which foster self-concept and a sense of school belonging using Cognitive Behavioural Therapeutically-informed approaches. Friends programmes help students to develop resilience by teaching them effective strategies to cope with, problem solve and manage all kinds of emotional distress, including worry, stress, change and anxiety. Since Covid-19 the training has been adapted to Webinar format which increases accessibility for teachers.  The webinar delivery will be scaled up next year to deliver the programmes nationally to interested schools.The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme is a six-day, evidence-based programme that equips teachers to manage their classrooms effectively to prevent and reduce behavioural problems while promoting children&rsquo;s wellbeing and emotional and social competence. </p><p>NEPS has a developed a range of workshops on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the workshops are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The workshops will be available to build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. </p><p>Post primary schools will shortly receive a copy of new Student Support Team Guidelines.  A Student Support Team is a student-focused mechanism put in place by a school in order to co-ordinate the support available for students in the school and to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services. NEPS provides support to post primary schools in the setting up or review of Student Support Teams. </p><p>Also at post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. Guidance allocations for all schools were increased in the 2020/21 school year. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  </p><p>My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  </p></reply>

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.</p>  <p>  This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.  </p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 will see six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme.</p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme builds on significant investment by the Department of Education in energy efficiency through the 2009/10 Cavity and Attic Insulation/Water Conservation Scheme and ongoing Summer Works and refurbishment projects.</p>  <p>  The upgrades target a Building Energy Rating of B, 50% energy efficiency improvement and 50% emissions reduction. The works typically involves upgrades to the building fabric including wall and roof insulation, doors and windows, air tightness improvements, LED lighting and heating upgrades as well as renewable technologies.</p>  <p>  The general principles and approach to school selection include schools meeting Energy Monitoring and Reporting requirements and demonstrating a strong and holistic commitment to energy management practices through participation in the Energy in Education Programme. The programme selection also seeks to enable various cross sections of school types and sizes, energy consumption profiles and different elements of construction type and heritage/ conservation requirements where specific learnings are being targeted. The pathfinder programme is thus delivered on broad assessment in line with the above considerations and not on an invitation basis. </p></reply>

In accordance with Department Circulars 0044/2019 and 31/2011, schools are required to employ appropriately qualified and registered teachers and ensure that unemployed teachers should be offered employment in preference to those who have retired.

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department previously fully implemented and funded the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator for a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim and officials from the Department and school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the issues. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September, there has been significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale within education and training boards on a pro rata basis with an effective date of implementation for these new pay arrangements of 1st  September 2021. Pay rates will be pro rata according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The assimilation of School Secretaries to the CO Grade III pay scale will require further dialogue between the parties and further engagement is taking place at present to allow this to be finalised.  My Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff and engagement has begun on this element.</p>  <p>  Discussions on these elements continue at present and should agreement on an overall package be reached then Forsa would have to ballot their members and an implementation process would then begin if the ballot was passed. Therefore actual implementation and payment of any agreed pay improvements is still some time away. However, as set out above, the pay element of the offer includes an effective implementation date of 1 September 2021 should agreement be reached.</p>  <p>  I welcomed the deferral of the action scheduled for Wednesday 15th September and I encourage all parties to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

This new investment is required to meet the needs of students with special educational needs enrolled in mainstream classes; students to be enrolled in new special classes and new special school places and the needs of new and developing schools.  There are predetermined levels of teaching and SNA support for both special classes and special schools. </p>  <p>  A new model for allocating special education teachers in respect of students with special needs enrolled in mainstream classes was introduced in 2017.  The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.  The profile of each school takes account of enrolments and a number of other factors that are considered to be indicative of the level of need in each school. There is a commitment to update profiles on a regular basis with the last update being for the 2019/20 school.  </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a provision for schools to seek additionality through the Exceptional Needs Review process if there is a significant change in their level of need in between profile updates. </p>  <p>  The allocation of the additional teaching support for students with special educational needs in mainstream classes is a matter for each school and guidelines have been provided in this regard.</p>  <p>  In relation to SNA support for students in mainstream classes, schools receive an allocation based on overall care need in the school.  It is then a matter for each school to allocate this resource following the principle that those with greatest need should receive the most support.</p>  <p>  There is also provision for schools to seek additionality in respect of the SNA allocation where circumstances have changed significantly.</p></reply>

In the 2020/21 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.  </p>  <p>  Planning for school transport scheme services for the 2021/22 school year proceeded on the basis that the public health measures in place as schools closed at the end of the last school year would remain as the term began in this new school year. This included the operation of post-primary services at 50% capacity, in addition to hygiene measures and the wearing of masks on-board.  The Department has kept this position under review as the vaccination programme for children on post-primary services was rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeded. </p>  <p>  In line with the lifting of restrictions on public transport, and with effect from the return of schools following the October mid-term break, implementation commenced for post-primary school transport services to resume operating at 100% capacity.  This process will take a period of time to re-organise and re-schedule services and communications will be issued to families regarding any revised arrangements.  </p>  <p>  With regard to post-primary special needs transport services, the Department will work with schools on a case by case basis where such services may be required to continue operating at 50% capacity.</p>  <p>  Any pupil who has been issued a ticket for this school year will retain their ticket for the year.  Where additional vehicles that were provided for social distancing purposes are removed and when all services resume operating at 100% capacity, any spare capacity available will  be offered on those services to concessionary pupils or late applicants where such capacity exists. </p>  <p>  All other measures relating to hygiene, pre-assigned seating, cleaning and the wearing of masks by post-primary students will remain in place subject to further review. </p></reply>

The NCCA engaged closely with stakeholders and in response to their requests, the NCCA extended the timeframe for the consultation from the end of August in order to facilitate greater stakeholder engagement in the process.

The objective of the review was to examine aspects of career guidance in the Irish education and training system in order to improve the existing career guidance tools and information and to enhance engagement with enterprise.  The review was published in April 2019 and contained 18 recommendations.</p><p>On publication, an internal Taskforce was created, however the work of the Taskforce was impacted significantly in 2020 due to the response required to the COVID pandemic in respect of continuity of education.  It was also impacted by the establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (D.FHERIS), as the recommendations contained in the report span both Departments. </p><p>The Taskforce through their deliberations identified two main streams of work arising from the recommendations:</p><p>- Provision of high quality information, data and education and career guidance support to learners. </p><p>- An overarching policy function in relation to guidance.</p><p>In order to progress implementation of the Indecon recommendations, both Departments have agreed that each will take responsibility for responding to the recommendations that relate to their respective mandate.  It has also been agreed that the Internal Taskforce would be dissolved and that a High Level Interdepartmental Steering Group would be established to oversee implementation. </p><p>The Department of Education is focused on the overarching policy function in relation to guidance. Proposals are in draft form for the establishment of appropriate structures to support this work including various inter-departmental Guidance policy working groups and subcommittee groups to consider how best to implement the recommendations including the development of a coherent, long term strategy for life-long guidance.</p><p>Since the publication of the Indecon report, the Department of Education has begun to make progress on some of the recommendations in collaboration with other relevant sections of the Department.  We have also been carrying out some background research and gathering baseline data to support the development of the strategy for life-long guidance.  This includes current data regarding guidance allocations at post-primary, numbers of guidance counsellors attending Department funded counselling supervision, numbers of teachers applying to train as guidance counsellors, and guidance counsellor supply and qualification issues.  The Department is also considering the current process for recognition of guidance counselling qualifications to work in schools and possible future needs for a &ldquo;competent authority&rdquo; to consider equivalent qualifications.</p><p>Work is underway in relation to the Inclusion recommendations related to young people with Special Educational Needs (SEN) and those most in need of guidance from under-represented groups. A number of officials from relevant areas of the Department are working closely with the National Disability Authority and the National Council for Special Education.  Some collaborative work has also been undertaken in partnership with the professional bodies on labour market information for example the delivery of a training webinar for Guidance Counsellors in relation to Computer Science education, training and career pathways.</p><p>The Department has recently established a working group, comprising the Directors of Studies from the Higher Education Institutions who provide the Guidance Counselling programmes recognised by the Department for those working as Guidance Counsellors in Post Primary Schools.  The purpose of this working group will be to consider guidance counselling post-graduate training under the inclusion/ SEN umbrella.  This group plans to hold its first meeting in early January.</p><p>The Department has also had discussions with the National Centre for Guidance in Education (NCGE) about the potential to extend relevant parts of their webinar series to further address the Inclusion/SEN in guidance training for guidance counsellors.</p><p>The Department is supporting Dublin City University on its proposal to provide an outreach programme in Guidance Counselling in the South East region where the supply of Guidance Counsellors has been identified as an issue.  This programme previously ran very successfully in the North West (Sligo).  We expect this programme will commence in September 2022 and will provide an additional 20 -25 Guidance Counsellors into the school system.</p><p>Department officials also met with officials in DFHERIS - who are leading on the recommendations related to the provision of high quality information, data and education and career guidance support to learners, to share ideas and discuss future development of the recently launched career information portal The Right Course: </p></reply>

These measures protect students, their parents and school staff and are very effective.</p>  <p>  Public Health continue to advise that the two most important actions to prevent the introduction and spread of Covid-19 (and other respiratory viruses), is by ensuring no-one with new onset symptoms attend school, and that all recommended infection prevention and control measures are in place in line with school Covid response plans.  </p>  <p>  Each school was provided with an updated COVID-19 Response Plan in advance of the return to school.  Significant additional resources of &euro;639m were put into schools in the last academic year to keep schools safe.  </p>  <p>  Further funding of &euro;57.6 million has been paid by way of Covid-19 capitation to schools in September for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures for this term. This funding will cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures, PPE requirements, enhanced cleaning supports and supervision. </p>  <p>  At primary level, additional management resources for principal release days were provided for Principals and Deputy Principals. Teacher Supply panels were also expanded to cover the majority of primary schools nationwide, and a recent review saw an additional 100 teaching posts added resulting in approximately 480 teaching posts on these panels available to provide substitute cover in schools. </p>  <p>  At post primary level over 1000 teaching posts were provided to support social distancing within classrooms, to provide for enhanced supervision arrangements in order to manage and prevent congregation of large groups of students and ensure the careful movement in a socially distant manner to classes for specialist subjects where it is neither practical nor possible to remain in the classroom. This funding also included additional posts for guidance provision.</p>  <p>Managing ventilation is also an important part of the measures to keep our schools safe. Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The Departments guidance is clear that where the recommended measures have been undertaken, and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available. The guidance outlines that Carbon Dioxide (CO2  ) monitors, which were provided to schools, can play a part in providing a useful general indication that rooms may not be adequately ventilated. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with my Department has recently announced a programme in which antigen tests will be made available to children in a primary school pod, where a child in the pod is a confirmed case of COVID-19. The tests will be sent to the children&rsquo;s parents.</p>  <p>  Parents and Guardians of a primary school child, who is a confirmed case of COVID-19 following a PCR test, are asked to inform their school&rsquo;s principal. The school principal will then inform the parents of other children in the pod of a confirmed case. No personal details of the child will be shared. These parents will be provided with the option to receive free antigen tests for their child, which they will be able to order for delivery to their home.  </p></reply>

The NCCA&rsquo;s Advisory Report on the Senior Cycle has been submitted to my Department for consideration. The review involved a very broad range of research, consultations and communications with a wide range of stakeholders, including students, on all aspects of review and redevelopment over a number of phases over the period of the review.</p>  <p>  The Advisory Report maps out, in broad terms, an ambitious programme of work, which would enable the development and construction of the components that would make up a Framework for Senior Cycle and will involve further ongoing stakeholder engagement and consultation. </p>  <p>  I and my Department officials are also aware of the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our education system over the past two years, including its impact on students who were due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in those years.  I expect that the lessons to be learnt from the pandemic will be considered and where appropriate, will assist in informing the redevelopment of Senior Cycle.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the desire in the education community and more generally that the NCCA Advisory Report be published but we must first complete our consideration of the Report. I am currently focusing on what the implementation of the Report would involve and what we can do to best ensure the further evolution of Senior Cycle.  </p></reply>

One of these measures is that household close contacts who are fully vaccinated and showing no symptoms should now restrict their movements until they have 3 negative antigen test results within 5 days. </p><p>A range of measures are in place to provide enhanced substitute cover in the context of current challenges arising from the Covid-19 emergency.</p><p>These include a major expansion of the primary substitute teacher supply panels, which now employ almost 380 teachers and provide substitute cover to over 2,500 primary schools across the country. A review of the supply panels has taken place and approximately 100 additional teachers are being added to existing/new areas where significant challenges have been demonstrated in sourcing substitution.  Posts have been allocated to the base schools to allow arrangements for the recruitment of these additional staff.</p><p>The supply panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as the national substitution portal service <i>Sub Seeker</i>, operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and developed in accordance with my Department's Teacher Supply Action Plan. Schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed.  </p><p>In addition to the expansion of the supply panels, schools with teaching principals have also been asked to cluster their allocation of principal release days to form a full-time fixed-term post to minimise the requirement for substitute teachers.</p><p>For the current school year, changes have been made to the career break scheme to permit teachers on career break to carry out unlimited substitute work. Changes have also been made to the job sharing scheme to permit job sharing teachers carry out substitute work on the days they are rostered off, in their own or in other schools. </p><p>The Teaching Council has undertaken a communications campaign to contact the over 111,000 teachers on its register to raise awareness to the current teacher substitute challenges and to ask available teachers to register with<i>Sub Seeker,</i>so that their availability is known to schools seeking subs.</p><p>The Council and my Department have also engaged with higher education institutions, who have been requested to bring flexibility to programme delivery to enhance the availability of PME student teachers to undertake substitute work. PME students have also been advised to register with the Teaching Council and to register with <i>Sub Seeker</i>.</p><p>My Department will continue its engagement with education stakeholders to identify solutions to the current challenges in recruiting substitute teachers.</p></reply>

In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in Dublin mid-west, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate further action to that already in train.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in this, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p><p>The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the school planning areas in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.  Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can be found on my Department's website at and this information is also updated regularly.</p></reply>

The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health.</p>  <p>  This review of the Action Plan on Bullying and the Anti-bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools will involve significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and will also involve consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students.</p>  <p>  There are currently extensive training and curricular supports, including through the Social Personal Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the Webwise Programme, to assist schools in the development of policies and practices on the safe use of the internet and on the prevention of bullying including cyber-bullying. </p>  <p>  The PDST and its Webwise team have developed dedicated resources for teachers, parents, children and young people which gives practical information and advice on the safe, ethical and responsible use of the internet and addresses key issues such as cyberbullying, sexting, image sharing, respectful communication, social media, popular apps and more. The Webwise resources are available at www.webwise.ie. </p>  <p>  The Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 also promotes the development of digital literacy in our young people and the importance of respectful online communications. A new digital strategy is under development with planned publication early next year. Online safety will be an important feature of the new strategy.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate is currently prioritising monitoring and gathering information about the implementation of anti-bullying measures in schools. As part of this work, the Inspectorate will also identify and report on examples of effective practice in relation to preventing and tacking bullying in schools. This will help provide evidence of the type of bullying that is occurring in our schools and examples of approaches that can be successful in dealing with it. An important part of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s work will be a focus on the priority actions of schools in relation to promoting a positive school culture and climate.</p></reply>

The immediate focus of the work is on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of the Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum. This work is progressing well and with sections of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE Junior Cycle Short Course and Senior Cycle SPHE Framework). The Council has been collaborating with the PDST, Junior Cycle for Teachers and the Health Service Executive to see how these resources can be used to support CPD provision in this area.

Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary Junior Cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to Senior Cycle. </p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  Schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the NCCA to best give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to develop inclusive and age-appropriate RSE and SPHE curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships. The work of the NCCA draws on its report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools, which was published in December 2019. Arising from recommendations in that report the NCCA has been publishing online learning resources to support teaching and learning linked to the current SPHE/RSE curriculum in schools. The resources in this online toolkit include guidance on how to create a more inclusive classroom. As well as these updated online learning resources the NCCA has recently begun work on draft Junior Cycle SPHE specifications. It is expected that a revised specification will be completed by the end of 2022, following a period of public consultation. This will be followed by the redevelopment of the Senior Cycle and Primary curricula.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the NCCA to determine the approach to best give effect to the commitment regarding SPHE and RSE in the Programme for Government. Should any legislative changes be required in this context I am committed to making such changes.</p></reply>

A review of the supply panels has taken place and approximately 100 additional teachers are being added to existing/new areas where significant challenges have been demonstrated in sourcing substitution.  Posts have been allocated to the base schools to allow arrangements for the recruitment of these additional staff.</p><p>The supply panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as the national substitution portal service <i>Sub Seeker</i>, operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and developed in accordance with my Department's Teacher Supply Action Plan. Schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed.  </p><p>In addition to the expansion of the supply panels, schools with teaching principals have also been asked to cluster their allocation of principal release days to form a full-time fixed-term post to minimise the requirement for substitute teachers.</p><p>For the current school year, changes have been made to the career break scheme to permit teachers on career break to carry out unlimited substitute work. Changes have also been made to the job sharing scheme to permit job sharing teachers carry out substitute work on the days they are rostered off, in their own or in other schools. </p><p>The Teaching Council has undertaken a communications campaign to contact the over 111,000 teachers on its register to raise awareness to the current teacher substitute challenges and to ask available teachers to register with<i>Sub Seeker,</i>so that their availability is known to schools seeking subs.</p><p>The Council and my Department have also engaged with higher education institutions, who have been requested to bring flexibility to programme delivery to enhance the availability of PME student teachers to undertake substitute work.

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department previously fully implemented and funded the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator for a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim and officials from the Department and school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the issues. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September, there has been significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale within education and training boards on a pro rata basis with an effective date of implementation for these new pay arrangements of 1st September 2021. Pay rates will be pro rata according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The assimilation of School Secretaries to the CO Grade III pay scale will require further dialogue between the parties and further engagement is taking place at present to allow this to be finalised.  My Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff and engagement has begun on this element.</p>  <p>  While there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. When the final package for secretaries has been agreed and an implementation plan in place for schools and DE, that intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p>  <p>  I welcomed the deferral of the action scheduled for Wednesday 15th September and I encourage all parties to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately.  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  </p>  <p>  In June 2021, as part of phase 1 of the review, the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report on eligibility with an examination of issues for mainstream pupils relating to the nearest and next nearest school.  Following consideration of this report, measures were approved which allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who are otherwise eligible for school transport but are attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time.  This arrangement is in place for the current school year pending completion of the full review of the School Transport Scheme</p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is now underway. The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses, with a view to presenting a final report with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme. </p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. </p>  <p>  A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. </p>  <p>  The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p>  <p>The guidance outlines that Carbon Dioxide (CO2  ) monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. </p>  <p>  In excess of 35,400 monitors were delivered to schools nationwide at a cost of circa &euro;4 million. </p>  <p>  A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department.</p>  <p>  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.  </p>  <p>  Where the above measures have been undertaken, and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available. There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. If, following consultation with a supplier a school feels that its individual space may require specific technical specialist advice then the assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect can be sought.</p></reply>

When schools are providing their annual 30 September enrolment returns to the Department in respect of the Primary On-line Database (POD) for primary schools and Post-Primary On-line Database (PPOD) for post-primary schools, they are now also requested to provide information in respect of overall demand for school places and available capacity within their schools.

My Department is currently working to secure a site for the school's new permanent building.</p><p>My Department also has building projects at primary, post primary and special schools in Galway City, including:</p><p>- A new school building for St. Joseph's College </p><p>- A major extension at Col&aacute;iste Mhuire M&aacute;thair </p><p>- New school buildings for Scoil Caitriona Junior and Senior Schools</p><p>- A new school building for Cuan na Gaillimhe CNS</p><p>- A new school building for Rosedale Special School </p><p>My Department is aware of vacant former school properties in Galway City, and of properties which may become vacant as a result of school building projects.  These properties are in the ownership of third-parties, but in all instances across the country, such properties are considered as part of my Department's assessment of potential solutions for school accommodation needs and my Department engages with the relevant property owners as appropriate.</p><p>This multi-faceted approach enhances my Department&rsquo;s capacity to plan the provision of essential school places across all school planning areas including Galway city. </p></reply>

This represents an increase of over 20% in funding for the DEIS programme and will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools.</p>  <p>  This package follows an extensive body of work which has been under taken by the DEIS technical group in relation to the development of a model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools. The refined model is an objective, statistics based process, based on school enrolment data and data available from Census 2016 under the HP Deprivation Index.  </p>  <p>  This work involved an initial process of consultation by my Department with the education partners on the technical aspects of the model. Over the coming weeks, there will be further consultation with relevant stakeholders to outline the components of the model. The purpose is to ensure that, as far as possible, the refined DEIS identification model can provide an objective and independent means of identifying schools serving high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and also to ensure there is a full understanding of the refined model and its potential application.</p></reply>

In the 2020/21 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.  </p>  <p>  All children who are eligible and who completed the application and payment process on time for the 2021/22 school year are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  </p>  <p>  Planning for school transport scheme services for the 2021/22 school year proceeded on the basis that the public health measures in place as schools closed at the end of the last school year would remain as the term began in this new school year. This included the operation of post-primary services at 50% capacity, in addition to hygiene measures and the wearing of masks on-board.  The Department has kept this position under review as the vaccination programme for children on post-primary services was rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeded. </p>  <p>  In line with the lifting of restrictions on public transport, and with effect from the return of schools following the October mid-term break, implementation commenced for post-primary school transport services to resume operating at 100% capacity.  This process will take a period of time to re-organise and re-schedule services and communications will be issued to families regarding any revised arrangements.  </p>  <p>  With regard to post-primary special needs transport services, the Department will work with schools on a case by case basis where such services may be required to continue operating at 50% capacity.</p>  <p>  Any pupil who has been issued a ticket for this school year will retain their ticket for the year.

They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. </p><p>A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation.

This service, with responsibility for supporting the implementation of RSE in primary and post-primary schools nationally, was set up in October 1995. The resources were based on the interim curriculum and guidelines for Relationships and Sexuality Education developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). </p><p>In April 2018, the then Minister for Education and Skills Mr. Richard Bruton T.D. asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a major review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland. The NCCA advises the Department and Minister in relation to the curriculum to be taught in schools.</p><p>The <i>Final Report on the Review of RSE in Primary and Post-primary Schools</i>was published by the NCCA in December, 2019. </p><p>Following on from the publication of this report, the NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. The immediate focus of the work is on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of the Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum. This work is progressing well including sections of the toolkit (a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the Primary SPHE Curriculum, the SPHE Junior Cycle Short Course and Senior Cycle SPHE Framework). </p><p>The resources are no longer used in continuing professional development (CPD) training which the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) provides to teachers, and clearly do not reflect the inclusive standards and ethos which the education system seeks to uphold.  The team of advisors and associates involved in RSE CPD were instructed prior to the beginning of the current school year that the resources in question were not to be referenced, promoted or advocated and that at every juncture teachers should be directed to the new resources in the NCCA toolkits. The NCCA resources section has been superseded by resource portals which can be found at and on the NCCA SPHE toolkits at . The Council has been collaborating with the PDST, Junior Cycle for Teachers and the Health Service Executive to see how these resources can be used to support CPD provision in this area. </p><p>All interested parties, including the Department will endeavour to ensure that resources for teachers are reviewed on an ongoing basis so that they are kept relevant, aligned with the curriculum and meet teachers' and students' needs in today's world.</p></reply>

The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports</p>  <p>  This policy is supported by significant investment by this Government.

I should also clarify that the NCSE does not maintain waiting lists for schools.  Boards of management of individual schools are responsible for such enrolment matters.</p>  <p>  However, the NCSE, through its local network of SENOs (Special Educational Needs Organisers), offers advice and support to parents on the possible placement options available to their child, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement and special school placement.</p>  <p>  NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need.

This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population. The total Department spend on DEIS in 2021 is over &euro;150 million, which includes over &euro;26 million for the School Completion Programme (SCP). </p><p>The full list of supports to DEIS schools is available at: </p><p>Budget 2022 has allocated the largest-ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme, providing for an additional allocation of &euro;18 million in 2022 (&euro;32 million over a full year) which will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools. </p><p>This means that by 2023 the Irish Government will target over &euro;180 million at addressing educational disadvantage through the DEIS programme, an increase of 20% on the 2021 allocation.</p><p>The continuum of education is supported through a range of dedicated supports in line with the needs of the child.  These supports include the provision of teachers, special needs assistants and psychological support from the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) available in DEIS and non DEIS schools.</p><p>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) through the provision of school-based psychological services, supports the wellbeing, academic, social and emotional development of children in primary and post-primary schools. </p><p>All mainstream schools receive additional allocations of Special Education Teaching (SET) support based on the profiled needs of the school. The SET allocation model provides a single unified allocation for special educational teaching support to schools, based on a school&rsquo;s educational profile. It allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support and to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs. It gives flexibility to schools in deploying their resources.  They can take account of the actual learning needs of pupils rather than being guided primarily by a particular diagnosis of disability. The Department of Education has published guidelines for schools as to how they should deploy their resources. </p><p>In September, I announced a Covid Learning and Support Scheme (CLASS) has been put in place to help schools mitigate the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on pupil/student learning loss and wellbeing arising from the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021.  Provision is being made for up to &euro;52 Million in extra teaching hours for schools during the current school year.  </p><p>Under the programme, a block of additional teaching hours is being provided to each recognised school.  Schools may use the additional teaching hours in accordance with the needs of their students.

The aim of all of the Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures that have been put in place for schools is to support schools to operate safely and prevent the introduction of Covid-19 and also the onward of transmission of Covid-19 among the school community. These measures protect pupils, their parents and school staff and are very effective when adhered to.</p>  <p>  At the request of NPHET, the Health Information and Quality Authority examined whether there should a reduction in the minimum age for the wearing of face masks.  In its report published on 20 September, it has recommended that there should be no reduction in the minimum age with respect to the use of face masks. It is intended that this recommendation would be kept under review by HIQA.</p></reply>

There are over 250,000 companies on the register of which approximately 25% have an annual return filing deadline of the 25th of November.

There is limited discretion however, as the Registrar cannot apply flexibility on a case-by-case basis, so when an extension to a deadline is put in place, it applies broadly.</p>  <p>  The Registrar is mindful of the particular problems being raised by some small accountancy firms, as well as the limitations placed on her by the Companies Act in taking a case by case approach.  The Registrar has consulted with stakeholders to canvass their views on the matter, and they were broadly supportive of the need for a short extension to the filing deadline. I am informed that the Registrar has made the decision to extend Thursday&rsquo;s filing deadline for a period of two weeks in order to facilitate those firms who have found themselves in serious difficulties. I am also advised that this short extension to the filing deadline will not unduly impact on the proposed update of the CRO&rsquo;s IT system which will introduce enhancements.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention.    I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 12 November, over 277,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed or have surveys underway and over 125,000 premises have build currently underway. NBI has also advised that the first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan and over 30,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 12 counties. I understand that in County Louth surveying is complete in the Deployment Area of Riverstown and main build works are under way in the Deployment Areas of Drogheda and Dundalk with some 2,300 premises now available for order or pre order in the Dundalk area.</p>  <p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Louth through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. However, the primary focus must be on addressing the delays which have arisen and ensuring that the National Broadband Ireland build programme gets back on track and is building momentum month on month.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 12 November, 389 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Killanny GAA Club, Port Beach, Templetown Beach, Annaghminnan Rovers GAA Club, Stephenstown Pond Nature Park (6.9km from premises referred to), Clogherhead, and Mattock Rangers GAA Club. Further details can be found at www.nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Walshestown National School and Saint Enda's National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at www.nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

In this regard, a Dublin City Council led pilot campaign,  #CircleCity, was launched in October 2020 with the aim of building a culture of on-the-go recycling, with 25 recycling bins being installed on Grafton Street and Henry Street during the first phase of the campaign.Initial audits carried out on the performance of this first phase have so far reported positive results. The most recent audit found that 83% of plastic bottles and cans in the areas covered by the recycling initiative are now ending up in the recycling bins, as opposed to the general waste. The overall quantity of plastic bottles and cans being recycled through the new bins has more than doubled since launch and it is expected that 48,180 plastic bottles and 38,870 cans which would otherwise end up in landfill will be recycled each year.</p><p>The second phase of the Dublin City Council #CircleCity campaign has recently been launched which will double the number of recycling bins installed along busy streets in Dublin city centre and allow expansion into other areas including St. Andrew&rsquo;s Street.  <i></i></p><p>When completed, the results of this pilot campaign will provide valuable insights and help inform the ongoing engagement between my Department and the local authority sector on how best to deliver on this commitment nationally.</p></reply>

Such licences are also entirely permissive in nature, confer no fishing rights on the licensee, are not the property of the holder and cannot be held on a permanent basis. Therefore no licences are retained as they expire at the end of the year of issue including after the introduction of the Hardship Scheme. In addition, licences were not relinquished under the Hardship Scheme but, as part of the conditions of payment, payees undertook not to apply for an annual commercial salmon licence post the scheme. The number of annual public commercial salmon fishing licences issued for 2021 is 79.</p>  <p>  The scheme closed in 2008 with all funds expended.  There are currently no plans to introduce a similar scheme. I have no function in the matter of pensions. </p>  <p>  In order to comply with the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive and the principles of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO), Ireland manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis.  </p>  <p>Rivers, where a commercial fishery has existed, are open to commercial harvest in any year only where the individual river is sufficiently exceeding its conservation limit (CL) so that there is a sustainable harvestable surplus available based on the annual reviews .  Estuaries are open only where all contributing rivers sufficiently exceed their individual CL to avoid indiscriminate commercial exploitation of the mixed stock within the estuary.  Rivers below their CL are closed to all harvest (commercial or rod) in line with the conservation imperative.  The latest analysis for 2021 along with that for previous years is available at the following link :Technical Expert Group on Salmon | TEGOS | Inland Fisheries Ireland  .</p>  <p>  Since 2007, commercial harvest of salmon at sea has been ceased by Government decision. Commercial fishing for salmon at sea targets multiple stocks from rivers in Ireland and other European countries. These stocks cannot be disaggregated at sea and such harvest is indiscriminate in targeting vulnerable or endangered stocks within the mix of stocks and is inconsistent with the EU Habitats Directive. Following the Government decision in 2006, a &euro;25m Hardship Scheme was established which was open to all holders of a commercial salmon licence. The Hardship Scheme predated the establishment of IFI and was administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM).  I understand that 1,046 fishermen availed of the scheme.  </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The levy funds support schemes designed to facilitate national electricity policy objectives for renewable electricity. The PSO is a vital policy support for the development of renewable electricity and to enable Ireland reach EU renewable energy targets and national energy and climate targets.The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Public Service Obligations Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002). Under this legislation, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), the independent electricity and gas regulator, is assigned responsibility for the calculation of the levy each year and the calculation of the Levy is strictly a CRU matter.</p><p>The CRU published its annual decision on the amount of the PSO for 2020/2021 in July and it is available at www.cru.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CRU20086-PSO-Decision-Paper-2020-21.pdf. This describes the calculation of the total PSO and customer charge, including the CRU&rsquo;s use of the ESB Networks&rsquo; 2020/21 PSO Cost Allocation Model for the purposes of determining the levy charge attributable to each customer category under the method in the legislation. </p><p>Under the Electricity Regulation Act, the CRU is directly responsible for the performance of its functions to a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas, and not to me as Minister. The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provide a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions on matters such as the CRU PSO calculation, directly to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention. </p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 12 November, over 277,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed or have surveys underway and over 125,000 premises have build currently underway. NBI has also advised that the first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan and over 30,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 12 counties. In County Cork surveys are complete in the Deployment Areas of Templemartin, Tallow and Kanturk, main build works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Midleton and Youghal and build is complete in the Deployment Area of Carrigaline, with 4,504 premises now available for order in Carrigaline and the surrounding areas including Douglas, Lehenagh, Ballygarvan and Liscleary.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 12 November, 389 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Ballydaly Community Hall, Aubane Community Centre, Laharn Heritage Centre, Mealagh Valley Community Centre, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, Courtbrack Community Centre, Ionadh &Aacute;ise, Lissavard Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre, Ballindangan Community Centre, Bere Island Heritage Centre, Col&aacute;iste Phobal Cl&eacute;ire, Castlelyons Community Centre, The Old Schoolhouse, Sherkin Island Community Hall, T.O. Park Labbamollaga, Clogagh Community Hall and Glash Community Centre. Further details can be found at www.nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>Templebrady National School, Ballycroneen National School, Clogagh National School, Educate Together Carrigaline, Ringaskiddy Lower Harbour National School,   Scoil Naomh Fion&aacute;n Na Reanna, Ballygarvan National School and Shanbally National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at www.nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

This plan sets out indicative ranges of emissions reductions for all sectors of the economy. It also sets out the practical policies and measures that we need to take to meet our climate targets. A call for expert evidence was conducted during the preparation of the Climate Action Plan asking climate scientists, experts and industry to share their data-based, technical proposals to support the development of the plan. Over 200 responses were received in relation to this strand, including from the Irish Peatland Conservation Council. The Climate Action Plan recognises the importance of our peatlands to deliver a range of climate benefits. </p><p>Actions to deliver this potential include:- Restoring and rewetting raised bog Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs), as set out in the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, undertaken by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Such restoration measures, and hydrological management of our protected peatlands, will halt and reduce peat oxidation and carbon loss.</p><p>- Undertaking further research to assess the potential to sequester, store and reduce emissions of carbon through the management, restoration and rehabilitation of peatlands, as outlined in the National Peatlands Strategy.</p><p>- Upgrading land-use and habitat mapping systems to establish the baseline condition of wetlands, and inform the development of best-practice guidelines for wetland management, including the management of degraded sites and peatlands currently exploited for energy peat extraction.</p><p>- Developing further measures to help rehabilitate exploited and degraded peatlands, including as part of national land-use planning and the new Common Agricultural Policy, and recognising that strategies may need to differ between regions.</p></reply>

These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with the Department of Finance and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in relation to the development of a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme. This project has been selected for inclusion in Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan and will be co-funded by the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility and Exchequer funding. Discussions with the European Investment Bank about their participation in the scheme are also underway. The target for introduction of the scheme is mid-2022.</p>  <p>  The loan guarantee will provide risk protection to retail credit institutions participating in the scheme. This will enable credit institutions to offer loans with reduced interest rates and make comprehensive home energy efficiency upgrades more affordable to consumers. As a result, households will be able to enjoy more comfortable and healthier homes with a lower carbon footprint.</p>  <p>  The loan guarantee is expected to help increase the volume of retrofit activity within the State and improve the recovery and resilience of the supply chain within the retrofit sector. The scheme will also signal to the banking sector new viable business opportunities associated with the transition to a low carbon economy.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention. </p>  <p>  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.  </p>  <p>  I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that, as of 12 November, over 277,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed or have surveys underway and over 125,000 premises have build currently underway. NBI has also advised that the first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan and over 30,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 12 counties. In County Tipperary, surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Cashel, Nenagh and Mullinamore and main build works are under way in the Deployment Areas of Tipperary, Roscrea and Clonmel. There are over 380 premises in Tipperary that can order or pre-order today in areas around Drumwood, Donohill, Oola and Monard.  </p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Tipperary through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range. Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. </p>  <p>  In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. </p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 12 November, 389 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. BCP&rsquo;s are installed at Moyglass Community Hall, The Pavillion/Ballinderry Sportsfield, Drom Community Centre, Boher Parish Hall, Rossmore Community Hall, Aglish Community Hall, Killoscully Community Centre, Curreeney Community Hall, Pairc Na Ngael/Kilcoleman, Latteragh Community Centre, Lismackin Community Hall, Killurney Community Centre, Ballinahinch Community Centre, The Apple Farm/ The Apple Camping &amp;amp; Caravan Park, Fanure Community Hall and Killea GAA Club. Further details can be found at www.nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  Ballinahinch National School, Leugh National School, Killea National School, Killeen National School and Poulacapple National School have been installed by NBI for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  Further details are available on the NBI website at www.nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p></reply>

Since 2000, over 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country. This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier and cheaper to heat and light.   Some &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes, including the Solar PV scheme and the Building Energy Rating programme.  This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes. Over 11,000 retrofits received SEAI support to end-October this year. It is important to note that extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity in the residential sector between January and mid-April as well as subsequent challenges in the supply chain have had a significant impact on activity. Residential retrofit is also a major focus of the funding provided in the National Development Plan Review. &euro;5 billion of the expected &euro;9.5 billion in additional carbon tax receipts will be invested in energy efficiency and will underpin the National Retrofit Plan.</p>  <p>  In addition to the schemes operated by the SEAI, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage funds the Local Authority Retrofit Scheme. In 2021, &euro;65 million was allocated for this scheme. </p></reply>

By year end, this will represent almost a doubling of supports to EVs in 2020.</p>  <p>  As a result, the EV percentage of overall car registrations has increased significantly this year and represented over 15% to end Q3 2021. Government is on track as regards the number of vehicles which need to be sold in 2021 to reach its projected annual EV target as set out in the CAP 2019. As of 31 October, there were 46,615 EVs registered in the national fleet.</p>  <p>  In the past year, many new BEVs with ranges of over 400km on a single charge have been introduced to the Irish market. Range anxiety is no longer an issue for electric vehicle purchasers, and while PHEVs provided an interim option, but emit both CO2 and air pollution emissions, this interim option is no longer necessary. Government supports should be provided to full electric vehicles, which will be the most effective means of reaching our carbon reduction pathway. </p>  <p>  I announced after the budget that grant support for PHEVs will be removed from 1 January 2022. Any PHEV which registers for the grant in accordance with the scheme rules before this date will be approved and the commitment carried forward into Q1 2022. However, from 1 January 2022 the SEAI will no longer accept grant applications in respect of PHEVs. For the top 10 PHEVS sold in 2020, four are high cost vehicles for which a grant would not be applicable and two have a direct BEV equivalent, that would be more useful in terms of decarbonizing the car fleet. Of the four remaining, three are made by manufacturers that have an equivalent size BEV model and only one model has no BEV alternative in its range.</p>  <p>  Under the Terms and Conditions of the grant process, drawdowns normally need to be made by year end (31 Dec). However, due to the slowdown in global car manufacturing, I am extending this drawdown date to 31 March 2021, to allow time for customers to take final possession of the vehicle.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that PHEV owners will still be able to avail of other incentives currently in place including:</p>  <p>  -  Tolling reductions of 25% up to a threshold of &euro;500 per annum per household for private vehicles and a maximum annual threshold of &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles;</p>  <p>  -  Low rate of annual motor tax; and</p>  <p>  -  Home charger grant of &euro;600 per household.</p></reply>

Under the National Development Plan &euro;1bn has been allocated to specific carbon reduction measures, including vehicle electrification and provision of recharging infrastructure for low emitting vehicles.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the electric vehicle charging network over the coming years. A national charging infrastucture strategy is being developed which will set out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2030. My Department is engaging with relevant stakeholders to inform this work and it is envisaged that the strategy will be published early next year.</p>  <p>  Preparations are underway to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point  infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  Having an effective and reliable recharging network is essential to enabling drivers to choose electric. Charging at home is the most convenient and cheapest way to recharge. Targeting the installation of smart home chargers is a priority as we look to moving towards more energy efficient and sustainable ways to charge. A grant is available from the SEAI for those individuals seeking to install a home charger.</p>  <p>  There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project can be found at www.esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades.</p>  <p>  In terms of existing supports for public charging, the Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2021 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department has committed to reviewing the Scheme in the coming months to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort.</p>  <p>  My Department is also making &euro;2 million available this year through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p></reply>

It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future.</p>  <p>  The Government earlier this year introduced a requirement that new buildings and those undergoing substantial renovation works will have to include charging points for electric vehicles if they have more than 10 car parking spaces.</p>  <p>  The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. As regards existing apartment buildings, work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments.

On 24 January 2020, the Department of Transport received a Letter of Formal Notice from the European Commission relating to the late transposition of Council Directive (EU) 2017/159. </p>  <p>  Directive 2017/159 implements a social partners agreement concerning the implementation of the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 aimed at ensuring decent living and working conditions on board fishing vessels.  The Directive covers a number of requirements for work on board including conditions of service, accommodation and food, occupational safety and health protection, medical care and social security. Transposition of the Directive was a complex exercise and a number of separate Statutory Instruments had to be put in place to ensure continuity with existing legislation. </p>  <p>  This work is now complete and, on 7 September 2020, my Department communicated to the European Commission via the European Commission National Execution Measures System (NEMS) that the Directive had been transposed in full.  The final view of the European Commission on this infringement case is awaited.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to put in place the necessary measures to improve the transposition, implementation and enforcement of transport law in Ireland. A dedicated EU Coordination Unit within my Department is responsible for engaging with the EU Commission on these issues and works closely with responsible Officials in the Department of Transport, and other Departments as required, in response to each case.</p></reply>

As part of the European Commission decision on the restructuring of Bank of Ireland, the State undertook to review the options available to achieve financial inclusion, drawing on best practice international approaches to resolving this issue.</p>  <p>  The Strategy for Financial Inclusion was developed in 2011 in response to this. Its goal was to identify actions to achieve a substantial reduction in financial exclusion over a 3-5 year period. A review was conducted by a project team from the Social Finance Foundation under the aegis of a Steering Group composed of key stakeholders, which included the Department of Finance and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).</p>  <p>  The fundamental conclusion was that access to transaction banking should be the priority because it is key to accessing other financial services (for example insurance, savings and credit). Accordingly, the Strategy for Financial Inclusion called for the nationwide launch of a Standard Bank Account as a first step in promoting Financial Inclusion. The Minister then convened the Financial Inclusion Working Group (FIWG) to implement this recommendation.</p>  <p>  A pilot project for a Basic Bank Account was run for a 9 month period and concluded in March 2013. The pilot was not extended to a national roll out because take up was very low (only 205 accounts were opened) and the Payment Accounts Directive was then being negotiated.</p>  <p>  The Payment Accounts Directive was transposed into Irish law in 2016, and contains a right to open a payment account with basic features with a credit institution. All of the main retail banks in Ireland provide such bank accounts. The most recent figures from the Central Bank of Ireland shows that in 2019 there were 47,116 accounts with basic features opened across all the banks. </p></reply>

To qualify for the BRSS, a business must be able to demonstrate that the turnover from its trade in the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 is no more than 25% of a &lsquo;reference turnover amount&rsquo;, which is based on when the business commenced.  A qualifying person may, since early September, make a claim under BRSS for a single payment which will be equal to three times the average weekly turnover of the relevant business activity in a reference period, subject to a maximum payment under the scheme of &euro;15,000.  Closing date for applications is 30 November 2021.  </p>  <p>  Eligible businesses may make a claim for a once-off support payment under BRSS irrespective of whether they have previously qualified for other COVID-19 related Government schemes and detailed operational guidelines on the scheme are available on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  Registration for BRSS opened on 6 September 2021. Up to 18 November, 1,490 businesses with 1,590 trades have availed of BRSS and claims of &euro;5.5 million have been made under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed individuals, including those in the hospitality sector may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP). Businesses may also be eligible to warehouse certain tax liabilities.  In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, a reduction in the VAT rate applying to supplies of certain goods and services which primarily relate to the hospitality and tourism sector from 13.5% to 9% was announced in Budget 2021 and the reduced rate was extended until 1 September, 2022 in the Finance (COVID-19 and Miscellaneous provisions) Act 2021. </p>  <p>  CRSS is provided for in section 11 of the Finance Act 2020.  To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. A business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the relevant business activity during the period of restrictions will be no more than 25% of the average weekly turnover of the business in a reference period, which in most cases is 2019. Eligibility for the scheme depends on the particular circumstances of the individual business.  CRSS remains available to qualifying businesses until 31 December 2021.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;704m has already been paid out under the CRSS in respect of 25,500 premises.</p>  <p>  The Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) provides a subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment. </p>  <p>  The objective of the EWSS is to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. </p>  <p>  The cost to date (as at 18th November) is almost &euro;6.4 billion, comprising of direct subsidy payments of &euro;5.505 billion and PRSI forgone of almost &euro;865 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 687,600 employees.</p>  <p>  It is widely acknowledged that the EWSS has played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees during this pandemic. </p>  <p>  Government policy has been that there will be no cliff edge to the support, at the same time, it is necessary to unwind and phase out this temporary, emergency support measure. That is why, on Budget Day, I announced the extension of EWSS in a graduated form until 30 April 2022. This ensures there will be no sudden end to the EWSS and also provides clarity and certainty to business. </p>  <p>  The purpose of these schemes is to give viable businesses the opportunity to survive the economic shock of the pandemic and to help as many as possible to recover and seek to ensure their future.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to assess the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and I will continue to work with my Ministerial colleagues to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to mitigate these effects. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-23a.519.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021112300073#WRL01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236, 237, 238 and 239 together.</p>  <p>  Section 118(5G) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) provides for the Cycle-to-Work scheme. This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee.</p>  <p>  Under section 118B TCA 1997 an employer and employee may also enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement under which the employee agrees to sacrifice part of his or her salary, in exchange for a bicycle and related safety equipment.</p>  <p>  Where a bicycle or safety equipment is purchased under the Cycle to Work scheme or through a salary sacrifice arrangement certain conditions must be met, for example:</p>  <p>  - The exemption applies to the first &euro;1,250 of expenditure incurred by the employer in obtaining a bicycle and related safety equipment. This exemption limit is increased to &euro;1,500 for pedelecs or ebikes and related safety equipment. Employers may incur costs in excess of these limits, but any such excess will not qualify for the exemption and will be liable to tax. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same monetary limits.</p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be new and must be purchased by the employer. </p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be used by the employee or director mainly for the whole or part of their journey to or from work.</p>  <p>  - An employee or director can only avail of the Cycle to Work scheme once in any 4 year period. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same time limits and any salary sacrifice arrangement entered into must be completed within a 12 month period.</p>  <p>  The Cycle to Work scheme is only applicable where the bicycle and safety equipment is provided by an employer to either a director or someone in its employment. Thus, where an employer-employee relationship does not exist, for example, in the case of self-employed individuals, students, retired individuals, job seekers or those in unpaid work, such individuals can&rsquo;t qualify for the scheme. Likewise, salary sacrifice arrangements may only be entered into between an employer and a director or employee.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the cycle to work scheme operates on a self-administration basis. Relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of its particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation. There is no notification procedure for employers involved. This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers. Accordingly, there are no records available on the number of people availing of the scheme or the cost of the scheme. </p>  <p>  Tax expenditure reports prepared by my Department in 2020 have previously estimated the full year's cost at &euro;4 million covering an estimated 20,000 employees but have been clear that these figures were estimates as separate returns are not required. This gives an estimated average tax relief of &euro;200 per employee.</p>  <p>  In the recent Report on Tax Expenditures 2021 published as part of Budget 2022, it was estimated that there would be 25,000 beneficiaries under the scheme at a cost of &euro;5.5 million for a full year.  (This recognised the increase in the allowable expenditure from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,500 in respect of e-bikes and &euro;1,250 in respect of bicycles and allowed the purchase of a new bicycle every four years instead of five, as provided for in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020). The Report is clear that these numbers are estimates as separate returns are not required under the cycle to work scheme. Increases in the thresholds as outlined by the Deputy would be likely to increase the numbers availing of the scheme, the potential benefit to employees, as well as the overall cost but the impact cannot be readily estimated.  </p></reply>

The EWSS is operated on a self-assessment basis with the onus on applicants to satisfy themselves that they fully meet the eligibility criteria for the scheme as set down in the legislation and to self-declare to Revenue that they correctly qualify. The eligibility conditions for the scheme require that a business has tax clearance and that a minimum 30% decline in business turnover or customer orders has occurred due to the impact of COVID-19. </p>  <p>  For pay dates between 1 July 2021 and 31 December 2021, the legislation specifically provides that where a business commenced trading in 2019 (but not later than 1 November 2019), it must be able to demonstrate a minimum 30% reduction in either turnover or in customer orders by comparing the trading months in 2019 to the equivalent months in 2021. The legislation does not make any provision to apply a different comparison in circumstances where a business changes its operating model to an extent that the 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders is not achieved, for example where a pub begins serving food in addition to drinks as part of its trade.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the business in question registered for the EWSS on 15 September 2020 and received payments until it deregistered from the scheme on 5 October 2021. As the business started trading in April 2019, it is required to compare its turnover or customer orders for April to December 2021 against the equivalent period in 2019, to determine if there is a minimum 30% decline in turnover or business orders, for pay dates falling between 1 July 2021 to 31 December 2021.</p>  <p>  From the information provided by the business, it is not currently experiencing a minimum 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders and as such is not entitled to the EWSS. The fact that the business started serving food as part of its trade in 2020 does not change the requirement to compare turnover or customer orders for 2021 against the equivalent period in 2019. </p>  <p>  Finally to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, I have no plans to review the eligibility criteria for the EWSS that applied since the introduction of the scheme. </p></reply>

This includes banks in which the State has a shareholding.</p>  <p>  Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. </p>  <p>  With regards to supporting customers with online banking activities, AIB have informed me that in order to comply with the EU&rsquo;s Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) regulations, they have introduced additional measures around online purchasing. Personal customers do not require a smart phone to complete purchases online and more information on this can be found on the AIB website. </p>  <p>  Business customers, however, are required to download the AIB Authenticator App in order to authenticate online purchases through either a smart phone or tablet.</p>  <p>  Personal customers have a choice in terms of how they want to set up SCA for accessing online banking services, including alternatives to a smartphone or a mobile phone. These alternative options include:</p>  <p>  - If  customers don&rsquo;t wish to use the App or don&rsquo;t have a mobile phone, they can set up SCA with a Card Reader. The Card Reader is a security device that works in conjunction with the customer&rsquo;s AIB Debit Card and PIN to generate unique security codes which are used to complete certain AIB Phone and Internet Banking transactions, including logon access. A Card Reader can be ordered through the 'Services &amp;amp; Settings' section on Internet Banking or by contacting AIB&rsquo;s Customer Services team on 0818 724 724. </p>  <p>  - Customers can contact AIB&rsquo;s Customer Services team on 0818 724 724 to enquire about setting up SCA for online banking logon access via SMS text message.</p></reply>

Revenue has advised me that the purpose of the FRE review, which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, was to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day employments and work practices. </p>  <p>  Each category of FRE allowance was examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements of section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, which provides that expenses are tax deductible only if they are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred by the employee in the performance of the duties of his or her employment and are not reimbursed by the employer.  Where the FRE amount does not meet the legislative basis for tax deductibility or can no longer be justified, it cannot be expected that the FRE amount will be retained. The outcome of the review was that some FREs were planned to be removed, others were due to be increased while some were planned to be decreased.</p>  <p>  Revenue agreed to defer the implementation of any planned changes to the FRE regime initially until 1 January 2021, pending the outcome of a review relating to the tax deductibility of expenses in employment by the Tax Strategy Group (TSG), which is overseen by my Department.  At my request, Revenue agreed to further defer the implementation of any planned changes to the FRE regime until 1 January 2022 as deliberations are continuing on a number of policy options, set out by the Tax Strategy Group (TSG), as to how the flat rate expense issue could be addressed. In light of the continuing difficulties arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, I propose to ask Revenue to defer implementation of the changes for a further period.  This will provide Revenue with an opportunity to update the review during 2022, including re-examining the relative positions of those working in the healthcare sector who are required to supply and launder their own uniforms.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that apart from the FRE regime, all employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent which the expenses are not reimbursed by the employer.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which prohibits Member States from intervening.  </p><p>Nonetheless, this Government recognises the fact that a number of high-risk activity sectors, including equestrian pursuits, are facing difficulty in terms of affordability and availability of insurance. It has therefore prioritised the implementation of the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>. As the Deputy may be aware, the first Action Plan Implementation Report, which was published in July, shows that significant progress has been made: 34 of the 66 actions contained therein have now been completed. </p><p>One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines some six months ahead of schedule. Early data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) shows that since the commencement of the new Guidelines award levels have reduced by an average of 40%. This is an encouraging development and it is my hope that this trend will result in lower costs for businesses.  As the insurance reform agenda progresses, we will continue to hold the industry to account on its commitments to pass on savings from the Guidelines, and other elements of the reforms, to customers. Minister of State Fleming met last week with the CEO&rsquo;s of main insurance companies operating in Ireland, and he stressed the need for them to reduce premiums and increase their risk appetite to offer cover in new or neglected areas. </p><p>Securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government. As part of that, action on insurance reform is being driven forward at the highest level. As the Deputy may be aware, the Cabinet Committee on Insurance Reform is tasked with overseeing the implementation of the Action Plan and is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste. Work remains ongoing on a whole-of Government basis to ensure the timely implementation of the remaining elements of the Action plan. Of particular relevance is the fact that the Minister for Justice has signalled her intention to bring forward legislative changes to the duty of care. It is understood that these are at an advanced stage and it is hoped that they will have a significant impact on the issue of 'slips, trips and falls', which will significantly assist the sporting and outdoor activity sector as a whole. </p><p>Finally, I would like to note that it is my intention to continue to work with my Government colleagues and ensure that the implementation of the Action Plan will continue to have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for all individuals, businesses and community groups across the country.</p></reply>

For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders and, under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  </p>  <p>  Within this regulatory framework, the decision to grant or refuse an application for residential mortgage credit, irrespective of the precise purpose of the residential mortgage credit, remains a commercial matter for the individual lender. However, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Consumer Protection Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that if any person is not satisfied with the way a regulated mortgage provider has dealt with them in relation to an application for a mortgage, the consumer can complain directly to the regulated entity.  If they are not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the borrower may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman who, if a valid complaint is made, will independently consider matter. </p>  <p>  More generally, the Department the Environment, Climate and Communications is in the process of developing a residential retrofit loan guarantee scheme and, while the specific features of the scheme are still under development, such a scheme should help support lending by banks for retrofit purposes.  It should also be noted that some of the main lenders are now offering mortgages at competitive rates for 'green' energy efficient residential mortgages. </p></reply>

Digital gaming is a sector that has seen exponential global growth in the past decade, however this growth has not been reflected in industry growth here in Ireland. Ireland has the potential to utilise the synergies with our established film and animation sectors, to support employment in creative and digital arts in the State.</p>  <p>  The relief will take the form of a corporation tax credit, the beneficiaries of which will be digital games development companies. The rate of the credit will be 32%, available on eligible expenditure of up to &euro;25 million per game. The credit will be available on expenditure incurred in the design, production and testing stages of the development of qualifying digital games, provided certain conditions are met.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that European Commission State aid approval will be required prior to the introduction of the tax credit. Therefore the Finance Bill 2021 legislation is being introduced subject to a commencement order, pending completion of the State aid approval process.</p>  <p>  As the relief is a cultural one, in order to avail of the credit, a digital game development company must first apply to the Minster for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media for a cultural certificate.  As part of this certification process, a digital game development company will be required to complete an &ldquo;Undertaking in respect of quality employment&rdquo; in order to qualify for the relief. This undertaking is similar to the requirements in place under the Section 481 Film Tax Credit. It commits applicants to compliance with all relevant employment legislation. It is crucial that employee rights are upheld in all industries and the inclusion of this provision reinforces the importance of adhering to employment legislation in the digital gaming sector.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Undertaking for quality employment&rdquo; does not include a requirement to adhere to Workplace Relations Commission Codes of Practice or to pay the Living Wage. However the undertaking commits applicants to have in place written policies and procedures in relation to grievances, discipline and dignity at work. I am satisfied that the conditions outlined in the &ldquo;Undertaking in respect of quality employment&rdquo; are effective in ensuring that recipients of the Tax Credit for Digital Games are operating in accordance with applicable employment law. If an applicant company does not adhere to the conditions specified in the undertaking, any credit claimed may be subject to recoupment by Revenue.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government. The Low Pay Commission is currently examining the issues around this commitment and will make recommendations on the best approach to achieving it within the lifetime of the Government. However as the Living Wage has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement, and as the Low Pay Commission has not yet made recommendations to Government regarding the development of the Living Wage, I do not believe its inclusion as a requirement for the Tax Credit for Digital Games is appropriate. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the monitoring of compliance with employment rights legislation is primarily a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, through the Workplace Relations Commission. While the importance of employment rights will be reflected in the tax credit for digital game, the WRC remains the appropriate avenue to address non-compliance with employment rights legislation.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p>  <p>  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the following medical criteria, in order to obtain a Primary Medical Certificate:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs;</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>  <p>  The current medical criteria medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation).</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer. Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.</p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken.</p>  <p>  In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within the wider review that was commenced in March 2020 under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities. Its work was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Minister O&rsquo;Gorman has confirmed that he has asked his officials to reconvene the working group established to carry out that review at the earliest opportunity and we are both agreed that this is the most appropriate forum for the review. With this in mind, my officials will work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

The standard rate of income tax is currently 20%.  The non-resident landlord can claim credit for the tax withheld by the tenant when declaring the income on a tax return.</p>  <p>  If a tenant is paying rent to an Irish collection agent of a non-resident landlord, rather than directly to the landlord, the tenant is not obliged or entitled to deduct income tax from the rent.  However, the landlord is assessable and chargeable to income tax in the name of the Irish collection agent (section 1034 TCA). </p>  <p>  The third-party platform mentioned by the Deputy is normally used for short-term holiday lettings, and income from such lettings is not taxed under Schedule D Case V.  If the person who owns the property is regularly letting it out for short-term lettings, the income is treated as trading income (Schedule D Case I) and does not come under the withholding tax regime mentioned above in sections 238(2) and 1041 TCA.</p>  <p>  Revenue receives details of payments made via third-party platforms by virtue of section 888 TCA.</p></reply>

This Guidance and FAQs document has been continually updated to reflect public health and Government policy throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The FAQs have been prepared to assist employees and management in the Civil and Public Service to understand the process, rules and expectations associated with work arrangements during the COVID-19 across the public service.</p><p>In order to continue to facilitate physical distancing and public health requirements, Civil and Public Service employers are providing for working from home where possible, and continuing temporary alternative arrangements e.g. flexible shifts, staggered hours, longer opening hours, blended working patterns, weekend working etc., where feasible.</p><p>An example of this flexibility is where an employee is required to restrict their movements as a close contact. In this case the employer should facilitate working from home. If remote working in an employee&rsquo;s current role is not feasible, then the assignment of work may be outside of their usual core duties or they may be given another role. Employees must cooperate with all such flexibilities while they are restricting their movements. In all such cases, employees remain available for work whilst at home. It should be noted that this arrangement does not apply to employees where a quarantine period is required as a result of travel.

The gardens are a place of quiet serenity, reflection, and remembrance. In excess of 400,000 members of the public visit the gardens on an annual basis.</p>  <p>  Following a visual inspection by the Park Manager at Irish National War Memorial Gardens, who had raised concerns with regard to the safety of the trees on the entrance avenue, an independent Arborist was commissioned to undertake a full technical survey of the trees. This survey was reviewed on site by the Chief Park Superintendent, who agreed with the finding of the consultant arborist.  Twelve trees, mainly Norway and Silver Maples along the entrance avenue were identified for felling, due to decay caused by fungal infections such as Ganoderma and also due to their weakened structural crowns. Unfortunately, these trees pose an unacceptable risk to public safety, on this very busy pedestrian and vehicular avenue and for this reason, the tree felling is essential.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works will plant a new avenue of 18 trees, Acer x fremanii &lsquo;Autumn Blaze&rsquo; over the coming season on the entrance road to the gardens, in addition to a new footpath. This new avenue will replace those trees lost over the last number of years and the current dangerous trees. The single species avenue will provide a formal approach to the gardens as was the original design intention. The species selected is fast growing, has great autumn colour, will add to the biodiversity and at maturity will be 40-50 ft. tall.</p>  <p>  OPW has a Tree Safety Management Policy for National Historic Properties including the Irish National War Memorial Gardens, which balances the need for safety with the conservation of the trees on a risk assessment basis, at all their sites. Whether trees are managed for their cultural, amenity, heritage or environmental benefits, their management must be balanced and proportionate to the actual risks from trees. Trees naturally lose branches or may fall over a period of time. OPW only fells trees when absolutely necessary and in the public interest.</p>  <p>  The new avenue of trees will be a significant improvement to the setting of the Irish National War Memorial Gardens, while improving public safety and universal access.</p></reply>

It has a conservation remit under the National Monuments Acts 1930 - 2004 to maintain the National Monuments in State care and an active, though non-statutory, role in facilitating presentation and public access.</p><p>The approach of the OPW Heritage Services is essentially conservation and protection oriented with the bulk of resources dedicated to this end. The vast majority of national monuments in State care are presented to the public without specific visitor facilities such as a guide service. Public access however, to heritage attractions is a high priority and much effort has been made to improve access and information at all built heritage sites.</p><p>There is a total of almost 1,000 individual National Monuments in State care at approximately 768 locations around the country.  As a general policy, the OPW facilitates visitor access to as many National Monument sites as possible, however, access is not always feasible due to a range of issues including physical location, risks associated with dangerous structures, and restrictions imposed in some cases by landowners who may wish to limit access, either temporarily or more long term, by reason of accident risk, livestock etc. </p><p>Having regard to principles of Universal Access, the OPW is committed insofar as is feasible to ensure that heritage sites in its care which are open to the public are as accessible as possible to all users.However, given the nature of these properties, their antiquity and restrictions in terms of works permitted under Section 14 of the National Monuments Act, it is not always possible to provide universal access.  </p><p>At sites where there are accessibility issues the OPW endeavours to bring this to visitors&rsquo; attention on our website, www.heritageireland.ie.</p><p>The OPW offers free entry for visitors with disabilities and their accompanying carers at all of our sites where an admission charge applies. The OPW is committed to providing the best possible experience to visitors with disabilities and, accordingly, provides a range of disability awareness and related training to the visitor-facing staff at our heritage sites. For example, the OPW recently engaged Arts &amp;amp; Disability Ireland to provide Disability Equality Training, specifically tailored for arts organisations who want to include artists and audiences with disabilities in what they do and, also,  <i>Painting with Words</i>&ndash; an Audio Description training course that will better empower our guide staff to provide tours to visitors with visual challenges.</p><p>The OPW has also, within the last two years, run Deaf Awareness and Irish Sign Language (ISL) training courses for some of its staff. In addition to this, we run a scheduled programme of ISL tours at sites around the country, albeit currently interrupted by Covid 19 but which it is intended, will resume in 2022. We endeavour to provide ISL interpretation on request but given that such requests usually involve advance planning and notification, we are examining ways to support independent, unplanned visits.  We are, therefore, developing ISL video tours that will enable members of the Deaf community to join regular scheduled tours.  The first of these can be viewed on the Tintern Abbey page on the Heritage Ireland website and more are in production. We are also in the process of developing other ISL resources such as the ISL interpretation associated with Mn&aacute; 100, an online resource on the role of women in Irish history. This and other ISL resources can be found at the ISL Resources tab on the Dublin Castle website www.dublincastle.ie. The OPW has also commenced a process of adding ISL interpretation to existing AV films; an example of this can be seen on the Reginald&rsquo;s Tower page on the Heritage Ireland website.</p><p>The OPW is also working to make our heritage sites more autism-friendly. Many OPW guides have received training from AsIAm, Ireland's National Autism Charity and have developed Social Guides to help autistic visitors prepare for their visit. This information can be found under the &lsquo;Social Guide&rsquo; section of the individual site pages on the Heritage Ireland website.</p><p>Some OPW guide staff have recently participated in Azure training for the delivery of art tours that are tailored towards people living with dementia and their families and friends. The OPW is also participating in an Erasmus+ project application, &lsquo;AIDA - Alzheimer patients Interaction through Digital and Arts&rsquo;, with other European partners. Following on from these initiatives, we hope to be in a position to offer dementia-friendly experiences at our heritage sites in 2022.</p></reply>

Guests attending a wedding reception are not required to show such proof of immunity.  This position is consistent with the approach throughout the period of the pandemic, during which time the Government has made special provision for weddings in view of the importance of these occasions to couples and the level of planning that is involved for couples and their families.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this position, individuals and businesses are continually reminded to monitor the ongoing risk from COVID-19 and to take personal responsibility as they take steps individually and collectively to keep this risk under control.  The current high level of COVID-19 infection and the dominance of the significantly more transmissible Delta variant poses a very substantial threat, particularly to those who are not fully-protected through vaccination.  Accordingly, we understand that the NPHET&rsquo;s advice remains that those who are unvaccinated should avoid congregated indoor settings for their own and others safety.</p></reply>

This allocation provided for funding of &euro;50,000 for every local authority in 2021 and a supplementary fund to support local authorities who identified additional, specific requirements.  </p>  <p>  For 2022, I have again allocated current funding of &euro;5 million to support the Decade of Centenaries Programme, maintaining funding at current levels.  My intention is to maintain the funding allocation of &euro;50,000 for each local authority into 2022.  Further announcements in this regard will be made shortly when the arrangements are finalised.  </p>  <p>  Plans are well underway to mark the significant forthcoming centenaries over the remainder of the Decade of Centenaries, including the Civil War and the Foundation of the State.  I expect to be in a position to publish a substantive commemorative programme for 2022 in due course and planning is already underway for 2023.  My plans for the forthcoming period continue to be informed by the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations and developed in consultation with the All Party Consultation Group on Commemorations. </p>  <p>  My Department has built significant partnerships with key stakeholders, including local authorities, the national cultural institutions, institutions of learning, custodians of records, and creative communities.  All of these have an important role in supporting the national conversation about the events of this period and encouraging respectful public discourse and debate.  </p>  <p>  The approaching centenaries present particularly sensitive and complex challenges. My primary objective in developing plans for the remainder of the Decade of Centenaries, is to ensure that we promote peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland by encouraging a deeper understanding of the significance of this period, which accepts that the shared historical experiences of those years gave rise to very different narratives and memories.  </p></reply>

Funding for the Basic Income Guarantee Pilot Scheme was a key priority of mine for Budget 2022 and I secured &euro;25m to realise the pilot scheme next year. </p><p>As Minister with responsibility for Arts and Culture, I am conscious of the value that this sector brings to all Irish citizens.  The importance of Irish culture, Irish art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be understated - it contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output.  </p><p>In relation to the timeline for the launch of the pilot the Deputy will appreciate that this is a major policy intervention requiring significant resources to develop a coherent policy and to operationalise.  This work is ongoing and my ambition is to open the scheme for applications early in Q1 2022.  </p><p>My Department will hold a stakeholder consultation forum on December 8th on the basic income guarantee pilot scheme, to provide stakeholders with the opportunity to engage with the policy development and share their views.  Stakeholder engagement has been central to my Department's response to the pandemic and this forum will ensure that the arts sector, those working in it and the resource bodies and representative organisations are given the opportunity to feed into the policy development for the scheme.</p><p>The selection process for recipients of the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement early next month, however, I can confirm the following: </p><p>- Participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test.</p><p>- It will be a non-competitive process, therefore once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria theywill be included in a randomised selection process.</p><p>- A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive <i>ex post</i>appraisal of the pilot in due course. </p><p>- Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement.  </p><p>I believe the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives. In addition to this measure, I also secured continued investment of &euro;130m for the Arts Council in 2022. Combined, these measures will significantly contribute to the development of the arts in Ireland. </p></reply>

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission. Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached.</p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.</p>  <p>  This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions relating to their use in apartments and in educational/community/religious buildings. </p>  <p>  In light of the need to appropriately address aviation safety concerns arising from the &ldquo;glint and glare&rdquo; impacts of solar panels and the easing of the solar panel planning exemption thresholds, my Department is in the process of commissioning the development of detailed aviation safeguarding maps which will identify and delineate specific but limited areas in the vicinity of airports and aerodromes (referred to as exclusion zones) within which the exemptions will not apply. Project scoping feedback has been received from interested parties through the draft Request for Tender process and has been considered by my Department in the development of the final Request for Tender documentation. My Department intends to publish the call for tender shortly. </p>  <p>  Whilst this work is ongoing, my Department has advanced interim regulations, adopting a temporary, albeit more stringent, radial approach incorporating initial defined exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes. These interim regulations, allowing for increased solar panel planning exemptions, will cover the vast majority of the land area of the country, only excluding those limited exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  The draft interim regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive 2001/42/EC and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. It is anticipated that the formal SEA process will commence, with consultation with the statutory environmental authorities to inform the content of the Environmental Report, following the completion of the screening for Appropriate Assessment by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit. The SEA Environmental Report will be published alongside a draft of the interim regulations for a period of public consultation of not less than 4 weeks. This public consultation is expected to commence in December. A copy of the draft interim regulations and the Environmental Report will be made available for inspection over this period. Written submissions or observations will be taken into consideration before finalisation of the draft interim regulations in early 2022.</p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the process for finalising the interim solar panel planning exemptions as referred to above, with interim exclusion zones around airports and aerodromes, is now expected to be completed in early 2022. As outlined, pending the finalisation of the aforementioned aviation safeguarding maps, these interim regulations will allow for the vast majority of the country to be covered by the proposed new solar panel exemptions apart from those areas in close proximity to airports and aerodromes.</p>  <p>  Work on the development of the aviation safeguarding maps for airports and aerodromes is expected to be completed in Q2 2022. The final supplementary set of regulations - delineating the final exclusion areas around airports and aerodromes in which the exemptions will not apply - will be prepared thereafter and, subject to environmental reporting considerations, will subsequently be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in a timely manner. </p></reply>

To have OUV a property must be so exceptional for present and future generations so as to transcend national boundaries. Ireland&rsquo;s current Tentative List of World Heritage Properties was submitted to UNESCO in 2010. In keeping with UNESCO guidance to review the Tentative List at least once every ten years, my Department initiated a review of the Tentative List in 2019 by seeking applications from local authorities and the wider heritage sector for natural and/or cultural heritage sites which may be considered to possess OUV. The deadline for applications was 30 June 2021. </p>  <p>  I appointed an Expert Advisory Group (EAG) to assess the potential OUV and other UNESCO requirements in respect of the six valid applications received, and earlier this month I informed each of the applicants of the EAG&rsquo;s recommendations. Further information on the recommendations can be found here www.gov.ie/en/press-release/71039-minister-endorses-recommendations-for-new-world-heritage-tentative-list/. </p>  <p>  My Department is now liaising closely with all applicants to assist them in addressing the EAG&rsquo;s recommendations and it is envisaged that a new Tentative List will be submitted to UNESCO in 2022. It is important to note however that inclusion on the Tentative List does not necessarily result in the inscription of a property on the World Heritage List. The nomination process itself often takes a number of years and includes the preparation of a detailed dossier to be officially submitted to the World Heritage Centre in Paris for evaluation. </p>  <p>  Simultaneously with the ongoing Tentative List revision process, my Department is also developing a World Heritage Strategy to guide the future management and nomination of World Heritage Properties in Ireland. This Strategy will inform future Tentative List revision processes and it is envisioned that applications to the Tentative List will be opened up on a more frequent basis than heretofore.</p></reply>

Exchequer funding provided by my Department is governed by a protocol agreement between the Department and the lead authority in each region. This protocol sets out the funding arrangements and structures to ensure adherence with statutory and public financial procedures. The protocol agreement requires that local authorities and their service delivery partners, including voluntary NGOs and private operators, comply with all statutory codes including the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, the Fire Services Acts and the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016.</p>  <p>  In respect of Garda Vetting, the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012-2016 sets out the legal requirements for Garda vetting and the parameters for same.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual local authorities.</p>  <p>  Under the Housing Act 1988 it is a matter for each local authority to determine whether a person is regarded as homeless; section 2 of the Act sets out the requirements in this regard.  When a household has been assessed as homeless, section 10 of the Housing Act 1988, provides that a local authority may provide accommodation and related services to that household.</p>  <p>  Having regard to the statutory role of housing authorities under the Housing Act 1988, all households are assessed, and provided with homeless services, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation, irrespective of ethnicity.</p>  <p>  The organisation of accommodation services is a matter for the relevant housing authorities, and in Dublin, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive. Housing authorities can and do consider requests for homeless supports and have provided emergency accommodation to non-Irish national applicants, in line with current provisions under the Housing Act 1988.</p>  <p>  Housing for All, a New Housing Plan for Ireland, adopted and published in September 2021, acknowledges that housing policy must address the needs of socially excluded members of society. It states that, &ldquo;It is recognised that Traveller and Roma communities are represented amongst the homeless population. We will support continued implementation of the current National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, and actions to be identified in the successor to that strategy.&rdquo;  It is within this context and framework that wider housing policy matters are being further addressed.</p></reply>

Their aim is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings. The Building Regulations are set out in functional terms and are performance based &ndash; they do not set limitations on the materials.</p><p>The associated Technical Guidance Documents (TGD A - M respectively) provide technical guidance on how to comply with the regulations in practical terms for non-complex buildings.  Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant technical guidance, such works are considered to be, <i>prima facie</i>, in compliance with the relevant regulations.</p><p>Part D (Materials and Workmanship) requires that all works should be carried out in a workmanlike manner using <i>&ldquo;proper materials&hellip;which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used&rdquo; </i>to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations and includes materials which comply with an appropriate harmonised standard or European Technical Assessment or comply with an appropriate Irish Standard or Irish Agr&eacute;ment Certificate or with an alternative national technical specification of any State which is a contracting party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, which provides in use an equivalent level of safety and suitability.</p><p>A fundamental review of Part B (Fire Safety) is underway at present and will take note of Fire Safety in Ireland report (published in 2018).  It will also consider common and emerging building trends, developments and events from a global perspective, matters relating to external fire spread, external fire resistance, internal fire resistance, cladding systems, sprinklers, etc. Changes in standards, including fire test standards and technological changes in areas such as materials and systems have necessitated a fundamental analysis of the provisions and assumptions contained in Technical Guidance Document B &ndash; Fire Safety.</p><p>In this context my Department established a Consultative Committee in December 2020 to discuss the technical revision of Part B/TGD B. The Consultative Committee has met nine times to date, in addition to a number of sub-group meetings. Draft documentation, which includes Draft Building Regulations (Part B Amendment) Regulations 2021, Draft Technical Guidance Document B &ndash; Fire Safety 2021 and a Regulatory Impact Analysis, is currently being prepared to support a public consultation in the matter in 2022.</p><p>The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of the important policy area of building defects and provides for an examination of defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing report, &quot;Safe as Houses&quot;.</p><p>In this context, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. The plenary working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August), in addition to subgroup meetings. It has agreed its terms of reference will cover fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland. </p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the group will seek to engage with a range of interested parties, including homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals and industry stakeholders, among others to examine the issue of defects in housing and report to me on the matter. Consultation with the relevant parties has commenced and further arrangements in this regard are currently being put in place by the working group.</p><p>I am satisfied that the group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter and I look forward to a report in due course following completion of their deliberation. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020, the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. Fire services may inspect buildings, other than a dwelling house occupied as a single dwelling, in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with those who have control over premises and hold responsibility for fire safety, to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and a plan put in place for works to bring buildings into compliance. They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis.  Local authorities are independent in the use of their statutory powers.</p></reply>

The strategy is backed by historic levels of investment with in excess of &euro;20bn through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency over the next 5 years. The unprecedented levels of funding to support housing delivery will provide the sector with the stability and certainty needed to increase overall housing supply.</p><p>The Housing for All strategy prioritises an increase in social and affordable homes committing to delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes by 2030.  The national targets for social and affordable homes for 2022 to 2025 is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2022</th>       <th>2023</th>       <th>2024</th>       <th>2025</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Social</td>       <td>9,000</td>       <td>9,100</td>       <td>9,300</td>       <td>10,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Affordable</td>       <td>4,100</td>       <td>5,500</td>       <td>6,400</td>       <td>6,400</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Government will use all the channels at its disposal to increase the delivery of social and affordable housing.  In the case of affordable housing, this includes the programmes and funding streams under the Affordable Housing Fund, Cost Rental Equity Loan, Project Tosaigh and Croi Connaithe.</p><p>Under Housing for All, processes have been put in place to co-ordinate interventions and share information to ensure successful implementation, increased overall supply, complementarity, value for money for the Exchequer and securing optimum affordability for affordable housing purchasers and renters.</p><p>At a local level each local authority is currently preparing a Housing Delivery Action Plan and will engage with approved housing bodies and the Land Development Agency in this regard. These plans, which will be in line with the national Housing for All targets, will inform the level of social and affordable houses to be delivered for each area and the most appropriate delivery streams.  At a national level, my Department has recently established the High Level Affordable Housing Delivery Group to draw together the key stakeholders responsible for delivering social and affordable homes. This group is co-ordinating interventions and will monitor progress of Housing for All affordable housing programmes and targets.</p><p>Supported by this Government strategy, indications of increased construction activity are becoming evident. The latest CSO New Dwellings Completion Report shows the number of new homes becoming available for use in the year up to September was 24,156, a 7% increase when compared to the year to Q3 2020 (22,585).Additionally, the latest CSO data reports that 30,519 residential units were commenced in the year to September 2021, up 40% year-on-year, when compared to the same period to September 2020. The number of homes for which Commencement Notices were provided in September 2021 (3,203) was up 48% on August&rsquo;s figure.  Furthermore, 11,150 units were granted planning permission in Q2 2021, a 16.6% increase compared with pre-pandemic levels in Q2 2019 (9,566).</p></reply>

The Bill proposes the replacement of the SHD provisions with new LRD provisions, which will have the potential to be almost as time-efficient as the SHD arrangements but will also return the primary decision-making function to the local level, with associated gains in terms of public participation in the decision-making process. </p><p>Government approval for the publication of the LRD Bill was granted on 4 November 2021. The Bill is currently being progressed through the Houses of the Oireachtas with a view to enactment during the current Oireachtas session.</p><p>The Bill as published proposes a number of transitional arrangements in relation to the expiry of the SHD arrangements and their replacement by the new LRD arrangements. Under the proposals </p><p>-  developers with projects already in the SHD system and in receipt of an opinion on their proposals from An Bord Plean&aacute;la (the Board) on the commencement of the Act will have 16 weeks to submit an SHD application to the Board from that date;</p><p>-  developers who have just commenced SHD pre-application consultations with the Board, and areawaiting an opinion on their proposals on the commencement of the Act,  will have 16 weeks to submit an SHD application from the date of receipt  of the pre-application consultation opinion from the Board. </p><p>In both of these scenarios, the Board will then have a further 16 weeks to make a determination on the application. These are standard transitional arrangements, which generally apply when changing over from one system or process to another.</p><p>Pending the enactment of the Bill and the making of supplementary LRD regulations, the existing SHD arrangements remain in force.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature. </p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. As set out in <i>Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland</i>, the efficiency of the banding model and its application to local authorities will be considered. Equivalisation as between singles and families will also be considered. The review will also have regard to new initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and Cost Rental housing. I intend that the review will be completed this year.</p></reply>

For the purposes of the short term letting regulations, a premises used for a short term letting use is a commercial building. Accordingly, in the case of a new short-term letting use, a person should apply for change of use planning permission from a residential use to a commercial short term letting use. For an existing unauthorised short term letting use, retention permission should be sought. However, planning Authorities have no control over the number of change of use planning applications they receive. </p><p>Under the legislation planning authorities can avail of a range of measures to enforce against  unauthorised short term letting activity, of which the issuing of an enforcement notice is just one. Cork City Council have initiated 174 investigations into suspected breaches of the short-term letting regulations, and have issued 158 informal warning letters and 30 warning letters. Enforcement notices may issue in relation to a number of these investigations.</p><p>Housing for All contains a specific action - (Action 20.4) - to <i>&ldquo;develop new regulatory controls requiring short-term and holiday lets to register with F&aacute;ilte Ireland with a view to ensuring that houses are used to best effect in areas of housing need&rdquo;.</i>Minister O&rsquo;Brien has engaged with Minister Catherine Martin on this matter, and a number of meetings have been held between my Department and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and further engagement will take place in the near future.</p><p>Significant progress has been made on these proposals, which are being led by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. Funding has been allocated in Budget 2022 and F&aacute;ilte Ireland will be commencing shortly with recruitment of staff to manage the design and infrastructure for a short term lettings registration system. Work has also begun on scoping the legal changes which will be required and are expected to be legislated for by Q2 2022.</p></reply>

This will fluctuate over time, as tenancy surrender and re-letting of stock is an ongoing process. Therefore, ongoing data in relation to vacant local authority owned homes are not collated by my Department.</p>  <p>  Statistics in relation to social housing stock, at a point in time, are published by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) in their Annual Reports on Performance Indicators in Local Authorities. These reports provide a range of information in relation to social housing stock, including levels of vacancy in local authority owned properties. The most recent report, relating to 2020, is available on the NOAC website at the following link:</p>  <p>  noac.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NOAC-Local-Authority-Performance-Indicator-Report-2020.pdf.</p>  <p>  My Department and local authorities, supported by the Local Government Management Association, are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance to a planned maintenance approach as referenced in Housing for All, policy objective 20.6. This will require the implementation of centrally hosted ICT system to support the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes which will be supported by my Department&rsquo;s stock improvement funding programmes.

There are presently 37 Vacant Homes Officers in place, 34 of which are currently part time.  </p>  <p>  The provision of central funding reinforces the capacity of local authorities to provide information/statistics to my Department from a dedicated contact point within each local authority. The Vacant Homes Office therefore plays a key role in the co-ordination of this work within each local authority.   </p>  <p>  Housing for All commits to ensuring that vacant homes officers are full-time officers. This will ensure a dedicated focus on tackling vacancy and dereliction with a view to increasing the opportunities for residential development.  This will include options for both social housing and affordable housing in many towns. My Department will be communicating with local authorities before the end of the year around the future process to ensure that a member of staff is assigned to these tasks on a full-time basis.   </p></reply>

The scheme may also be used to improve private houses intended for occupation by a person surrendering a local authority house. </p><p>There are specific terms and conditions which govern the administration of the schemes and  local authorities are responsible for such administration, including the assessment, approval and prioritisation of applications with both programmes funded from the same funding stream. </p><p>My Department's approach each year is to issue a single full year allocation to each local authority, so they can plan and implement these grants programme.

It updates the State&rsquo;s law on maritime jurisdiction to reflect developments in international and domestic law and consolidates the previous legislation in one, stand-alone enactment.  </p>  <p>  Sections 17, 18 and 19 of the Act deal with the continental shelf and replace and update sections 2 and 3 of the Continental Shelf Act 1968.  The continental shelf is the natural prolongation below water of the State&rsquo;s land territory beyond the limits of its territorial sea.  To the west and south-west Ireland&rsquo;s continental shelf extends several hundred kilometres from the coast before it reaches the deep ocean floor.</p>  <p>  Depending on their location the State&rsquo;s harbours and inland bays are located either in its territorial sea or its internal waters and accordingly sections 17 &ndash; 19 of the Act do not apply to them.  There are however outstanding jurisdictional issues with the UK in respect of Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.  Following discussions in 2011 between the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the British Foreign Secretary, the Irish and British Governments agreed to try to resolve these.  Since that time a series of meetings and contacts have taken place at official level between the Foreign Office and my own Department and this engagement is ongoing.  </p>  <p>  The issues involved in these discussions are complex and involve a range of different actors on both sides, but I am satisfied that all sides are committed to reaching a positive resolution as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This will be a major challenge, but one that we are committed to achieving. </p>  <p>  Foreign Birth Registration applications are citizenship applications and, as in all jurisdictions, involve a complex and lengthy process. The Passport Service has a statutory responsibility to protect the integrity of this citizenship process.  Accordingly, it has to assure very careful analysis takes place across its systems to verify both the identity of the applicant and their entitlement to Irish citizenship. Experienced staff at the Passport Service provide systematic, detailed and rigorous checks of all Foreign Birth Registration applications.</p>  <p>  The application referenced was registered on 31 January 2020 and is waiting to be processed. All documentation submitted must be retained until it can be authenticated when the application is checked for entitlement. In the meantime, it is being stored in a secure environment.</p>  <p>  Due to the complex nature of the Foreign Birth Registration process and the pause in the Service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants are being advised that they should allow approximately 2 years for processing of Foreign Birth Registration applications at this time.</p>  <p>  The Foreign Birth Registration teams have worked since the pandemic began to consider all urgent requests to expedite applications on a case by case basis, for example applications from expectant parents, or stateless persons. Over 5,000 emergency Foreign Birth Registration applications have been processed in 2021.

The military coup, which began on 24/25 October, represents a major setback to this transition. </p><p>The military leadership&rsquo;s violent crackdown on the country&rsquo;s civilian and civil society leadership, mass detention of protestors, attacks on medical personnel and facilities, and methodical dismantling of transitional institutions are utterly unacceptable. The actions of the military, both army and former militia leaders and signatories of the Juba Peace Agreement, have put in jeopardy the hard-won transition, and the legitimate wishes of the Sudanese people for freedom, peace, justice and inclusive development. They also have worrying implications for peace and security in the region more broadly. </p><p>Sudan&rsquo;s democratic transition is too important to fail, for the people of Sudan, and for the stability of the Horn of Africa region as a whole.  The reported release and reinstatement of Prime Minister Hamdok on 21 November must be accompanied by an immediate halt to violence and repression, and the freeing of all civilian leaders and political detainees. Telecommunications must also be fully restored. Credible discussions can then commence on a way forward which honours the demands of the Sudanese people for freedom, peace and justice and puts the country back on the path to democracy.</p><p>Ireland welcomed the decision of the African Union (AU) last month to suspend Sudan from AU activities until &ldquo;the effective restoration of the civilian-led Transitional Authority&rdquo;. We are also closely following efforts by the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary General, Volker Perthes, in Khartoum, and the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Annette Weber, to engage with Sudanese and regional stakeholders.</p><p>Ireland supported a strong Security Council Press Statement on 28 October condemning the coup, and was unequivocal in denouncing the action by Sudan&rsquo;s military leaders at two Security Council meetings on Sudan, most recently on 11 November. We continue to keep further Council action under consideration as the situation unfolds, including through the three Sudan-focused mandates over which the Council presides: UNITAMS (UN Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in Sudan), UNISFA (Interim Security Force for Abyei) and the Sudan sanctions regime. </p><p>Ireland has also supported a strong EU response. High Representative Josep Borrell issued a statement on 26 October on behalf of the 27 EU Member States warning of serious consequences if the move to dismantle the transitional government was not reversed.  The situation was also discussed by Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on 15 November.</p><p>On 19 November in the wake of the killing and injury of over 100 peaceful protesters in Khartoum, Minister Coveney issued a statement condemning the reckless and unlawful actions of the coup leaders and undertaking to consider what further measures might be taken to protect and reset the path to democratic transition, and to maintain peace and security. </p><p>Ireland is ready to consider further restrictive or financial measures, including under the EU&rsquo;s Global Human Rights sanctions regime, while keeping in mind the increasing humanitarian needs on the ground.

This is essential for our health at home as well in low income countries where the impact of the pandemic is reversing hard won gains and deepening social and economic inequalities.</p>  <p>  The WHO has set a global vaccination target of 70% by the middle of next year. Currently just over 40% of the global adult population is vaccinated, with rates as low as 1% in some of the world's poorest countries. So far, over 500 million doses have been distributed to 144 countries across the globe. Over 80% of vaccines that have been delivered to low income countries have been facilitated via COVAX.</p>  <p>  My Department, with the Department of Health and the HSE, is working to help achieve this target. Recognizing the need for effective health systems if vaccination campaigns are to be successful, since the beginning of the pandemic at least &euro;200 million in Irish Aid funding has been invested in improving in global health, working with bilateral partners and at the global level, with the WHO, GAVI the Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund. Ireland is currently on the board of the Global Fund, using this opportunity to ensure continued and effective focus on the need to strengthen health systems.</p>  <p>  Irish Aid work in partner countries has been complemented by HSE know-how, for example sharing lessons from our COVID-19 response with the Mozambican health service or supporting the psychological resilience of frontline health workers in Jordan and Ethiopia.</p>  <p>  So far this year, Irish Aid has given &euro;7 million in to the COVAX facility to enable the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines for distribution to low- and middle-income countries. In addition, the Government has donated 1.3 million vaccines to COVAX, which will shortly arrive in Nigeria, Indonesia, and Egypt, among other countries.  </p>  <p>  Last month, I visited a vaccine centre in Kampala and saw some  of the 335,500 AstraZeneca doses Ireland donated directly to Uganda, and heard from the local WHO representative about the difference this donation was making. </p>  <p>  This forms part of a very significant Team Europe contribution to the pandemic response, collectively approaching &euro;2.5 billion in contributions to COVAX alone. The recent increase in the volume of financial and dose donations, particularly by the EU and its Member States, will enable the pace of vaccine deliveries to low income countries to accelerate in the coming months. </p></reply>

Ireland has also contributed &euro;10 million in 2021 to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has in turn provided US$8 million to respond to the crisis in Madagascar in recent months. </p>  <p>  My Department, through the Embassy of Ireland in Maputo and working closely with EU partners and with UN agencies, continues to monitor the situation, especially in light of the poor harvest and continuing drought. </p>  <p>  Through our engagement at the upcoming Nutrition for Growth Summit in Japan, Ireland will continue to shine a light on the scourge of hunger and malnutrition, and advocate for collective action to prevent acute food insecurity such as Madagascar is currently experiencing. </p></reply>

Officials in my Department have been in contact with the Deputy&rsquo;s office to request more information and will review the issue further once received. </p><p>I would like to set out the general position on Passenger Locator Form (PLF) requirements in the context of North-South travel. All passengers arriving into the state from overseas are required to complete an online COVID-19 PLF in accordance with SI 45 of 2021. There are limited exemptions from this requirement, as set out in the regulations. It is a mandatory requirement for passengers arriving in Ireland via Northern Ireland and who have been overseas in the 14 days prior to arrival in Ireland to complete a COVID-19 PLF. The form must also be filled out by those who arrive in Ireland to travel onwards to Northern Ireland.</p><p>The UK authorities have also provided information for those travelling to Ireland from overseas via Northern Ireland. This guidance, which is available at the following link (www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-advice), advises that relevant passengers must fill out a UK PLF. </p><p>Ireland and the UK have remained in close contact at political and official level on our respective approaches to managing travel in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in relation to PLF requirements. Engagement takes place on both a North-South and East-West basis and has been highly productive. We will continue to prioritise all aspects of this dialogue in the period ahead. </p><p>More broadly, I want to see travel taking place within the CTA in as seamless a manner as possible, as soon as this is feasible and safe. The CTA plays a vital role in facilitating the way in which Irish and British people live, work and travel on and across these islands, and it will continue to underpin our bilateral relationship.</p></reply>

My programme did not include a meeting with President Abbas on this occasion. I discussed the designations in my meetings with Palestinian Prime Minister Shtayyeh and Deputy Prime Minister Abu Amr.</p>  <p>  Our partners in the EU are also aware of this matter, and have been in touch with the Israeli authorities to seek further clarification. As I have stated, in the absence of detailed evidence from the Israeli authorities to support the designations, Ireland will continue to support the organisations concerned.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been active on this matter at the UN Security Council, and we supported the holding of a discussion on the designation and the recent settlement announcements at the Council on 8 November. We made a joint press statement following the meeting with EU Member States, France and Estonia, joined by Norway and Albania. </p>  <p>  In this statement, we underlined our serious concern at this designation and the potential political, legal and financial consequences. This designation has the potential to impact, not only these six organisations, but civil society more broadly across the oPt and to seriously undermine vital humanitarian, development and human rights work.</p>  <p>  Civil society organisations and human rights defenders play a critical role in promoting international law, peace, human rights and democratic values.

These developments are deeply worrying for the people of Ethiopia, and raise questions regarding the stability of the Horn of Africa region as a whole.  </p>  <p>  Through our bilateral engagements, as well as within the European Union and at the UN Security Council, Ireland continues to advocate for urgent and unimpeded humanitarian access, a negotiated ceasefire, and political dialogue aimed at resolving the conflict.  </p>  <p>  I am alarmed by the conflict&rsquo;s impact on civilians, including harrowing reports of widespread and ongoing sexual violence, and other serious violations and abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law.   Accountability for violations of international law committed by all parties, including as described in the recent joint Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights/Ethiopian Human Rights Commission report, is essential.</p>  <p>  There has been a shocking rise in hate speech, arbitrary arrests and detentions, including of UN staff, and other acts likely to fuel tensions.  Human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms are universal and inalienable values that States must uphold.  No individual should be deprived of their liberty without legal authority, or without necessary procedural protections.</p>  <p>  It is clear there can be no military solution to this crisis.  I strongly support the efforts of African Union Envoy, former Nigerian President Obasanjo, and by President Kenyatta of Kenya to mediate a way forward.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been to the fore of efforts to address the conflict at the Security Council.  On 5 November, we secured agreement on the first Council statement in six months on the situation, which called for a cessation of hostilities and ceasefire negotiations, alongside respect of international humanitarian law, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, the re-establishment of public services, and the scaling up of humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  We continue to push for a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis. At the Foreign Affairs Council in October and again last week, Minister Coveney emphasised the need to ensure humanitarian access, to halt the fighting, and to incentivise dialogue &mdash;including through possible use of restrictive measures if required. </p>  <p>  As the government blockade continues, famine-like conditions are being reported in Tigray and over 6.5 million people in northern Ethiopia are in need of humanitarian assistance. To date, Ireland has provided over &euro;4.4 million in humanitarian aid to Tigray and Amhara and for refugees in neighbouring Sudan. We will continue to prioritise humanitarian need while this crisis persists.</p></reply>

Public Health advice remains that asymptomatic children are at low risk for transmission. Schools are controlled settings and the approach to contact tracing is risk-based in relation to the setting, age-group and the existence of other preventive measures. Public Health doctors have advised that the on the ground experience has been and remains that schools are relatively low risk environments and have not been a driver of transmission in children over the course of the pandemic.   The household setting is the highest risk for transmission. </p>  <p>  Unvaccinated people of all ages who are household contacts of a case must restrict movements (and stay out of work or school) for 10 days and have a PCR test at day 0 and day 10.</p>  <p>  As of the 27th September 2021, a decision was taken by Government in line with recommendations from NPHET to cease routine contact tracing of asymptomatic close contacts in children older than 3 months to under 13 years outside of the household setting, including those attending primary educational and childcare settings. Contact tracing continues for those over 13 years, including those attending post primary schools.</p>  <p>  If there are particular outbreaks of concern in educational facilities, Public Health teams will continue to provide support to schools should it be required and testing will remain available more broadly to children should it be required on public health or clinical grounds or following a Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA), especially in special education settings. </p>  <p>  It remains very important to ensure no-one with new acute symptoms attend class, and that all recommended infection prevention and control measures are in place in line with school Covid response plans.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE, working in collaboration with the Department of Education has announced last week a programme in which antigen tests will be made available to children in primary schools.  These arrangements will not apply to staff in schools or children in post primary schools as existing contact tracing continues for those over 13 years.  </p>  <p>  Parents and Guardians of a primary school child, who is a confirmed case of COVID-19 following a PCR test, are asked to inform their school&rsquo;s principal. The school principal will then inform the parents of other children in the pod of a confirmed case. No personal details of the child will be shared. These parents will be provided with the option to receive free antigen tests for their child, which they will be able to order for delivery to their home.  </p>  <p>  It is important that parents inform principals quickly if a child receives a PCR &lsquo;detected&rsquo; test for Covid-19. By doing this, the choice to participate in antigen testing can be offered to other parents quickly. It is important that everyone continues to follow all the public health advice in using this new programme</p>  <p>  It is not mandatory for children to participate in antigen testing. Children who are in a pod where a child has tested positive for Covid-19 can continue to attend school, whether they participate in antigen testing or not. </p>  <p>  School principals will not be required to gather evidence of participation or of any antigen test results. Information materials for parents has been shared with schools and publicised directly to parents and this programme will commence shortly. </p></reply>

A decision on this application issued directly to the school authority. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the ASA scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom and Special Education Needs (SEN) accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school&rsquo;s existing accommodation.</p>  <p>  The immediate priority of my Department is providing new and replacement school places each year, to ensure that every child has a school place. Accordingly, the main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on the provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics.  The second half of the NDP will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock, including provision for ancillary accommodation such as GP rooms in primary schools.</p>  <p>  In the case of all new school building projects, however, I wish to advise the Deputy that the provision of a GP room forms part of the accommodation brief.  These facilities may also form part of the overall accommodation brief for major capital extensions to existing schools.

The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports</p><p>This policy is supported by significant investment by this Government.  Next year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs. </p><p>Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 386% from 548 to 2,118 for the 2021/2022 school year.  Of these 594 special classes are in post primary schools.  </p><p>Budget 2022 will provide for over 980 new teacher and 1,165 new SNAs posts for allocation to schools next year. </p><p>The 980 new teacher posts is broken down as follows:</p><p>- 620 of the new posts will provide additional support for children attending mainstream classes including new and expanding schools.</p><p>- 360 posts will facilitate the opening of 287 new special classes providing over 1,700 new places in 2022 and 140 new special school places.</p><p>Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for.</p><p>It is therefore not the case that special educational placements are required to support all children with special educational needs, nor is it intended that this should be the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>Through ongoing consultation with schools and parents at local level the NCSE is aware of students who will be seeking placement for the 22/23 academic year. I should also clarify that the NCSE does not maintain waiting lists for schools.  Boards of management of individual schools are responsible for such enrolment matters.</p><p>However, the NCSE, through its local network of SENOs (Special Educational Needs Organisers), offers advice and support to parents on the possible placement options available to their child, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement and special school placement.</p><p>All placements are supported with additional resources where required for those students with special educational needs.</p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need.  This process is ongoing. </p><p>My Department works in close collaboration with the NCSE to ensure that the necessary provision is put in place on a timely basis throughout the country.  </p><p>Parents seeking special class placements for their children are advised to contact their local SENO so that their needs can be taken into account for planning purposes.</p></reply>

In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including those of schools in south County Kildare, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming year(s) which may necessitate further action to that already in train.  The Deputy will appreciate that my Department typically engages with patron bodies in the first instance, rather than principals or Boards of Management, as patrons hold an important role in the overall education system. </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in this, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the school planning areas in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.  Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p>  <p>  A number of projects to deliver additional post primary shcool capacity in the south County Kildare area are planned or underway and a summary of these is below:</p>  <p>  Curragh Post Primary School - Roll number 70660O - Site Acquisition stage.</p>  <p>  It is intended that significant additional capacity to address demand will be provided by the planned new 1000 pupil building for the existing Curragh post primary school. This is intended to provide capacity to cater for demand arising in the Kildare School planning area as well as that in the Newbridge and Curragh SPAs. Officials in the Department are currently in advanced negotiation with a landowner, in regard to the proposed acquisition of a site deemed suitable for the replacement Curragh post primary school. This negotiation is ongoing, in line with our comprehensive site selection criteria, technical consideration and input from Kildare County Council.</p>  <p>  St Conleth's Community College - Roll number 70680U -  Patron has agreed to enrol an additional 1st year class for the 2021/22 school year and the expansion of the school to cater for a total capacity of 1,000 pupils.</p>  <p>  Cross &amp;amp; Passion College - Roll number 61690W - Stage 1. The accommodation brief for the major project for Cross and Passion College, Kilcullen has also been increased to cater for a 1,000 pupil school to provide for increased demographic growth</p></reply>

In urban areas, in particular, data relating to adjacent school planning areas is also used to inform our consideration of requirements. There are no current plans to revise school planning areas.</p>  <p>  The new post primary school to which the Deputy refers was announced in 2016 following a nationwide demographic analysis which identified an emerging demand at post primary level in the Stepaside School Planning Area.  </p>  <p>  All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise the enrolment of children from within the designated school planning areas which the school is being established to serve. However, it is important to note that this does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate, in the first instance, the demographic for which the school was established.  Once the school has been established, parents must apply directly to the school in relation to their child&rsquo;s enrolment in the normal way.</p></reply>

I am pleased to say that this has resulted in the biggest ever uptake of the programme during the summer period with the overall number of schools participating rising by 72% and the number of students by 60% over 2020. This is in addition to the supplementary programme run earlier in the year which had over 14,000 applicants.</p>  <p>  Our first priority for payment in 2021 was for the supplementary programme, for which claims were paid in August 2021. For the school based element all fully completed claim forms were paid on or before 7th October 2021, which was earlier than the previous year despite an 85% increase in the number of participants.</p>  <p>  For the home based element of the prgramme there was a significant increase in the number and complexity of claims involved  and while the majority were paid by the 28 October 2021, unfortunately there was a delay in some payments issuing.  The remaining fully complete claims will be paid in the next payroll run on 25 November. </p>  <p>  Claims are processed and paid when all outstanding queries are fully resolved. Where there are outstanding issues, claimants have been contacted directly with a view to resolving as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  The payment is decided by information provided on the application form in terms of whether a child is at Primary or Post Primary school and what qualification the Tutor has at the time of processing. Any queries in relation to taxation are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</p>  <p>  I wish to thank teachers and SNAs who participated in the expanded summer programme this year. Issue around payment dates will be taken account of in planning and resourcing next year&rsquo;s programme.</p></reply>

A review of the supply panels has taken place and approximately 100 additional teachers are being added to existing/new areas where significant challenges have been demonstrated in sourcing substitution.

Schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed.  </p><p>In addition to the expansion of the supply panels, schools with teaching principals have also been asked to cluster their allocation of principal release days to form a full-time fixed-term post to minimise the requirement for substitute teachers.</p><p>For the current school year, changes have been made to the career break scheme to permit teachers on career break to carry out unlimited substitute work. Changes have also been made to the job sharing scheme to permit job sharing teachers carry out substitute work on the days they are rostered off, in their own or in other schools. </p><p>The Teaching Council has undertaken a communications campaign to contact the over 111,000 teachers on its register to raise awareness to the current teacher substitute challenges and to ask availble teachers to register with<i>Sub Seeker</i>, so that their availability is known to schools seeking subs.</p><p>The Council and my Department have also engaged with higher education institutions, who have been requested bring flexibility to programme delivery to enhance the availability of PME student teachers to undertake substitute work.

In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in Malahide and Portmarnock school planning areas, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.   </p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, my Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector, in order to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in these, and other areas will reduce in the short-term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in the school planning areas in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at, www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.  Details of schools listed on this programme (the Additional Accommodation Scheme) can be found on my Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is also updated regularly.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department previously fully implemented and funded the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator for a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim and officials from the Department and school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the issues. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals.</p>  <p>  Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13th September, there has been significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale within education and training boards on a pro rata basis with an effective date of implementation for these new pay arrangements of 1st September 2021. Pay rates will be pro rata according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The assimilation of School Secretaries to the CO Grade III pay scale will require further dialogue between the parties and further engagement is taking place at present to allow this to be finalised.  My Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff and engagement has begun on this element.</p>  <p>  Discussions on these elements continue at present and should agreement on an overall package be reached then Forsa would have to ballot their members and an implementation process would then begin if the ballot was passed. Therefore actual implementation and payment of any agreed pay improvements is still some time away. However as set out above the pay element of the offer includes an effective implementation date of 1 September 2021 should agreement be reached.</p>  <p>  I welcomed the deferral of the action scheduled for Wednesday 15th September and I encourage all parties to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

The report recommends that Irish Sign Language (ISL) qualified assistants should be put in place to support profoundly deaf students whose primary language is ISL and that this should be aligned to the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017. This recommendation is under consideration at present. </p>  <p>  In the interim these posts are filled, on a case by case basis, through the NCSE to allocate an additional SNA post with appropriate ISL qualifications.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education has allocated a post to a small number of schools who have students enrolled with significant hearing impairments as confirmed by professional reports.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of these posts is to enable these students attend school and access the curriculum and these staff are employed on similar terms and conditions to SNAs. There are no plans to change this interim arrangement.</p>  <p>  Generally, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, when a school is recruiting an SNA, the board of management should ensure that the SNA recruited is equipped with the skills necessary to support the particular needs of the pupils for whom SNA support have been appointed. </p>  <p>  The terms and conditions including pay of SNAs is determined centrally as part of a national process and it not something that can be addressed outside of these arrangements.</p>  <p>  Planning is underway for the development of the schemes required under the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 in consultation with the NCSE. Arising from this work, any necessary amendments to current level of supports for students whose primary means of communication is ISL will be made.</p></reply>

These will be examined for the first time in summer 2022.</p>  <p>  Post Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) have been charged by the Department with supporting schools in the implementation of the new languages.  Three recognised post primary schools are delivering the Leaving Certificate Mandarin Chinese curriculum.  PPLI has six teachers of Mandarin Chinese who are deployed to deliver Mandarin Chinese in twenty schools including the Leaving Certificate curriculum to the three participating schools, Junior Cycle (4 schools) and Transition Year (20 schools).  It is anticipated that some of the schools delivering the Junior Cycle and Transition Year programmes will go on to deliver the Leaving Certificate programme over the coming years.</p>  <p>  PPLI is also providing the two year Leaving Certificate Mandarin Chinese programme through Saturday classes for students whose schools do not have the numbers required to provide the programme.  Eighty Seven (87) students are currently availing of these classes in Dublin and Cork, forty six (46) in year one of the programme and thirty one (31) in year two.</p>  <p>  Additional schools may be offering Transition Year Mandarin Chinese through Irish and migrant Chinese teachers as well as tutors from Confucius Institutes.</p>  <p>  PPLI has hosted information sessions to over 500 students and parents in early 2021 to introduce the new curriculum. PPLI will continue to host some more sessions between November and December on 1) the specification, 2) portfolio guidelines and 3) the sample paper. This will be for students who are taking Mandarin Chinese outside of school, and will include some tips on self-study (not exam preparation) and will take place once the sample paper has been published. The student and/or parent can get in touch with PPLI info@PPLI.ie for more information.</p>  <p>  The Department has been in regular contact with the Teaching Council regarding the publication of registration criteria for Lithuanian, Mandarin Chinese, Polish and Portuguese teachers.  It is expected that the criteria will be available early in 2022.</p></reply>

A 10 year allocation for the period 2021 to 2030 was not provided for individual Departments under the revised NDP.  There will be a rolling 5 year funding envelope which will be updated annually for the period 2026 to 2030 within the Government&rsquo;s overall NDP funding envelope of &euro;136 billion in exchequer capital (&euro;165 billion total capital including non-Exchequer) and will facilitate building a modern and sustainable school infrastructure</p>  <p>  This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs.  This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p>  <p>  Approximately 1,200 school building projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction &ndash; most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period 2021 to 2025. </p>  <p>  During the period 2018 to 2020 526 school building projects were completed under the Large Scale Capital Programme (LSCP) and the Additional School Accommodation Scheme (ASA).  These projects delivered in excess of 48,000 school places</p>  <p>  There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage.

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. </p><p>A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website.</p><p>The Expert Group in its report notes &ldquo;<i>very good advice is contained in the Department of Education&rsquo;s Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools</i>&rdquo;</p><p>And that &ldquo;<i>It must be emphasized that ventilation should be delivered as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.&rdquo;</i></p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p><p>The Expert Group also note &ldquo;<i>consider</i><i>using a portable carbon dioxide (CO</i><i><sub>2</sub></i><i>) monitor to identify areas of the school with inadequate ventilation</i>. The Department's guidance outlines CO<sub>2</sub>monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO<sub>2</sub>monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. </p><p>In excess of 35,400 monitors were delivered to Primary and Post Primary schools nationwide, between 2 and 20 for schools at primary level and between 20 and 35 for schools at post-primary level depending on school size, at a cost of circa &euro;4 million.</p><p>Dublin Central: <table>    <tr>       <th>Roll_Number</th>       <th>School_Name</th>       <th>Number of   Monitors</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>00752A</td>       <td>CENTRAL SENIOR MXD N   S</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01795A</td>       <td>CENTRAL INFS SCHOOL</td>       <td>7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>05933G</td>       <td>PRESENTATION PRIMARY   SCHOOL</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>09932B</td>       <td>STANHOPE ST CONVENT</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>11525A</td>       <td>ST PATRICKS N SCHOOL</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>12448N</td>       <td>GARDINER STREET   CONVENT</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>14463T</td>       <td>ST COLUMBAS N S MXD</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>14980Q</td>       <td>GLASNEVIN N S</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>15056L</td>       <td>S N SAN VINSEANN   CAILIN</td>       <td>9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>15816I</td>       <td>ST VINCENTS INF BOYS</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>15895H</td>       <td>DRUMCONDRA N S</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>16177F</td>       <td>LINDSAY ROAD N S</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>16577V</td>       <td>ST BRIGIDS CONVENT</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>16659A</td>       <td>ST COLUMBAS CON G   &amp;amp;

Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department.</p><p>Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.</p><p>The Department's Guidance is clear that where the recommended measures in the Practical Steps and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available. This is line with Expert Group guidance which identifies that in areas with poor ventilation that structural interventions and measures to increase natural ventilation should be completed. Where such structural interventions or measures are not possible in the short term, that consideration should be given to using stand-alone HEPA filter devices in poorly ventilated spaces pending the completion of structural interventions.</p><p>There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. If, following consultation with a supplier a school feels that its individual space may require specific technical specialist advice then the assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect can be sought.</p><p>A Minor Works Grant was provided to all schools to fund ventilation improvements as necessary and funding continues to be available under the Emergency Works Scheme to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.</p><p>In 2021, 13 schools applied for additional funding under the emergency works scheme to assist with ventilation. Of these, two applications were from Rutland NS in Dublin Central. One was not approved due to an incomplete application, the other was approved.</p></reply>

The decisions taken by Government about Leaving Certificate 2021, in the context of the impact on teaching and learning of the Covid-19 pandemic, were taken with the best interests of students in mind. </p>  <p>  The NCCA&rsquo;s Senior Cycle Review: Advisory Report has been submitted to me for consideration and will be published once that consideration process is complete. Those considerations are being progressed with the best interests of students in mind. </p>  <p>  The Advisory Report maps out, in broad terms, an ambitious programme of work, which would enable the development and construction of the components that would make up a Framework for Senior Cycle and will involve further ongoing stakeholder engagement and consultation. The voices of students have contributed to the Advisory Report and will again be heard in those further engagements and consultations.</p>  <p>  Regarding examinations in 2022, adjusted assessment arrangements for students taking Leaving Certificate examinations next year were issued last August in advance of the start of the school year. These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the Covid-19 pandemic by incorporating adjustments in a manner similar to the initial adjustments that were made for the students taking examinations in 2021.</p>  <p>  I and my Department officials are keenly aware of the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our education system over the past two years, including its impact on students who were due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in those years.  I expect that the lessons to be learnt from the pandemic will be considered and where appropriate, will assist in informing the redevelopment of Senior Cycle.</p></reply>

Equipment is provided under this scheme for children with more complex disabilities who, in order to access the school curriculum, require essential specialist equipment which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the school&rsquo;s existing IT provision.  </p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Education Needs Officers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for assistive technology support. </p><p>Schools make applications directly to the SENO, providing details of the student&rsquo;s special educational needs or disability, including details of the approach taken by the school in making relevant interventions. Professional reports (from psychologists or occupational therapists, for example) must be submitted by the school along with the application. These reports must have a recent and comprehensive professional assessment of the nature and extent of disability, and outline that the equipment is essential for the pupil to access the curriculum.</p><p>Equipment may only be provided where medical and/or other professional reports outline that the degree of communicative disability is such that this equipment is essential to allow the pupil to access education and set out how the equipment will provide for this. </p><p>The type of equipment provided under the assistive technology scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.</p><p>Communication devices or medical or therapy related devices which are not specific educational interventions, or equipment specifically required as essential for school educational access, that have a general application outside of school, which are normally provided for children with disabilities by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and which are provided for through the HSE Aids and Appliances scheme are not provided for under this scheme.</p><p>SENOs review the application and professional reports, in order to establish whether the criteria of the scheme have been met. A recommendation is then made to my Department as to whether or not assistive technology is required; and based on this recommendation, my Department decides on the level of grant, if any, to be provided.</p><p>In the majority of applications &euro;550.00 is the maximum amount of grant payable by my Department for a Laptop as this level of grant aid is sufficient for most assistive technology educational software in Primary and Post Primary schools. However in exceptional cases my officials can grant in excess of this amount. Such cases can arise when a pupil may need high level visual aids such as magnifying reading devices and braille equipment, or a pupil may have a high level of need with mobility.</p><p>It is open to parents to contact SENOs directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available at: <i>ncse.ie/seno-contact-list</i></p><p>It is anticipated that work in relation to reviewing the assistive technology scheme will commence in 2022.</p></reply>

Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.</p>  <p>  The Department previously fully implemented and funded the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator for a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim and officials from the Department and school management bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the issues. On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p>  <p>Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13 September, there has been significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale within education and training boards on a pro rata basis with an effective date of implementation for these new pay arrangements of 1 September 2021. Pay rates will be pro rata according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The assimilation of School Secretaries to the CO Grade III pay scale will require further dialogue between the parties and further engagement is taking place at present to allow this to be finalised.   My Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff and engagement has begun on this element.</p>  <p>  While there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. When the final package for secretaries has been agreed and an implementation plan in place for schools and DE, that intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p>  <p>  I welcomed the deferral of the action scheduled for Wednesday 15th September and I encourage all parties to focus on finalising an agreement.</p></reply>

In the 2020/21 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020.  </p>  <p>  Planning for school transport scheme services for the 2021/22 school year proceeded on the basis that the public health measures in place as schools closed at the end of the last school year would remain as the term began in this new school year. This included the operation of post-primary services at 50% capacity, in addition to hygiene measures and the wearing of masks on-board.  The Department has kept this position under review as the vaccination programme for children on post-primary services was rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeded. </p>  <p>  In line with the lifting of restrictions on public transport, and with effect from the return of schools following the October mid-term break, implementation commenced for post-primary school transport services to resume operating at 100% capacity.  This process will take a period of time to re-organise and re-schedule services and communications will be issued to families regarding any revised arrangements.  </p>  <p>  All other measures relating to hygiene, pre-assigned seating, cleaning and the wearing of masks by post-primary students will remain in place subject to further review. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide funding for all additional hygiene measures required on school transport services.</p></reply>

These guidelines, are available on my Department's web-site at gov.ie/en/publication/7e515-technical-guidance-documents. In primary schools, a mainstream classroom of 80m&sup2; in area is provided in the design of new school buildings and extensions to existing buildings. At post primary level, specifications vary with the purpose of the classroom. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme is to ensure that essential mainstream classroom and Special Education Needs (SEN) accommodation is available to cater for pupils enrolled each year, where the need cannot be met by the school&rsquo;s existing accommodation.  </p>  <p>  The main focus of resources over the last decade and for the coming period is on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics. The second half of the National Development Plan will see an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock.  </p>  <p>  Schools can also avail of funding in respect of their accommodation under the Annual Minor Works Grant or the Summer Works Scheme.  </p>  <p>   The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account, for example, classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.</p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government there is a commitment to seek to make further progress in reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools. </p>  <p>  At primary level, the annual staffing schedule determines the allocation of teachers to schools. The current allocation is on an average ratio of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils.  Budget 2022 has implemented a further 1 point reduction for the 2022/23 school year so that primary schools will be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of 1 classroom teacher for every 24 pupils in September 2022.  Lower thresholds apply to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools.</p>  <p>  This Budget measure has brought the teacher allocation ratio in all primary schools to the lowest ever seen at primary level.  This is the second successive Budget which has seen an improvement in allocation of teachers to primary schools.</p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio shows an improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 16:1 to 14.5:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2020/21 school year.  This compares favourably with the OECD pupil teacher ratio which is 1:15. In the same period the staffing schedule improved from 28:1 to 25:1 for this school year. </p>  <p>  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 23.3 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes for this school year, and statistics on this will be published later in the year.</p></reply>

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. </p><p>A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. </p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. </p><p>The guidance outlines that Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO2 monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. Over 35,000 monitors have been dispatched to schools nationwide.</p><p>A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department.</p><p>Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.  </p></reply>

The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are at unprecedented levels. </p><p>Very significant levels of financial provision are made to ensure that children with special educational needs, including those in Kildare, can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs. </p><p>The State currently spends in excess of 25% of its annual education and training budget (&euro;9.2 Billion) on making additional provision for children with special educational needs.</p><p>This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided.</p><p>Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 386% from 548 to 2,118 for the 2021/2022 school year.  Of these 1,524 special classes are in primary schools. </p><p>Budget 2022 announced details of &euro;9.2 billion in funding for education and includes funding for an additional 1,165 SNAs (in 2022) to provide support to children with special educational needs, which will bring the total number of SNAs to 19,169 at the end of December 2022.This represents an increase of 81% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide, including schools in Kildare. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, to meet identified need. This process is ongoing.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialized provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p><p>Budget 2022 provides for an additional 360 special class teachers in 2022, which will provide for over 1,700 special class places.  126 special schools provide specialist education for approximately 7,500 pupils annually with over 1,400 teachers.  Two new special schools have also opened recently, one in Dublin and one in Cork. </p><p>There are now over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.  </p><p>This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9,740 teachers were allocated. </p><p>Budget 2022 provides for the creation 980 new teaching posts in special education.  This new investment is required to meet the needs of students with special educational needs enrolled in mainstream classes; students to be enrolled in new special classes and new special school places and the needs of new and developing schools.  </p><p>The new allocation is broken down as follows:</p><p>- 620 of the new posts will provide additional support for children attending mainstream classes including new and expanding schools</p><p>- 360 posts will facilitate the opening of 287 new special classes providing over 1,700 new places in 2022 and 140 new special school places  </p><p>A new model for allocating special education teachers in respect of students with special needs enrolled in mainstream classes was introduced in 2017.  The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.  The profile of each school takes account of enrolments and a number of other factors that are considered to be indicative of the level of need in each school. There is a commitment to update profiles on a regular basis with the last update being for the 2019/20 school.</p><p>In addition, there is a provision for schools to seek additionality through the Exceptional Needs Review process if there is a significant change in their level of need in between profile updates. </p><p>The additional 620 SET posts will be allocated to schools based on updated SET school profiles in 2022.</p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2021/22 school year. </p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. </p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>The allocation of 1,165 SNAs announced in Budget 2022 is to meet the care needs of pupils in 2022 and will enable the establishment of new special classes, creation of new places in special schools, support children in mainstream classes for the 2022/23 school year.</p><p>Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools</p><p>Circular 0029/2021 has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year. SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p></reply>

There have been a number of positive measures implemented to support this approach including an improvement of one point in the appointment threshold in primary schools which has been introduced for this school year. Schools are now provided with class teachers on the basis of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils which is a historical low ratio.  In addition, a three point reduction in the number of students required to retain a teacher has also been introduced for September 2021.  These measures will also help to ensure that less pupils are required to recruit or retain a teacher.</p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the overall allocation of teaching posts and specific targeted measures for small and isolated schools as well as primary schools on our islands. </p>  <p>  In August I launched the Small Schools Clusters Action Research Project which is an innovative research project which aims to encourage small schools in a number of clusters to collaborate together and identify common challenges and trial innovative solutions.

The act increases the transparency and fairness of school admissions. It makes clear that every school must be welcoming of every young person regardless of their colour, their abilities or disabilities. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.</p>  <p>  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary and it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice. </p>  <p>  All schools have drafted admission policies that were applied for the first time for enrolment in September 2021, which are published on individual school websites. The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. Schools and their Patrons have discretion in relation to their admission criteria and how they are applied, once it is non-discriminatory and fair.  It is an important feature of the act that schools can only make a decision on an application for admission that is based on the schools admission policy.  </p></reply>

This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland.</p><p>This investment will build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs.  This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>Approximately 1,200 school building projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction &ndash; most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period 2021 to 2025. </p><p>There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage. These are being progressed as quickly as possible. </p><p><b>During the period 2018 to 2020 526 school building projects were completed</b>under the Large Scale Capital Programme (LSCP) and the Additional School Accommodation Scheme (ASA).  These projects delivered in excess of <b>48,000 school places</b>. <b>16</b>of these projects delivered were in County Kildare; <b>13</b>of those were primary schools including one special school and <b>3</b>were post-primary school building projects.  </p><p>In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System, using data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. </p><p>The most recent analysis undertaken by my Department projects that over 60% of the 314 school planning areas at primary level have stable or decreasing projected enrolments for the period to 2024, whereas some 90% of the school planning areas at post-primary level are anticipated to have increased enrolments for the period to 2027.</p><p>The level of demand volume across school planning areas with an increasing net requirement ranges from small to medium increases that are likely to be accommodated by existing schools through to significant projected growth that may require additional provision. </p><p>Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools. </p><p>My Department's most recent projections do not indicate significant increases in school place requirements at primary level in the Prosperous_Clane school planning area. </p><p>The projections at post-primary level indicate the projected peak year is 2025 with projected enrolment numbers of 1731, decreasing thereafter. </p><p>Clane is located in the Prosperous_Clane school planning area.

However, my Department has a key role in supporting quality within the sector and works closely with DCEDIY.  </p><p>My Department's main intervention in the provision of early years education is the Early Start programme and the Rutland Street Project. The Early Start programme was established in 1994, and is a one-year intervention to meet the needs of children aged between 3 years and 5 years who are at risk of not reaching their potential within the school system. It involves an educational programme to enhance overall development, help prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage.  The Early Start programme runs in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage, and has capacity for 1,620 children each year.  Early Start units are staffed by teachers and child care workers, and the role of the child care workers is to meet the care needs of all the children in the unit, including those children with special educational needs.  The programme opens each year to new child enrolments.  The Rutland Street Project was established in 1969 and informed many of the approaches to Early Start. It is supported by my Department and provides 103 places for preschool-aged children including an ASD Early Intervention Unit/Special Class.</p><p>Since the inception of Early Start, the early childhood education and care landscape has changed significantly with the introduction of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme in 2010, and the extension of this scheme to a two-year programme in 2018.  In the 2019/20 programme year over 105,000 children were supported in the ECCE scheme. The ECCE scheme is under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and officials of my Department and its agencies co-operate closely with that Department, particularly in relation to <i>S&iacute;olta </i>and <i>Aistear</i>, the national quality and curriculum frameworks for early childhood education.  </p><p>My Department also plays a key role in the ongoing development of the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) which was launched in June 2016 by DCEDIY. AIM is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the ECCE scheme.  AIM supports are provided through the ECCE scheme.  The main supports are grouped into universal or targeted supports. Where universal supports are not enough to meet the needs of an individual child, targeted supports are available to ensure that he or she can meaningfully participate in pre-school. </p><p>My Department has made provision for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classes for children of pre-school age for whom places aren&rsquo;t available from providers of the ECCE scheme. These early intervention (EI) classes are attached to mainstream schools.  There are currently 132 of these ASD EI classes across the country providing targeted supports for 695 pupils.  Moreover, where places in those classes are not currently available to pupils my Department provides Home Tuition grants to enable access to pre-school education for those children. In the last school year there were 522 pre-school children being supported by the Home Tuition scheme.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate has an oversight role regarding the quality of education provision for children and young people aged from 0 to 18 years. The quality improvement agenda has been further supported by the introduction of education inspections in Early Learning and Care settings delivering the ECCE programme of free preschool since 2016. The first early years education inspection (EYEI) reports were published in June 2016 on the Department of Education website. To date over 2,600 EYEI reports have been completed in a diverse range of early years settings nationally. The Inspectorate evaluates the quality of the nature, range and appropriateness of the early educational experiences for children participating in the ECCE programme. In 2019, <i>First Five, a Whole&ndash;of- Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families </i>was published including a range of commitments by my Department to improve the quality of early childhood education provision and practice. This includes the extension of education inspection of all state-funded ELC provision for children from birth. Officials in my Department recently launched a consultation on a revised Early Years Education Inspection Model which includes children from birth to three years old. </p></reply>

The number of teachers including substitute teachers employed in primary schools and paid by my Department on the 11th of November 2021 was 47,175. </p>  <p>  The overall number of teaching posts is determined by an allocation process. The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts to schools is published annually on the Department website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.</p>  <p>   The current allocation is on an average ratio of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils.  Budget 2022 has implemented a further 1 point reduction for the 2022/23 school year so that primary schools will be allocated teaching posts on an average basis of 1 classroom teacher for every 24 pupils in September 2022.  Lower thresholds apply to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools.</p>  <p>  This Budget measure has brought the teacher allocation ratio in all primary schools to the lowest ever seen at primary level.  This is the second successive Budget which has seen an improvement in allocation of teachers to primary schools.</p>  <p>  An additional range of measures have been put in place to provide enhanced substitute cover in the context of COVID-19. These include a major expansion of the primary schools substitute teacher supply panels, which now employ almost 380 teachers and provide substitute cover to over 2,500 primary schools across the country. </p>  <p>  The supply panels&rsquo; work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as sub seeker, the national substitution portal service for primary and post primary schools, operated by the Irish primary principal&rsquo;s network (IPPN). Schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed. </p>  <p>  Measures are also underway to raise awareness of the availability of substitute work in schools. The Teaching Council register of teachers currently has over 111,000 teachers and the Council has emailed all teachers on the register asking any who may be available for substitute work to register with sub seeker.</p>  <p>  For the current school year, changes have been made to the career break scheme to permit teachers on career break to carry out unlimited substitute work. Changes have also been made to the job sharing scheme to permit job sharing teachers carry out substitute work on the days they are rostered off.</p></reply>

The criteria for the allocation of posts are communicated to school managements annually and are available on the Department website.</p>  <p>  At primary level, the annual staffing schedule which determines the allocation of teachers to schools is now based on an average ratio of 1 classroom teacher for every 25 pupils.

Lower thresholds apply to DEIS Urban Band 1 schools.  This Budget measure has brought the teacher allocation ratio in all primary schools to the lowest ever seen at primary level. </p>  <p>  At post primary level, teachers are currently allocated at a ratio of 19:1 in the free education system and 23:1 to schools in the fee charging sector.     </p>  <p>  As part of COVID-19 operational supports, 1,000 additional teachers have been allocated to post-primary schools to help reduce class sizes.  A teacher allocation equivalent to a pupil teacher ratio reduction of 0.6 has been allocated to schools in the free scheme.  This allocation supports the important work of teaching and learning and provide additional teachers needed to support teacher substitution, management of physical distancing requirements by reallocating class timetables in schools to smaller groups class sizes where necessary.  These posts will also provide for management supports.  In addition an allocation, equivalent to a pupil teacher ratio reduction of 0.1 has been provided in respect of Guidance provision to support student wellbeing. </p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>Budget 2022 announced details of &euro;9.2 billion in funding for education and includes funding for an additional 1,165 SNAs (in 2022) to provide support to children with special educational needs, which will bring the total number of SNAs to 19,169 at the end of December 2022.This represents an increase of 81% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.</p><p>Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website ncse.ie/for-schools</p><p>The NCSE manages the exceptional review process and handles each case individually. Some review requests can be concluded as an office based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited in order to observe the current deployment of SNA support in the school setting.</p><p>The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p><p>The SNA exceptional review considers the overall profile of needs in the school and is not specific to individual students.</p><p>The NCSE have confirmed that during the 2020/2021 school year a total of 778 schools were provided with an increase in mainstream SNA support following an SNA exceptional review. To the end of October 2021, a total of 251 schools have so far received an increased mainstream SNA allocation for the 2021/2022 school year on completion of an SNA exceptional review. </p><p>There were a total of 143 appeals of the outcome of the SNA exceptional review process for the 2020/2021 school year. Of these 27 were upheld. There have, so far, been a total of 131 appeals for the 2021/2022 school year. Of these 5 have so far been upheld. </p><p>There are now over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.  </p><p>This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9,740 teachers were allocated. </p><p>Budget 2022 provides for the appointment of 620 new special education teachers (SETs) to support pupils with special educational needs in mainstream classes.  This allocation also covers the needs of new and developing schools.  </p><p>Since the commencement of the 2017/2018 school year schools have been provided with a Special Education Teaching allocation based on the profile of needs in the school. Schools do not apply for Resource Teaching hours for individual students and have not been required to do so since 2016.</p><p>The allocations have remained in place for the 2019/20 and 2020/21 school years, with some adjustments made over the course of the model for schools which achieved developing status, or successfully appealed on the grounds of exceptional circumstances arising in their schools. Allocations are also provided for new schools which open each year.</p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile.  </p><p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review, they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie/for-schools </p><p><b>Details of the SNA appeals received in each month are set out in the following table.</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>2020/2021 school year</th>       <th>Appeals received</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jun-20</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jul-20</td>       <td>48</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Aug-20</td>       <td>11</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sep-20</td>       <td>10</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Oct-20</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nov-20</td>       <td>20</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dec-20</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jan-21</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Feb-21</td>       <td>3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mar-21</td>       <td>5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Apr-21</td>       <td>4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May-21</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021/2022 school year</td>       <td>Appeals received</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jun-21</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jul-21</td>       <td>35</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Aug-21</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sep-21</td>       <td>28</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Oct-21</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Nov-21</td>       <td>8</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Reviews of SET allocations</b></p><p>In relation to the applications for a review of the SET allocation to schools since 2019 the NCSE have stated that, </p><p>- 278 requests from schools  for review of their SET allocations were received. </p><p>- 233 applications did not  meet the criteria for review and have been notified of this decision. </p><p>- 45 applications to date met  the criteria for review;</p><p>- 19 schools were allocated an  increase in SET hours</p><p>- 23 schools have been  scheduled for review in September/October.</p></reply>

The Department has continued to support CE schemes throughout the period and introduced a number of emergency measures including the extension of CE participants&rsquo; contracts when necessary. </p>  <p>  Together with Minister Humphreys, I announced further funding for contract extensions to 4th February 2022 for existing CE and T&uacute;s participants.  These final contract extensions will provide existing CE participants with additional time to complete their training and benefit from work experience, which may have been adversely affected by public health restrictions. The planned exits will be carried out on a coordinated and phased basis from February 2022.  This phased exit approach will support the recruitment of new CE participants while ensuring the ongoing delivery of important local community services.  </p>  <p>   It is important to note that one of the measures included in the Pathways to Work Strategy announced by Government in July, 2021 was an increase in the capacity of the Public Employment Service in Intreo Offices and contracted services to further support jobseekers through the provision of job search advice and assistance. These additional resources will be central to meeting the increased demand for employment support services arising from the impact of the pandemic, including the referral of new candidates to fill existing CE vacancies.  </p>  <p>  CE sponsoring authorities are encouraged by the Department to continue to promote the benefits of CE in their local communities.  Jobseekers interested in participating on CE can also contact a case officer in their Intreo Centre who will refer eligible candidates to local CE schemes.  The Department officials are continuing to work with local CE sponsoring authorities to identify suitable CE candidates. </p>  <p>  CE sponsoring authorities can also advertise vacancies on www.jobsireland.ie, the Department&rsquo;s online job advertising and recruitment service for jobseekers and employers. </p>  <p>  CE participants over the age of 62 can participate on a continuous basis up to the state pension age on the CE Service Support Stream.   Up to 10% of CE places are allocated to the Service Support Stream and there are 1,400 CE participants currently availing of the stream; there are approximately 500 places currently available nationally. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants, CE will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, including those whose employment has been impacted by COVID-19.  </p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for CE, including the length of time persons can participate on CE, are kept under active review by my Department officials to ensure the best outcomes for individual participants and to support the vital community services delivered by schemes.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made to fill vacancies, and Case Officers would be in contact with CE Supervisors in regard to any CE vacancy advertised to identify potential participants.  As time spent on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment counts towards eligibility there is expected to be an extra pool of potential participants once they transition to a Jobseeker payment.</p>  <p>  In respect of Fr Casey&rsquo;s \ Templeglantine GAA CE Scheme the CE Co-ordinator has written to 15 clients who meet the eligibility criteria in respect of the current vacancies in that scheme.</p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approx. 1,012,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is &euro;95 million.</p>  <p>  In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit. </p>  <p>  While I am aware of the campaign by Epilepsy Ireland, extending the free travel scheme to people with epilepsy during the period in which they are disallowed from driving cannot be considered in isolation.  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to a person with any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.</p>  <p>  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and, accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.  </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Governing Contribution Year is the second last complete tax year, for example, for a claim in 2021 the second last complete tax year is 2019. </p>  <p>  The attribution of contributions in respect of periods impacted by the pandemic is intended to ensure that persons entitled to and in receipt of certain Covid-19 income supports, including PUP, will not be disadvantaged in accessing social insurance benefits in the future.  </p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the measure makes provision for the  Minister for Social Protection, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and having considered certain matters set out in the legislation, to prescribe the number of self-employment contributions to be attributed to a self-employed contributor.  </p>  <p>  A self-employed contributor has a period of time following the end of the contribution year to remit and pay his or her social insurance liability for that contribution year.  For example, self-employed contributors have until the end of October 2021 to file their self-assessment tax returns for 2020, including the payment of social insurance contributions where they are liable to do so for that year.</p>  <p>  Once data on the social insurance returns made by self-employed workers in respect of 2020 are available towards the end of this year or early in 2022, I and my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be in a position to prescribe, as appropriate, the number of self-employment contributions required to protect the social insurance entitlements of self-employed workers who were in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment in 2020 and who were not in a position to discharge their social insurance liability for that year.</p></reply>

In assessing income from the insurable employment for the purposes of the One-Parent Family Payment or Jobseeker's Transitional payment, items such as PRSI contributions and pension contributions are deducted from gross earnings. Thereafter, the first &euro;165 per week of earnings from insurable employment is disregarded and half of the balance is assessed as means.</p>  <p>  Where a person is in receipt of maintenance payments, half of the amount received is assessed as means.  In addition, there is a housing disregard of &euro;95.23 per week.

This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system. </p><p>The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.  Appropriate certification is required to support any claim for payment.  There are no waiting days in respect of the enhanced illness benefit payment.  Only a single PRSI contribution from employment in the previous 4 weeks is required, making the payment very accessible for all employees.</p><p>I would like to confirm that my Department treats a medical Certificate of Incapacity for Work for someone self-isolating in exactly the same way as a certificate for someone restricting their movements.  Once my officials receive the appropriate documentation and people meet the eligibility and medical criteria, they are entitled to the enhanced illness benefit payment of &euro;350 a week, with increases for dependants if appropriate.  </p><p>Expenditure on the enhanced illness benefit was &euro;57 million in 2020, in addition to &euro;593 million spent on standard illness benefit.  Expenditure on enhanced illness benefit was almost &euro;80 million up to 12 November. </p><p>My Department will continue to monitor the public health situation and the effectiveness of income supports during this time.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.</p>  <p>  The main income supports to family carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant. The estimated expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2021 is approximately &euro;953 million. Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2021 is estimated to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion. </p>  <p>  My Department has recently received the suggestion proposed regarding the introduction of a Benefit of Work Estimator specific to the carer&rsquo;s income supports. The proposal would have to considered in the context of a range of factors such as IT resources, development costs and potential demand and usage. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the current income disregard and means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the most generous within the social welfare system. The amount of weekly earnings disregarded is &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple. By comparison, the income disregard applied to Disability Allowance is &euro;140 per week. For Jobseeker's Allowance, it is &euro;20 per day up to a maximum of &euro;60, and the balance is assessed at 60%. For Jobseeker's Transitional Payment, the weekly income disregard is &euro;165 with 50% of the balance assessed as means. A carer may also engage in employment, self-employment (and/or education or training) for a maximum of 18.5 hours per week.</p>  <p>  I recently announced measures as part of Budget 2022, which will allow carers to have a higher weekly household income, as well as a higher level of savings, and still qualify for a Carer&rsquo;s Allowance payment, as follows:</p>  <p>  - From next June, the income disregarded in the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will increase to &euro;350 for a single person, and to &euro;750 for a couple. </p>  <p>  - In addition, the amount of capital disregarded in the means test will be increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000. </p>  <p>  - From January 2022 the maximum weekly rate of Carer's Allowance will also increase by &euro;5 with proportional increases people on reduced rates of payment.</p>  <p>  I will continue to keep the range of income supports provided to family carers by this Department under review and will ensure that consultations with carer&rsquo;s representative groups continue so that the overall objectives of the carer income support schemes provided are met. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, I have asked my officials to examine the merits of the proposal outlined by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

My Department has commenced procuring a restructured and expanded activation service. This new model will see the replacement of Local Employment Services and JobClubs with a new Regional Employment Services model. This procurement process follows extensive consultations by my Department with existing service providers over the last number of years. The new model will extend high quality employment services across the State, deliver enhanced governance arrangements and provide successful tenderers with greater flexibility to innovate and deliver services for their clients. Phase 1 of this process in expanding services in the North West and Midlands is at an advanced stage.</p>  <p>  Phase Two will see the Regional Employment Service model rolled out across the State and will take on board the learnings from the first phase. This is a significant expansion of employment services and will result in State-wide coverage of employment services for those furthest from the labour market for the first time.</p>  <p>  Services tendered for in Phase two of this procurement process are to be in place by July 2022. This additional time will allow potential tenderers to prepare quality bids for the new services. My Department is in the process of offering current Local Employment Service and Job Club providers, in the Phase two areas, a new contract for the first half of 2022. This will enable continuity of service to our customers, providing for an orderly transition to the new employment services. </p>  <p>  Also, under &lsquo;Pathways to Work 2021 - 2025&rsquo;, the Government's new employment services strategy, which launched in July 2021, my Department has put in place a wide range of other supports to assist those out of work to find new jobs. These measures, strengthened by increased capacity within the Public Employment Service, will provide those out of work with the guidance and support they need to re-enter the workforce during the recovery phase of the pandemic. This includes persons who were unemployed prior to the pandemic and those whose pre-COVID jobs will not return post pandemic, who will require support and assistance finding new employment.</p>  <p>  Pathways to Work sets out 83 commitments on a whole-of-Government basis, many of which increase places on activation schemes. Eligible unemployed persons can be referred to these programmes by Intreo Activation services, including contracted services such as local employment services. These include; </p>  <p>  - A paid Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP), which is a 6-month, 30 hour per week work experience programme, to provide 10,000 unemployed people with the opportunity to build valuable on-the-job experience by the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  - Provision of an extra 3,000 places on State Employment Schemes such as Community Employment to support long term unemployed persons, particularly those facing the greatest barriers, get back to work.</p>  <p>  - Improved access to self-employment opportunities through increased funding for the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance scheme, supporting 4,200 jobseekers to start their own business.</p>  <p>  - Increased funding for JobsPlus recruitment subsidies with a value ranging from &euro;7,500 to &euro;10,000 for employers to benefit 8,000 jobseekers, with a particular focus on young unemployed people and people who are long-term unemployed.</p>  <p>  In addition, I am working closely with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, to ensure that jobseekers can avail of suitable training opportunities to assist them to access the skills needed to make their next step in their career. Under Pathways to Work, Minister Harris&rsquo;s Department is committed to providing 50,000 additional education and training places,</p>  <p>  Under Pathways to Work, my Department has also;</p>  <p>  - Improved access to further education and opportunities through increased funding for the Back to Education scheme, with a target of increasing participation in education programmes to 7,700.</p>  <p>  - Increased the maximum value of the Training Support Grant from &euro;500 per grant to &euro;1,000 to benefit 12,500 jobseekers per annum.</p>  <p>  In delivering on commitments set out in Pathways to Work and the Economic Recovery Plan the Government's ambition is to restore unemployment back to, or below, its pre-pandemic levels of 2019, when the economy was close to full employment.</p></reply>

In addition to Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, carers receive additional support in the form of Free Travel and Household Benefits (for those who live with the person for whom they care) and the annual Carer's Support Grant in respect of each person for whom they care. </p>  <p>  Since 2013, the payment of half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance does not preclude a person from qualifying for Fuel Allowance.  If a person is in receipt of a qualifying non-contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance then they are deemed to have satisfied the means test and Fuel Allowance is payable subject to all remaining criteria being satisfied.  If a person is in receipt of a qualifying contributory social welfare payment and a half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, then the value of the half-rate Carer&rsquo;s Allowance will be assessed in the means test for Fuel Allowance. </p>  <p>  Following the announced &euro;20 increase in allowable means in Budget 2022, a fuel applicant and members of his/her household may have a combined assessable income of up to &euro;120 a week above the appropriate rate of State Pension Contributory and qualify for a payment.  The &euro;120 a week means limit is significantly higher that the weekly fuel allowance rate of &euro;33. </p>  <p>  Any decision to award fuel allowance to all persons in receipt of half-rate Carer's Allowance and another Social Welfare payment would change the nature of the scheme, would have cost implications, and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.   </p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating and travel costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Investment under the NDP will consist of three pillars : Modernisation, New Capacity and First 5 Initiatives. This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during the lifetime of the NDP as follows:</p><p>(1) Modernisation: Much of the existing early learning and childcare infrastructure that was previously delivered by large scale capital programmes is now in need of upgrading and modernisation in order to be fully compliant with new regulations and more recent guidelines, as well as to maximise energy efficiency. This investment will prioritise follow-up funding for buildings that were funded through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP), with funding also available for previously non-funded infrastructure.</p><p>(2) New Capacity: Ireland is approaching the limits of capacity, with shortfalls for early learning and childcare places already evident in some areas and for some cohorts. The rates of participation in early learning and childcare are also lower than European averages. As investment in subsidisation grows in the coming years as committed to in First 5 and the Programme for Government, demand from parents will also increase.</p><p>In the coming years, NDP capital funding allocated to early learning and childcare will be used to increase the stock of early learning and childcare infrastructure, in order to address capacity challenges including the undersupply for certain types of provision and in specific areas of the country.</p><p>(3) First 5 Initiatives: First 5 (Government Strategy for babies, young children and their families 2019 -2028) was launched in 2018 and was re-committed to in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future. First 5 envisages a range of innovative initiatives for the early learning and childcare sector, including piloting Family and Early Childhood Centres and piloting outdoor early learning and childcare provision, piloting meal provision. Each of these initiatives have capital requirements.</p><p>As outlined in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, access to affordable early learning and childcare is inherently linked to creating an equitable society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. Early learning and childcare provision is therefore considered under the National Development Plan, along with housing, schools and health facilities as an integral part of national infrastructure. </p><p>Further information on the Department&rsquo;s NDP allocation and the application process will be communicated to the sector in the near future. The Department advises the service to contact their local CCCs, who will provide information on future capital supports when it becomes available.  </p></reply>

Earlier this year, Minister Rabbitte announced an intention to develop an Autism Innovation Strategy with the aim of launching it in 2022. In Budget 2022, Minister Rabbitte and I secured &euro;100,000 for the design and implementation of the Autism Innovation Strategy, and for awareness raising around it.</p>  <p>  A Strategy Development Group to develop the Autism Innovation Strategy will be established, which Minister Rabbitte has indicated that she will chair. In line with our commitments under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, it is critical that the strategy be informed by the lived experiences of people with autism, their families and their representatives.</p>  <p>  Ireland has two national policy frameworks that address and respond to issues that affect all persons with disabilities, including those with autism. These strategies are the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), the Steering Group of which is chaired by Minister Rabbitte, and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for Persons with Disabilities (CES), which is independently chaired by Fergus Finlay. These strategies guide policy and action across Government in respect of addressing and breaking down the barriers faced by persons with disabilities, including those with autism.</p></reply>

It is incorrect to state that &quot;it is the hope of this Government to give every asylum seeker in this country a home of their own after 6 months of being in direct provision&quot;.</p><p>As outlined in <i>A White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service</i>, applicants for international protection will be provided with suitable State-owned accommodation situated within local communities across the country following an initial period of four months in a Reception and Integration Centre.</p><p>Once the applicant receives a decision on their application, they will then move on from this community accommodation. Those who receive International Protection status will be entitled to live and work on the same basis as all other Irish residents, and it is hoped that the new system will result in a much greater degree of independence for those who do gain status here.</p><p>In response to the Deputy's question to &quot;confirm where these houses are going to come from when we have such a housing crisis in this country&quot;, I hope the Deputy will find the following information helpful:</p><p>In order to provide the new accommodation, the White Paper proposes a multi-strand approach to housing applicants.</p><p>- Accommodation Provided by Approved Housing Bodies or other Not-for-Profit Housing Bodies</p><p>- Urban Renewal Schemes</p><p>- Hosting in the Community, including Rent a Room schemes</p><p>- Private Tenancies</p><p>My Department will be assisted in the sourcing and delivering of this accommodation by the Housing Agency, which has unique knowledge and understanding of housing in Ireland and works with a range of stakeholders involved in the sector across the country.  The new model will provide more accommodation capacity into Ireland's overall housing stock through its new build and urban renewal options.</p><p>By pursuing a multi-strand approach with the support of the Housing Agency, I am confident that we will be able to meet the objectives laid out in the White Paper, which will put family life, autonomy and privacy at the core of the new international protection system.</p></reply>

This is a precautionary measure to mitigate against the risk of COVID, and any new variants, entering the National Reception Centre in Balseskin and the wider IPAS accommodation network. In agreement with the HSE and Public Health authorities at the beginning of October, the length of quarantine required for new arrivals to be cleared for transfer to Balseskin has been reduced from 14 days to 5 days, subject to two negative PCR tests on Days 1 and 5 respectively.  </p><p>Due to capacity issues arising from higher than predicted numbers of new arrivals some residents may still experience delays in their transfer to Balseskin but IPAS officials assure me they are actively working through these issues with the various stakeholders involved.</p><p>The services provided by IPAS are, of course, demand-led and, as demand is currently running higher than predicted, these arrangements are being kept under daily review by my officials to ensure that there is sufficient accommodation to house new arrivals in the State seeking international protection. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the mandatory hotel quarantine that was previously in operation for visitors from designated countries required them to pre-book their quarantine accommodation before their arrival in the state. In contrast to this, IPAS is dealing with, on an around-the-clock basis, the referred and unannounced arrivals of new applicants by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the International Protection Office (IPO), Garda Stations or any other ports of entry. The family composition can range from a single person to a large extended family whose arrival at any time of day or night can often pose a challenge for IPAS and the other support bodies. </p><p>Nevertheless, all accommodation requests are dealt with in a timely manner and IPAS make sure that every new applicant is accommodated within an hour of their arrival in a safe environment without any delay.</p></reply>

All applications are assessed with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme.  </p><p>The Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional (JST) payment is administered by the Department of Social Protection. I understand that this payment is a special arrangement under the Jobseekers Allowance scheme that aims to support lone parents into the workforce where the youngest child is aged between 7 and 13 years inclusive. </p><p>Recipients of Jobseeker's Transitional payment (JST) may pursue a course of education and receive JST, and if eligible, a student maintenance grant. Alternatively, they may apply for Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) Instead of JST should this be more financially beneficial. (The person in receipt of JST makes the choice as to whether to apply for BTEA or SUSI grant assistance (in addition to retaining JST), depending on which payment is more favourable).</p><p>In general terms, there is nothing preventing a lone parent who is in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance Transition payment from applying to SUSI for grant assistance under the Student Grant Scheme.</p><p>Jobseeker's Allowance Transition (where paid to the applicant) is treated as an income disregard for the purposes of the Student Grant Scheme, i.e. it is not included in the calculation of reckonable income for the student grant means test. Furthermore, the Jobseekers Allowance Transition payment is an eligible payment for the special rate of maintenance grant. </p><p>Students in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) are not eligible for maintenance support under the Student Grant Scheme, as this would result in a duplication of income support payments. On this basis, there are no plans to amend the current arrangements. However, students in receipt of BTEA may be considered for SUSI fee supports up to a maximum of &euro;6,270 under the Student Grant Scheme.</p><p>SUSI does not hold data on the age of children linked to the Jobseekers Transition payment. Also, I understand that persons in receipt of this payment may subsequently move onto other eligible long-term payments for the special rate of maintenance grant. These payments may not necessarily identify the individual as being a lone parent. </p><p>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI.</p><p>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe. </p><p>Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.  </p></reply>

The Safe Return Plan can be accessed at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/bcd91-a-safe-return-to-on-site-further-and-higher-education-and-research/</p>  <p>  The plan, which is predicated on the sector&rsquo;s full commitment to a significant increase in on-site teaching and learning activities and research, was developed following extensive discussions between sectoral representatives, public health and other relevant stakeholders, and provides a framework for higher education institutions to enable a return to on-site campus learning that that is in line with public health guidance. In that context, the sector has now arrived at a position where the return to on-site is well underway with approximately 400,000 learners having returned to on-site activity across all our further and higher education institutions. </p>  <p>  At a minimum, on-site activity includes laboratory teaching and learning, classroom based teaching and learning, tutorials, workshops, smaller lectures, research, return to work-spaces and access to libraries with appropriate protective measures in place. Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies, and the way in which the Plan is implemented varies from institution to institution, recognising their own local context and physical infrastructure. As I understand it, Trinity College has resumed face to face learning across its campus since last month and I am concerned to read of the Deputy's constituent's experience and will seek further clarity on this matter.  </p></reply>

It is in this context that the sector continues to operate in accordance with the provisions of the Safe Return Plan, which has facilitated the return of over 400,000 learners since September, and which has been supplemented by recent guidance in relation to the sectoral approach for this current phase of the response.</p><p>For activities that are context dependent, in such a way that a one size fits all approach will not work across the sector, institutions have discretion to adopt public health measures appropriate to their own context, actively using significant precautionary measures to mitigate risk based on risk assessment and management systems, engagement with their stakeholders and building on the practices that were accrued through onsite provision in the more restrictive context of 2020/21. This encompasses ongoing monitoring and reviewing of plans, practices and measures including the approaches that institutions will take to terminal examinations.</p><p>Last week, I met with management, staff and student representatives and the issue of examinations was discussed.

This was established to meet an identified need for applicants who choose to engage the assistance of their public representatives in making enquiries about their grant applications. This service compliments the established channels provided by SUSI which include online application tracking, a dedicated website, a telephone helpdesk, email and social media, including Facebook and Twitter. Enquiries may be emailed direct to SUSI at oireachtas@susi.ie. Staff in SUSI are responding to email queries within a matter of days. With regard to the specific application, I have been advised by my officials that the student outlined by the Deputy applied to SUSI as an independent mature student. According to SUSI, evidence of independent residency could not be established. The student exhausted the SUSI appeals process and on the 16th November 2021 the applicant contacted Support Desk to cancel her application. The application was cancelled and a letter confirming same was sent. The issue of independent applicants is an issue consistently raised with me and I intend to engage with my officials on this matter.</p></reply>

The Prison Service Covid-19 response aims to prevent the spread of infection into a prison; detect early any possible infection in a prisoner or staff member; and prevent the spread of infection within a prison should there be a confirmed case.</p><p>The measures which have been introduced to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in prisons are updated on a regular basis, are guided by the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team and are consistent with the prison specific guidance for the management of Covid-19 issued by the World Health Organisation and the guidance of the Council of Europe.</p><p>On 9 June 2021 a bespoke prison vaccination programme commenced on a phased prison-by-prison basis. Vaccinations were administered by National Ambulance Service and Irish Prison Service healthcare teams to all prisoners who wished to receive one.  The roll out of a Covid-19 mass vaccination programme has seen in excess of 85% of the prison population vaccinated.  </p><p>The first positive prisoner case of Covid-19 was confirmed in an Irish prison in August 2020. As such, there were no confirmed cases of Covid-19 in our prisons in 2019. </p><p>There were 23 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in 2020 and 254 confirmed cases in 2021 (figures are correct up to 20 November, 2021). </p><p>I can advise the Deputy that there were no prisoner hospitalisations due to Covid-19 until earlier this month (November 2021) when two prisoners were hospitalised following an outbreak of Covid-19 in the Midlands Prison. I regret  to inform the Deputy that one of the prisoners who was hospitalised sadly passed away. His cause of death will be determined by a Coroner's Inquest and I would like to extend my sympathies to his family and friends on their loss. </p><p>Detailed information on the number of confirmed cases in prisons in 2020 and 2021 is set out in Tables 1 and 2 below. </p><p><b>Table 1 Confirmed Prison Covid-19 cases, Covid-19 Hospitalisation and Covid-19 related deaths in 2020 by prison</b>;  <table>    <tr>       <th>Prison</th>       <th>Total Number of Covid-19 Cases</th>       <th>Covid-19 Related   Hospitalisation</th>       <th>Covid-19 Related Deaths</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dochas</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cloverhill</td>       <td>9</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mountjoy</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Midlands</td>       <td>7</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>4</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Castlerea</td>       <td>1</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Loughan</td>       <td>0</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wheatfield</td>       <td>0</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shelton Abbey</td>       <td>0</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Portlaoise</td>       <td>0</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>0</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Arbour Hill</td>       <td>0</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>23</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>0</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2 provides the number of prisoner confirmed Covid-19 cases including hospitalisation and related deaths in 2021 by prison;</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Prison</th>       <th>Total Number of Covid-19 Cases</th>       <th>Covid-19 Related   Hospitalisation</th>       <th>Covid-19 Related Deaths</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dochas</td>       <td>6</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cloverhill</td>       <td>49</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mountjoy</td>       <td>53</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Midlands</td>       <td>66</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>*1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>16</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Castlerea</td>       <td>7</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Loughan</td>       <td>12</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wheatfield</td>       <td>13</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Shelton Abbey</td>       <td>3</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Portlaoise</td>       <td>3</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>12</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Arbour Hill</td>       <td>14</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>254</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1*</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*The cause of death is a matter for the Coroner's Office.</p></reply>

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has provided me with the following update on Roscommon Town Courthouse.</p><p>The Government's revised National Development Plan 2021 -2030 includes a number of Courts Service capital building projects to be completed during the period of the plan, including the Hammond Lane Family Law Complex and the provision of further new or refurbished courthouses in cities and county towns, including in Roscommon.  </p><p>The Courts Service informs me that it has commenced the process of identifying/acquiring suitable sites for those projects to be completed over the period of the Plan. Additional space on the historic Roscommon Courthouse site has already been acquired from the Local Authority to facilitate the future expansion/refurbishment of the courthouse. </p><p>Due to the poor condition of the historic courthouse in Roscommon, I am informed that the Courts Service has had no option but to source alternative accommodation until such time as the refurbishment project is completed.  The Courts Service recognises the local importance of having court sittings in the town. With this in mind, a temporary premises has been sourced at Racecourse Road and I am informed that the fit out will commence shortly dependent on the successful conclusion of lease arrangements. The temporary premises will be capable of hosting multiple defendant jury trials - which currently cannot be accommodated in the historic courthouse. I understand that the temporary premises is expected to be operational towards the end of Q2 2022, Covid-19 restrictions permitting.</p></reply>

I thank both the Inspector of Mental Health Services and the Inspector of Prisons for their work on this important issue and I believe the publication of this report is very timely. </p><p>We know that the healthcare needs of vulnerable, sometimes seriously ill, people who interact with the criminal justice system are complex and require whole of systems consideration and priority action. It is widely acknowledged that these people are too ill to be in prison as they require urgent medication and treatment and that there is a vital need to put in place properly resourced, appropriately located systems of care for these most vulnerable people in society.  </p><p>The Council of Europe Committee on the Prevention of Torture report last year reinforced the need for us to work together to provide appropriate care for those that have specific mental health needs when they come into contact with our criminal justice system.  </p><p>This is also acknowledged in the Programme for Government commitment to the establishment of a high-level cross-departmental/cross-agency taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of those imprisoned, and primary care support on release.  </p><p>I am pleased to say that considerable progress has been made on meeting this commitment. Last April, the Minister for Health and I established the High Level Taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of persons interacting with the criminal justice system.  The Taskforce has already met on five occasions and has established three expert subgroups on diversion, prison and central mental hospital capacity and community throughcare. The Taskforce is aiming to provide a high level implementation plan for its recommendations by early 2022. </p><p>I am advised that the Mental Health Commission has now written to the chair of the Taskforce, providing her with a copy of the report and expressing their openness to presenting the report to the group. I understand that the chair has welcomed the offer to meet as it is very timely in terms of the Taskforce&rsquo;s desire to consult with the Commission. Arrangements in that regard are currently being finalised. </p><p>The Commission report also references Crisis Intervention Teams. Following on from the recommendation of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland,<i></i>the Limerick Division are leading out on the design and implementation of a Crisis Intervention Team pilot project.</p><p>I am advised that this is currently at consultation phase and that liaison is on-going through a dedicated Steering Committee with local HSE representatives. It is envisaged that it will involve a co-located response unit comprising of a Community Psychiatric Nurse working alongside frontline members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond to calls from anyone in crisis. </p></reply>

This application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  This year, we are on track to deliver approximately 11,000 decisions, significantly exceeding the levels achieved in the last two years. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

It is not open to me as Minister to comment on any aspect of the Judge's work or the process of compiling the final report.

I understand that Judge Haughton has been in contact with the O&rsquo;Farrell family throughout his scoping exercise.</p>  <p>  I am informed the process is now at the stage of seeking comments on various sections of the report from the parties named in it. Judge Haughton wrote to my Department seeking comments on a number of sections of his draft report and the Department has responded to this request.

This includes the enforcement of all applicable legislation and the management of the Fixed Charge Notice system.</p><p>The enforcement of public health legislation by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner and the issuance of any individual Fixed Charge Penalty Notice (FCPN) is not within my remit as Minister, nor is any operational policing decision related to the enforcement of any applicable legislation.</p><p>I am informed that an initial period of 28 days from the date of the Fixed Charge Notice allows for payment at the fixed charge amount. A further period of 28 days is permitted to accept payment at the fixed charge amount plus 50%.</p><p>A third payment option was introduced on 1 June 2017, with the commencement of Section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, as amended, by the Department of Transport. Section 44 provides that a person who is served with a summons in respect of a fixed charge offence may pay a fixed charge of an amount 100% greater than the original fixed charge, not later than 7 days before the date of the court on which the charge is to be heard, and a second Fixed Charge Notice is issued to this effect.

The application should be made not less than 60 days before the first day on which it is intended to promote the lottery. This period was intended to ensure that the court is provided with sufficient notice and full details of the proposed lottery activity so as to determine the application. Revised conditions for the promotion of lotteries are now contained in Section 28 of the 2019 Act. </p></reply>

Currently, due to public health restrictions, for the safety of all our customers and staff, the office can only operate at 50% of our normal capacity. This means that we can register a maximum of 200 customers per day. My Department is currently examining plans to operate the Registration Office seven days a week to meet demand.</p>  <p>  My Department is also aware that there have been issues in the past around the securing of registration appointments and has continually introduced software fixes designed to improve the system. These new measures have been partly successful in preventing the block booking of appointments by third party agents. </p>  <p>  However, some third party agents continue to provide appointment booking services in return for payment on the basis that the person provides them with their personal details in advance. My Department strongly advises against this practice of providing sensitive and personal data to unregulated and unknown third parties.</p>  <p>  Customers should continue to apply directly for appointments as they become available without charge, through the online appointments system: burghquayregistrationoffice.inis.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  A new Immigration Service appointment and scheduling system, which will streamline and further improve the registration process, is currently being developed and is expected to be available to customers by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Last week, I announced a number of immigration changes to simplify and streamline the processing of citizenship applications and to facilitate immigration requirements for our customers over the Christmas period.  </p>  <p>  This has ensured that over the Christmas period, customers with expired Irish Residence Permit (IRP) cards may continue to use these cards to enable them to depart and return to the State in confidence until 15 January 2022.</p>  <p>  I also suspended the re-entry visa requirement for minors aged 16 years and under from 12 November 2021 to 15 January 2022. This will help families intending to travel together during the Christmas period, without the requirement to apply for re-entry visas. </p>  <p>  When travelling, customers should print the Travel Confirmation Notice on my Department's Irish Immigration website at: www.irishimmigration.ie/new-immigration-changes-announced/, and present it, along with their expired IRP card, to immigration authorities and airline carriers, as requested. </p></reply>

This application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  This year, we are on track to deliver approximately 11,000 decisions, significantly exceeding the levels achieved in the last two years.

It will then be sent to the President.  Subject to the President&rsquo;s signature, section 7 of the Bill provides for it to come into operation on 30 November. </p>  <p>  The effect of the Bill will be that:</p>  <p>  - Firstly, the law applicable to prescriptive profits &agrave; prendre will largely be reverted to the judge-made law that applied before the 2009 Act (the &lsquo;doctrine of lost modern grant&rsquo;), which is considered as the most satisfactory and familiar set of pre-2009 rules, in the interests of clarity and certainty.</p>  <p>  - Secondly, it will still be possible to validate and register a prescriptive right after 30 November 2021: either by applying to court, or by registering it directly with the Property Registration Authority. But this will be optional, as it was before the 2009 Act, rather than a mandatory requirement to avoid losing any rights acquired through long use.</p>  <p>  - Thirdly, the Bill does not &lsquo;reset the clock&rsquo;. User periods dating before 1 December 2021 can still be counted, in a claim first made after 30 November 2021.</p>  <p>  One point that is relevant to seaweed profits &agrave; prendre is that the user period required to establish a prescriptive right against State owned foreshore is the same under the Bill as under the 2009 Act &ndash; 60 years, compared to 20 years against privately owned land. (This reflects recommendations made in 2002 by the Law Reform Commission.)</p>  <p>  However, under the Bill:</p>  <p>  - any user who had already completed 20 years&rsquo; use as of right over the foreshore before 1 December 2009 will be entitled to have their claim decided under the pre-2009 Act rules, where 20 years&rsquo; use as of right is sufficient;</p>  <p>  - any user whose court proceedings, or application to the Property Registration Authority, to register a claim over the foreshore is still pending on 30 November 2021, will be entitled to have it decided under the pre-2009 Act rules, where 20 years&rsquo; use as of right is sufficient;</p>  <p>  - a user who first makes a claim against the foreshore after 30 November 2021 will need to show 60 years&rsquo; use as of right (as would have been the case under the 2009 Act), but in contrast to the 2009 Act, they can rely on periods of use before, as well as after, 30 November 2021 and the clock is not re-set.  </p>  <p>  Effectively, therefore, seaweed harvesters with established rights or established periods of use before 30 November 2021 are better protected under the Bill than they would have been under the 2009 Act, and will not lose their rights or their established user periods.</p>  <p>  I have also secured Government agreement to establish a time-limited review to examine the overall law relating to prescriptive easements and profits &agrave; prendre, after the Bill comes into operation, and determine whether any further changes are desirable to ensure that the law in this area is placed on a sustainable long-term footing.

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p><p>The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE has advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which include a 14 day period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work in particular in Model 4 hospitals. The situation is to be reviewed after that period.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.</p><p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p><p>For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.</p><p>In relation to the issues raised by the Deputy, the attached waiting list reports, published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund on their website show the breakdown by time-band of children on Acute Hospital waiting lists for Outpatient and Inpatient/Day case appointments at the end of October 2021.</p><p>&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;IPDC Active&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;</p><p>&amp;lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&amp;gt;OPD&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;</p></reply>

The HSE has advised that 42 of these beds are now open, bringing baseline capacity to 297 although the number of beds open on any given day fluctuates as a result of a variety of factors. The funding provided in 2021 includes 5 beds at St. James's Hospital. 4 of these beds are now open, with recruitment underway to open the remaining bed as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  Budget 2022 is providing &euro;10.45m to complete Phase 1 of the Strategic Plan, allowing for recruitment of the necessary staff to allow for the opening of 19 further permanent critical care beds, fund the upgrade of a number of beds from high dependency (Level 2) to ICU (Level 3), and implementation of an ICU Clinical Information System to support our critical care staff in managing their patients more effectively, improving patient outcomes and shortening length of stay in ICU.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the Strategic Plan will see further beds added through the development of new build capacity at a number of sites, including further beds at St James's Hospital. </p></reply>

Currently in Ireland the DAFNE programme is the only programme that meets the required accreditation criteria for this guideline.</p>  <p>  For a hospital diabetes centre to become a DAFNE centre, a team comprising a doctor, nurse and dietitian with expertise in the management of diabetes from that centre is required to complete the DAFNE training, enter into a licence agreement with DAFNE and continue to meet the accreditation standards aligned.

Support has been provided to the diabetes team in Limerick University Hospital in this respect. UHL will be further enabled by the additional staffing allocation supported by the Enhanced Community Care funding, whose role includes the delivery of Type 1 diabetes Self-Management education, e.g., DAFNE.</p></reply>

It was intended that the registry would be in place by 2021. However, the project was paused as it was dependent on the input and expertise of key HSE staff who were redeployed onto urgent on-going COVID-19 work.</p>  <p>  The development of a National Diabetes Registry remains a priority, and following substantial increases in investment in eHealth, is now being considered as part of a wider review of Ireland&rsquo;s health information strategy. The diabetes registry, along with other disease-specific registries, will operate as &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; registries and will use existing health and social care records to enable the monitoring of the incidence and prevalence of disease in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I acknowledge that Diabetes is a significant issue and driver of health expenditure. In this regard, the 2019 GP Agreement introduced the chronic disease management programme for adult GMS patients who have one or more specific chronic diseases, of which Type 2 Diabetes is one.</p>  <p>  For the first time we are seeing the delivery of structured care on a large scale for patients with chronic conditions in a primary care setting.  Patients with an existing diagnosis of one of the specified chronic conditions, and those who are assessed by their GP on an opportunistic case finding basis, as well as those identified as high risk, will benefit under the programme. It is estimated that over 430,000 medical card and GP visit card patients will benefit from the programme when it is fully implemented.</p>  <p>  The programme focuses on prevention, patient empowerment, early diagnosis and intervention, multi-morbidity and the provision of care as close to home as possible. The aim of the programme is to reduce morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases.</p></reply>

Public health advice remains that those who are not fully vaccinated should avoid congregated indoor settings for their own and others safety.</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team gave some consideration to the issues arising for those people that can&rsquo;t receive a COVID-19 vaccine for medical reasons as part of its discussions on the 18th October 2021 on the continuing response to COVID-19 and the extension of Covid Pass arrangements. The matter is being given further consideration.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to be aware that on 15 July, NIAC made a recommendation, which was endorsed by the Chief Medical Officer and accepted by the Minister for Health that while the preference was for homologous vaccination regimens (using the same vaccine as part of a two dose regime) that selective use of heterologous vaccination schedules (two different vaccines used as part of two dose regime) should be permitted where a second vaccine dose of a homologous regimen is contraindicated, irrespective of whether the first dose was an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine. NIAC in conjunction with the RCPI and the Irish Association of Allergy and Immunology have prepared a guide to aid vaccinators and other healthcare workers on how to advise allergic individuals in respect of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, this guide is available here:<i>rcpi-live-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FAQs-about-COVID19-Vaccines-and-Allergies_12August2021.pdf </i></p></reply>

The year-on-year increases to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) since Budget 2017 reflect this priority and Budget 2021 saw the funding of the NTPF increase by &euro;25million to &euro;130million. There was further increase announced in Budget 2022 and the total allocation for 2022 is &euro;150 million </p><p>The NTPF procures capacity for high-volume procedures in order to positively impact waiting time for patients. Such procedures may be procured in both private hospitals (outsourcing), or public hospitals (insourcing). In order to ensure competitive pricing as part of their outsourcing programme, the NTPF works with private hospitals from a panel agreement and engages in procurement processes through e-tender. In relation to insourcing, a public hospital may have some spare capacity but require further funding in order to utilise it. Such public hospitals may make a proposal to the NTPF, whereby the NTPF pay a fixed price per procedure performed.

The role of the group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and examine workforce challenges in home support and nursing homes. Potential areas to be considered include recruitment, retention, training, career development, and the sustainable employment of home support workers into the future.</p>  <p>  Recruitment of the 130 posts funded for the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care needs is scheduled to commence in this quarter. A National Home Support Office is in the process of being established. The testing of the reformed model of service delivery for home support commenced this month in one pilot site, with other pilot sites to be fully operational by January 2022. Last year we secured additional funding of &euro;150 million for home support and the HSE National Service Plan sets a target to provide 24 million hours of home support. This allocation of home support has been maintained for 2022. It is estimated that at the end of September some 15 million hours had been provided to over 53,000 people. This is about 2.2 million more hours compared to the same period last year.</p>  <p>  The employment permits system operated by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and or labour shortages. The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market. </p>  <p>  The Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists are subject to twice-yearly review which is predicated on a formalised and evidence-based process which involves consideration of the research undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (Solas), the Expert Group of Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the National Skills Council, and input by relevant Government Departments in addition to the public consultation phase.  </p>  <p>  As part of the most recent review of the occupations lists, officials from my Department engaged in discussions with officials from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment in respect of submissions received relating to the health sector. The submissions received from the home care sector were considered by the Department of Health, Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and the Interdepartmental Group for Economic Migration Policy.</p>  <p>  The review did not recommend removal of the occupation of care worker/home carers from the Ineligible Occupations List as the evidence suggested that contracts of employment and terms and conditions being offered are significant factors in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector, rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage. To have an occupation removed from the ineligible list, there needs to be a clear demonstration that recruitment difficulties are solely due to skills and labour shortages in Ireland and the EEA and not to other factors such as salary and or employment conditions. </p>  <p>  It was not considered appropriate to make any changes to the eligibility for employment permits for home carers on this occasion as there was insufficient evidence that the issue is not one of terms and conditions. A longer-term approach is required to address these challenges and the Department of Health is committed to working with relevant stakeholders to seek to address these issues.</p></reply>

This includes reviewing the role, availability and usage of antigen testing on an ongoing basis.   The HSE already has information relating to antigen testing published on its website and a central system for recording of results from antigen testing as part of the programmes already underway.  </p>  <p>  Antigen testing is already being used widely across the State, supported by the health service, including for testing of asymptomatic, vaccinated close contacts of a confirmed case, and in pilot programmes involving staff in early childcare facilities, staff and students in further and higher education, staff in food production facilities and in residential Care Facilities (RCFs) for Older Persons. In addition, the HSE is in the process of rolling out a programme to provide antigen tests to parents of children in a pod in primary school where another child in the pod has had a positive PCR test. Antigen tests will be offered to a full class when two or more confirmed cases arise outside of a single pod in a class within a seven-day period.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that it is important that anyone who has any respiratory symptoms should self-isolate at home and get a Covid-19 PCR test when indicated.</p></reply>

The agreement runs to the end of January 2022. The arrangement allows the HSE to invoke the agreement to access guaranteed levels of between 15% and 30% of the private hospitals' capacity, depending on the metrics, to treat those in need of time dependent urgent care. </p>  <p>  An arrangement along similar lines was put in place in response to the ransomware cyber-attack.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that the 18 private hospitals have an overall capacity of 2,146 beds. The volume available to the public sector with access to 15% of private hospital capacity would therefore be 322 beds and 644 beds at 30%.</p>  <p>  The additional capacity provided by the private hospitals is critical to enabling the public health system cope with large scale surges in the incidences of the disease. It is intended to use the capacity of the private hospitals for urgent, time-dependant and complex care.</p>  <p>  The HSE also has a separate procurement arrangement with private hospitals to provide acute services and diagnostics. This is required to address some of the anticipated shortfalls in capacity arising from Covid-19 measures over the next couple of years.</p>  <p>  Private hospital facilities are regularly used by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to provide extra capacity for public patients for elective care.</p></reply>

That Policy set out the roadmap for the future provision of oral healthcare to the eligible population. It has two key goals; first, to provide the supports to enable every individual to achieve their best oral health, and second, to reduce oral health inequalities across the population, by enabling vulnerable groups to access oral healthcare and improve their oral health.</p>  <p>  The Dental Treatment Services Scheme, which dates from the 1990s is available to medical card holders aged 16 and over. The dental care is provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. Patients may choose to have their treatment undertaken by any dentist who participates in the scheme. The Scheme covers a dental examination, two fillings in each calendar year, prescriptions, denture repairs and extractions as necessary. Other more complex treatments such as the provision of dentures require the approval of the HSE before the dentist can proceed and in this case the dentist applies directly to the HSE.</p>  <p>  There is a need to align the DTSS with best international evidence and practice, and legislation, as outlined in Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy. Regretfully, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the roll-out of the Policy to be delayed and the proposed review of the DTSS contract to be deferred.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, there has been continued engagement between my officials, the HSE and the dental community throughout the pandemic on infection control measures, guidelines for safe dental practice, and ensuring that dental professionals were included in the high-risk group for early vaccination. This sustained engagement was with a view to ensuring that a safe satisfactory service could be continued for the eligible population.</p>  <p>  It is regrettable that a significant number of dentists chose to leave the Scheme that provides care for medical card patients during the pandemic, which  has led to difficulties for medical card patients in accessing dental care in some parts of the country . In such circumstances, I have been assured that the HSE Public Dental Service is seeking to provide emergency cover for any medical card patients who are experiencing such problems.</p>  <p>  I have given a commitment to a substantive review of the DTSS, which will include fees paid to dentists. I have also acknowledged the immediate issues of concern with current arrangements under the Scheme.</p>  <p>  I instructed my officials to hold talks with the Irish Dental Association to address both of these issues. I am aware that preliminary talks were held in June this year and that it is proposed to hold further talks in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I would also wish to point out that I secured additional funding of &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 to address immediate issues with the DTSS, which is on top of the annual allocation of &euro;56 million for 2022.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the Strategic Plan for Critical Care, which was noted by Government in December 2020, aims to increase capacity from the 2020 baseline of 255 critical care beds, to 446 over time, to fully address, and in fact surpass, the Capacity Review&rsquo;s recommendations in regard to critical care.</p>  <p>  Funding to increase critical care capacity is provided through the annual Estimates and service planning process, and in line with the Strategic Plan for Critical Care. </p>  <p>  Very significant funding of &euro;52m was provided by Government in Budget 2021 to commence implementation of Phase 1 of the Plan. This provides for the permanent retention of 40 additional critical care beds which were funded temporarily in 2020 as part of the Covid response, and for the opening of a further 26 beds in new build capacity. The HSE has advised that 42 of these beds are now open, bringing baseline capacity to 297 although the number of beds open on any given day fluctuates as a result of a variety of factors.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;10.5m is being provided in 2022. This will bring the number of permanent critical care beds from 255 in 2020 to 340 by the end of 2022/early 2023.  This represents a 33% increase, or an additional 85 beds funded since 2020. Phase Two of the Plan will see further beds added through the development of new build capacity at five prioritised sites, subject to necessary approval processes.</p>  <p>  Minister Donnelly published the HSE Winter Preparedness Plan for Winter 21/22 on the 15th November. The Plan centres on three core objectives: ED avoidance, patient flow and hospital egress to mitigate the expected challenges in providing emergency care this winter while also continuing to respond to Covid 19. The Winter Plan contains a number of initiatives to deliver its core objectives of ED avoidance by treating people at home or in the community and by allowing them to return home following hospitalisation quickly, such GP Liaison nurses, various community teams, the expansions of the NAS PathFinder programme and additional home support hours. This year&rsquo;s Winter Plan recognises that a whole system response is required and outlines how the HSE proposes to manage these challenges across primary, community and acute care including measures to allow the public system to access private healthcare capacity.</p></reply>

This was conducted by Professor Tom Collins at the end of 2020. This review was conducted to examine any additional challenges that the Pandemic may have created for student nurses and midwives on supernumerary clinical placement and final-year internship placement. I accepted all of the recommendations that Professor Collins made. This included the payment of a Pandemic Placement Grant (PPG) of &euro;100 per week for each week of supernumerary clinical placement from January 2021. However, I called for the PPG to be backdated to the start of the 2020/2021 academic year.</p>  <p>  I also directed that a second longer-term independent review of student nurse and midwife clinical placement allowances take place. This review was conducted by Mr Sean McHugh and included an examination of the existing clinical placement allowances payable to student nurses and midwives on placement. </p>  <p>  Following this review, on 04 November 2021, I announced that the Government approved my proposal to provide significant additional supports, worth &euro;12m for student nurses and midwives while attending their clinical placements. These temporary measures will assist student nurses and midwives while work is ongoing at my Department to progress the recommendations arising from the longer-term review.</p>  <p>  Among these temporary measures, I extended the Pandemic Placement Grant of &euro;100 per week to all eligible nursing and midwifery students on placement, backdating it to September 2021. This funding will support students attending their clinical placements. Furthermore, while my Department is developing detailed proposals to give effect to the recommendation relating to intern pay, the PPG shall now be extended to 4th year nursing and midwifery internship students at the rate of 50%, commencing January 2022. This will have the effect of increasing supports by &euro;1,800 for this cohort.</p>  <p>  The Government is also providing additional support to supernumerary students needing overnight accommodation away from their normal place of residence in order to attend some of their clinical placements. This includes increasing the cap on the vouched accommodation allowance, as outlined in Department of Health Circular 09/2004, from &euro;50.79 per week to &euro;100 per week of placement, which is to be backdated to September 2021. </p>  <p>  It is important that we support our student nurses and midwives to undertake their clinical placements. I am grateful to Professor Tom Collins and Mr. McHugh for undertaking the important pieces of work as it has helped my consideration of how to best support our student nurses and midwives as they continue their undergraduate education.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the Strategic Plan for Critical Care, which was noted by Government in December 2020, aims to increase capacity from the 2020 baseline of 255 critical care beds, to 446 over time, to fully address the Capacity Review&rsquo;s recommendations in regard to critical care.</p><p>Very significant funding of &euro;52m was provided by Government in Budget 2021 to commence implementation of Phase 1 of the Plan. This provides for the permanent retention of 40 additional critical care beds which were funded temporarily in 2020 as part of the Covid response, and for the opening of a further 26 beds in new build capacity. The HSE has advised that 42 of these beds are now open, bringing baseline capacity to 297 although the number of beds open on any given day fluctuates as a result of a variety of factors.</p><p>An additional &euro;10.5m is being provided in 2022. This will bring the number of permanent critical care beds from 255 in 2020 to 340 by the end of 2022/early 2023.  This represents a 33% increase, or an additional 85 beds funded since 2020.</p><p>Phase Two of the Plan will see further beds added through the development of new build capacity at five prioritised sites, subject to necessary approval processes.</p></reply>

We are working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  GPs are self-employed practitioners and therefore may establish practices at a place of their own choosing. There is no prescribed ratio of GPs to patients and the State does not regulate the number of GPs that can set up in a town or community. Under the GMS scheme, the HSE contracts GPs to provide medical services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders. Where a vacancy arises in a practice with a GMS contract, the HSE becomes actively involved in the selection process to find a replacement GP.</p>  <p>  Several efforts to increase the number of practising GPs have been undertaken in recent years. The number of entrants to GP training has increased from 120 in 2009 to 233 this year, with large increases made in recent years. Further increases are expected as responsibility for training has transferred from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners. Changes have been made to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to facilitate more flexible/shared GMS contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme. An enhanced supports package for rural GP practices was also introduced.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to launch a national recruitment strategy, however recent developments in relation to general practice, in particular the 2019 Agreement on Contractual Reform and Service Development, have helped to re-establish general practice in Ireland as an attractive career choice.  The additional investment, which will amount to &euro;210 million annually once the Agreement is fully implemented, provides for an increase in capitation fees, improved maternity and paternity arrangements as well as enhanced supports for rural practices. In addition, targeted funding of &euro;2 million will also be set aside to provide additional support to practices in deprived urban areas. The wider reforms in the health service will also help to provide an atmosphere in which the practice of medicine in Ireland will remain attractive. The additional investment in general practice provides a sound basis for ensuring that GPs have access to a credible and rewarding career path in Ireland.</p></reply>

The strategy is underpinned by an integrated whole-of-Government approach to resolving the drug problem based on a partnership approach between the statutory, community and voluntary sectors.  </p><p>The recently published mid-term review of the strategy shows significant progress in implementing the action plan for the period 2017 to 2020, with only a small number of the 50 actions outstanding.  Access to and availability of drug services has improved, especially services for women, people who are homeless and those with heroin addiction. There is a new clinical programme for dual diagnosis and the Government is championing an alternative health-led approach for the possession of drugs for personal use.</p><p>The mid-term review also looked at the effectiveness of government expenditure on the national drugs strategy, based on key indicators. It estimates the significant costs for society of drug use for the criminal justice system and the economy.</p><p>Six strategic priorities have been identified for the remaining years of the strategy until 2025. These will strengthen the health-led approach to drug use, as set out in the Programme for Government, and align with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan.The six strategic priorities for 2021-2025 are:</p><p>- strengthen the prevention of drug and alcohol use among children and young people; </p><p>- enhance access and delivery of drug and alcohol services in the community, </p><p>- develop harm reduction responses and integrated care pathways for high-risk drug users, </p><p>- address the social determinants and consequences of drugs use in disadvantaged communities: </p><p>- promote alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug-related offences: and </p><p>- strengthen evidence-informed and outcomes-focused practice, services, policies and strategy implementation.</p><p>New oversight  structures will drive the implementation of the strategic priorities for 2021-2025, strengthen the partnership approach and give a stronger voice to civil society in developing national policy. I am also providing independent leadership to ensure the accountability of all stakeholders and involving service users to provide insights from the lived experience of drug and alcohol addiction.</p><p>To support the implementation of the strategic priorities, I secured additional funding of &euro;6m for new health measures in Budget 2022.  I have released details on these measures in a factsheet, which is available HERE</p></reply>

This has been advised to GPs by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The issue of GPs charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services is complex given the numerous reasons and circumstances under which blood tests are taken. My Department and the HSE discussed this issue previously with the relevant GP representative body.  However, it did not prove possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances. It is intended to raise this issue again at an appropriate time.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in, having commenced last year, will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  The position remains that where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of GMS patients, carry out an investigation into each complaint and will, where appropriate, arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP.</p>  <p>  Consultation fees charged by GPs outside the terms of the GMS contracts are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and their patients. The HSE does not have any role in relation to such fees.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.</p>  <p>  The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE has advised all Hospital Groups to take a series of immediate actions which include a 14 day period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and urgent time sensitive work in particular in Model 4 hospitals. The situation is to be reviewed after that period.</p>  <p>  My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack.</p>  <p>In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.  </p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services. </p>  <p>  The information requested by the Deputy concerning, number of persons currently on waiting lists for appointments at Kerry General Hospital is outlined in the attached document. This information is also available on the NTPF website at: www.ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm</p></reply>

A new GP surgery was set up with a locum GP and full nursing and secretarial staff. </p>  <p>  The combined size of both GMS panels is relatively small and would generally be served by one GP. The HSE previously advertised a single GMS post for both panels on two occasions, however these campaigns were ultimately unsuccessful. As mentioned, the HSE has now re-advertised the post for a third time nationally and in the UK, Australia and Canada.</p>  <p>  Despite the increased demand for GP services associated with this time of year, the HSE has not received any complaints relating to access to the service currently provided. </p></reply>

GPs are performing assessments over the phone to determine if a patient needs to attend the surgery or whether a remote phone consultation is suitable.

However, in recognition of the central role general practice plays in the delivery of healthcare, the HSE provides support to GPs to ensure continuity of service. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, a number of GP support fees, as well as a grant payment for GP out of hour services providers, have been in place since March 2020.</p>  <p>  Building on the experience of the pandemic, additional supports and resources were provided to general practice last winter, taking account of the heightened impact of the pandemic at the time. It is important that some of the most beneficial reforms and learning from the Covid-19 experience are maintained. In this context, it is envisaged that a more targeted approach will be required this year with a particular focus on how the surge in capacity over the winter period will bring pressure on single handed practices which may be impacted by illness or excessive demand. A range of appropriate measures will be required to ensure the continued provision of supports to local GPs services. </p>  <p>  &euro;10m has been provided to implement measures to support general practice in line with the approach outlined above, with the detailed arrangements currently being finalised in consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation on behalf of GPs.</p></reply>

These rules are implemented in Ireland via the National Sheep Identification  System (NSIS).</p>  <p>  All sheep must be identified electronically by nine months of age, or on leaving the holding of their birth, whichever is the earlier date.</p>  <p>  Lambs moving directly to slaughter from their holding of origin while aged under 12 months may be identified with a single electronic tag, inserted in the animal's right ear.</p>  <p>  All other sheep must be identified with a full electronic tag set consisting of an electronic tag in the right ear and a corresponding conventional tag in the left ear. An electronic bolus set comprising an electronic bolus implanted into the stomach of the sheep and a matching conventional tag is also permitted.</p>  <p>  All sheep tags (and boluses) must display an individual animal identification number encompassing the unique sheep designator assigned by the Department to the holding on which an individual sheep is born.  Sheep tags can only be purchased by registered sheep keepers and can only be sourced from tag suppliers approved by the Department. The Department's systems allocate and record the details of all sheep tags (and boluses) ordered.</p>  <p>  As sheep are not identified at birth, the Department does not maintain a central identification register for sheep.</p>  <p>  However, in accordance with EU legislative requirements, all sheep movements are recorded on a batch basis on the Department's central Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) system. All sheep movements must be accompanied by a uniquely numbered dispatch document listing the individual tag numbers of all sheep in the batch.</p>  <p>  Both parties to a movement must retain a copy of the associated dispatch document. In addition, sheep keepers are legislatively required to record the details of all movements into and out of their holding on a flock register. The register must further record the number of sheep notified to my Department in the context of the annual sheep census, the submission of which is also a legal requirement.</p>  <p>  Flock registers must be kept up-to-date at all times and  must be immediately presented to an authorised officer when requested for inspection purposes.</p>  <p>Sheep slaughter plants which are approved by my Department, together with a significant number of marts, have also been authorised by my Department to operate as Central Points of Recording (CPRs). CPRs scan all sheep moving to those locations and notify the individual identification numbers of all sheep moved to these premises to my Department where the data is retained.</p></reply>

Payments were based on the number of electronic tags included in the first eligible order, with &euro;1 paid in respect of each electronic tag ordered.  I currently have no plans to re-introduce this scheme for sheep.</p><p>I have recently announced the introduction of a similar scheme to coincide with a move to mandatory electronic identification of cattle from January 2022 onwards. This financial support will assist farmers in transitioning to this new electronic identification system.</p><p>The intention is that the cattle EID tag scheme will operate over three years (2022 to 2024 inclusive) with the first payments scheduled to take place in Quarter 4 2022 amounting to &euro;2.25 million. Payments in 2022 will be calculated on the number of new EID tag sets purchased from 1st January 2022 at a rate of &euro;1 per new EID tag set.</p><p>There is a maximum payment of &euro;100 per farmer over the life of the scheme and, similar to the Sheep EID Tag Subsidy Scheme, no application process will be required as all required information is available on my Department's systems.</p><p>The cattle scheme is proportionately weighted in favour of smaller producers. Farmers can only order annually the number of new tag sets required commensurate to the number of breeding females in the herd.</p><p>Mandatory bovine EID will be implemented in two stages. From 1<sup>st</sup>January 2022, all approved bovine tag suppliers will be required to supply an EID tag with all new tag orders. Each new tag set will include one EID tag and one tissue tag. From 1<sup>st</sup>July 2022, it shall be a legal requirement on herd keepers to officially identify all new-born calves with a tag set containing an EID tag.</p><p>EID tags will be white in colour. The colour of conventional and tissue tags will remain yellow.</p><p>Mandatory bovine EID will deliver a substantial improvement in the bovine identification system for farmers, livestock marts, slaughter plants, export assembly centres and veterinarians. This initiative aligns with and supports the Food Vision 2030 objective that Ireland will become a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems, enhancing consumer trust in our food systems.</p><p>Further, it will lead to a safer working environment for all stakeholders with less reliance on manual checking of bovine tag numbers.</p></reply>

The Regulations were welcomed by welfare organisations.</p>  <p>  Extracts from the Register of Sellers and Suppliers of Pet Animals and the Register of Premises (name of seller or supplier, registration number and the county of the premises used in connection with the sale and supply of pets) are published on the Department's website at gov.ie - Rules on the Sale, Supply and Advertising of Pet Animals (www.gov.ie).

The Department continues to develop its controls in respect of this legislation and is advancing its plans and approach to effective enforcement, working to achieve full compliance with the regulations on advertising pet animals.</p>  <p>  My Department also participates in the Irish Pet Advertising Advisory Group (IPAAG), a group of animal welfare organisations, veterinary professionals and advertising platforms that address issues in relation to advertising pet animals, and engages with advertising platforms both through that group and bilaterally on the regulations.</p>  <p>  A traceability and verification system has been developed by a website advertising dogs in conjunction with a microchipping company.

Mandatory sanitation felling was a component of this approach in my Department&rsquo;s attempt to eradicate the disease and support ash plantation owners.</p>  <p>  A review of the national policy on ash dieback disease, which involved stakeholder consultation was initiated in 2018 as it was increasingly evident from experience and the latest scientific advice that eradication of Ash Dieback Disease was no longer feasible. The focus of the review was on the policy approach and associated support schemes to evaluate the continued relevance of the national response, and to ensure that the forest owner is provided with a broader range of silvicultural and management options. Following the completion of the review, the Department introduced the Reconstitution and Underplanting Scheme (RUS) in July 2020.</p>  <p>  The scheme opened for applications in June 2020 and to date there have been over 426 applications with 139 approved to date, which demonstrates a healthy interest in the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Department will continue to keep ash dieback under close review, but our focus is very much on implementation of the current Scheme and engaging with applicants.</p></reply>

As recommended by the Task Force, the scheme is open to whitefish vessels in the Polyvalent and Beam Trawl segments of the fishing fleet and provides aid to vessels opting to tie-up for a calendar month during the October to December period, thereby freeing up quota for vessels that remain fishing. Vessels excluded by the UK from the Rockall squid fishery are eligible for an additional month of tie-up. The scheme is proposed for funding under the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is designed to assist those vessels impacted by loss of quota arising from the TCA. Many inshore vessels do not fish quota species and so are not impacted by the TCA quota reductions.  For the inshore vessels that are directly impacted by the TCA quota reductions the Scheme recognises that inshore fishing vessels under 10 metres in length are not required by law to record their catch in EU logbooks and accommodates this by instead allowing these vessels to demonstrate that they meet the EU rules concerning 120 days fishing activity through a combination of a self-declaration and the records of their landings recorded on the Sales Notes System maintained by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.</p></reply>

This unfortunate turn of events has a significant direct impact on the farmer involved and has wider implications for the poultry sector generally. </p>  <p>  Protection and surveillance zones have been put in place where there are additional controls on movement of birds and certain related products, as well as an enhanced level of surveillance. I have also, as a measure to further mitigate the risk of spread, introduced a Statutory Instrument requiring the confinement of all poultry or captive birds such that wild birds and other animals do not have access to them.</p>  <p>  This is the high-risk period (October to April) for the introduction of Avian Influenza (AI) as a result of the migration of wild birds returning to overwinter from areas where AI is widespread. This year a Highly Pathogenic AI (HPAI) with subtype H5N1 is in circulation across Europe, the virus can spread from the wild bird population to poultry farms, through direct contact and through faeces from wild birds infected with the virus. A number of EU Member States and Great Britain have confirmed the virus in both wild birds and poultry. </p>  <p>  Since November HPAI H5N1 has been confirmed by my Department in forty-nine wild birds in counties Kerry, Donegal, Galway, Offaly, Roscommon, Tipperary, Wexford and Waterford under its AI surveillance programme. </p>  <p>  On 17th November, I introduced regulations under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, requiring flock keepers to apply particular bio-security measures for poultry and other captive birds as a precautionary measure against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), as well as a ban on the assembly of birds. </p>  <p>  These Regulations require specific biosecurity measures to be implemented by the keepers of all poultry (and other captive bird) flocks, irrespective of size, to help mitigate the risk of infection of their poultry from the virus and the implementation of additional enhanced biosecurity measures by flock-owners in respect of flocks of 500 birds or more.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to closely monitor and assess the disease situation and is in regular contact with industry stakeholders.</p>  <p>  My officials maintain close contact with their counterparts in the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland in evaluating and managing the risk of avian influenza on the island, working in a collaborative way to mitigate spread of the virus.</p></reply>

In addition, for two results-based field actions (low input grassland and multi-species leys), farmers will be rewarded for the quality of hedgerows and treelines. </p>  <p>  In considering recognition for hedgerow quality, it is important to acknowledge that hedgerows exist in many forms across Irish farms, contributing across a range of carbon and biodiversity values.  </p>  <p>  The EPA and my Department are currently funding the &ldquo;Farm Carbon&rdquo; research project. It is investigating the carbon sequestration potential of different types of Irish hedgerows.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Farm Environmental Study Programme is due to commence next year with the objective of developing a national baseline database of farm scale habitat and biodiversity data, along with additional environmental parameters.

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth allocates core funding for the FRC Programme and, since 2019, this funding amount has been a total of &euro;18m each year. Tusla provides core funding to 121 FRCs in marginalised communities throughout the country, which enables centres to leverage broader community support and access funding from other sources. Tusla encourages FRCs to access all funding streams that may be available to them, particularly where a FRC may have an area of interest aligned to another Government Department or State body. The range of services and supports in FRCs differs from centre to centre, and may depend on areas of interest in the community. </p><p>In exchange for annual funding, FRCs sign a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with Tusla on an annual basis, and agree to provide a specified level of service to those who may require its services. FRCs operate independently of Tusla. The management of an FRC is a matter for the Board of Management of that FRC. Tusla assesses the agreed levels of service, and how that service is being provided, through the annual SLA process.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated financial pressures for many services in the voluntary sector, including FRCs. In 2021, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth provided an additional &euro;7m to some 700 community and voluntary organisations funded by Tusla, including FRCs. FRCs have shown tireless commitment and real innovation in providing services in response to the needs of families at this time. All FRCs have been allocated an additional once-off 5% funding increase in recognition of this. Additionally, a further &euro;618,000 was made available to FRCs in each of 2020 and 2021 from funding through the Dormant Accounts Action Plans for those years. This will allow FRCs to carry out maintenance works, to purchase essential equipment and furnishings, and undertake additional works and service developments required to respond to the impact of COVID-19.</p><p>The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is committed to working with colleagues in Government, Tusla and across the FRC Programme to ensure the sustainability of FRC services to meet the needs of children, young people and their families across Ireland.</p><p>From my own Department&rsquo;s perspective, in 2020 and 2021, funding was awarded to more than 800 organisations to continue to deliver vital services to the most vulnerable in our communities, through the <b>COVID-19 Stability Fund for Community and Voluntary Organisations, Charities and Social Enterprises.</b>While this scheme is now closed, I was pleased to award &euro;50,442 to the organisation in question under this fund in 2020.</p><p>My Department currently supports the organisation in question under the Community Services Programme (CSP), which supports the provision of employment opportunities and the delivery of local services, through a social enterprise model.  The organisation receives funding of &euro;146,198 per annum towards the cost of supporting one manager and six full time equivalent positions.  </p><p>In response to the difficulties faced by organisations due to COVID-19, my Department developed a &euro;7.95m CSP Support Fund which assisted CSP supported organisations to continue to retain their CSP supported employees on their payroll, provided assistance for the employers&rsquo; PRSI contribution, during this crisis period up to June 2021 and also assisted those organisations most in need to meet their ongoing operational costs such as insurance, light and heat and audit fees.  I can confirm that the organisation has received additional funding of &euro;8,211 during 2021 under the CSP Support Fund. </p><p>I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that a &euro;1m extension to the CSP Support Fund was approved to cover the period 1 July to 30 November 2021 to provide further assistance to those organisations considered most in need, in line with other Government Wage Support Schemes.  This extension to the Support Fund is being administered on behalf of my Department by Pobal and eligibility will be determined based on the information available on the organisation&rsquo;s financial position, as determined by Pobal and the Department. Pobal will administer payments to those deemed eligible under this extension of the CSP Support Fund over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The programme supports private enterprises and community groups in rural areas.</p>  <p>  From 2007 to 2020, LEADER was included in the suite of measures that constituted Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme (RDP).  The Rural Development Programmes agreed by each Member State with the EU Commission were designed to correspond to specified Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) programming periods.  The CAP programming periods in turn correspond to the EU's budgetary cycle.  The Rural Development Programme will now be replaced by each Member State&rsquo;s CAP Strategic Plan.  </p>  <p>  As part of the 2007 to 2013 CAP programming period, LEADER was included as a number of linked measures under Axis 4 of the RDP.  The LEADER allocation for the 2007 to 2013 CAP programming period was almost &euro;400 million. This was subsequently revised in 2013, due to a downturn in the national economy, to &euro;377m on foot of the agreement by the EU Commission of a formal amendment to the 2007-2013 RDP.  Contracts for delivery of LEADER interventions were signed by Local Action Groups from January, 2009 with preparatory financial support provided in advance of that.</p>  <p>  For the 2014-2020 CAP programming period, LEADER was included as Measure 19 of the RDP. The LEADER allocation for the 2014 to 2020 CAP programming period was &euro;250 million.  Contracts for delivery of LEADER interventions were signed by Local Action Groups from July 2016, with preparatory financial support provided in advance of that.</p>  <p>  The next CAP programming period was due to run from 2021 to 2027.  However, due to delays in agreeing the required regulations at EU level, a transition period was agreed for the years 2021 and 2022.  &euro;70m has been assigned to LEADER in this transition period.  An indicative allocation of &euro;180m has recently being announced for LEADER for the years 2023 to 2027, bringing the total allocated for LEADER to the original 2021 to 2027 CAP programming period to &euro;250m.</p></reply>
