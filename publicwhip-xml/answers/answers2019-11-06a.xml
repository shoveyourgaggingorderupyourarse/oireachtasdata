This topic has been one of interest in Ireland in light of a demand for a more varied night landscape and a recognition of the cultural, economic and social value of Ireland's evening experiences.  It is also building on the back of movements across Europe such as Museum Night and, for example, the appointment of a "night tzar" in London. </p>  <p>  My Department has been working with key partners to develop an approach to support a sustainable and forward looking infrastructure to facilitate the development of after-hours cultural events.  In addition to local pilot projects and a national forum to consider the matter of night time culture in a comprehensive way, I am finalising plans to engage with local authorities and arts groups with regard to a mapping exercise of existing venues and civic spaces which may be suitable for night time cultural events to identify both gaps and opportunities, building on work done in this area to date.  The exact methodology and approach to this mapping exercise is also being finalised. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have recently written to selected local authorities with a view to establishing local interest groups to examine the potential for night time cultural events.</p>  <p>  The main goal of these local groups will be to produce a report on what supports and impediments are currently impacting on opportunities for creative and cultural activity at night, both positive and challenging.  The report will also propose practical locally-based initiatives to improve night-time culture. This report will then feed into a National Forum which is envisaged to comprise relevant Government Departments and Agencies.  It is intended that this National Forum will meet upon receipt of local reports to consider matters arising for referral to the relevant Government Department or agency.</p></reply>

This is similar to the amount it received in 2019.</p><p>The voted funding allocation to the Heritage Council each year is published in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s Revised Estimates Volume. Funding for the Heritage Council has increased by almost 40% since 2015. The amounts published from 2015 to 2019 are as follows:</p><p>2015 - &euro;4.743 million</p><p>2016 - &euro;5.243 million</p><p>2017 - &euro;6.254 million</p><p>2018 - &euro;6.377 million</p><p>2019 - &euro;6.588 million</p><p>The Heritage Council operates a range of programmes which impact positively on employment within the heritage and tourism sectors, on education and on promotion of heritage. The Heritage Council is independent in the performance of its functions and it is, therefore, primarily a matter for the Heritage Council itself to decide how its funding is allocated across the research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  The Historic Towns Initiative (HTI), however, is a joint undertaking between my Department and the Heritage Council. It provides support to historic towns engaged in a programme of heritage-led regeneration. Earlier this year, along with the Heritage Council, I announced funding of &euro;1 million, to be shared by six towns under the 2019 programme.  This funding will be retained in 2020.</p><p>The Heritage Council is entering a new phase in its development with the appointment of a new CEO on the 1st of February. The new CEO will oversee the implementation of the Heritage Council&rsquo;s Strategic Plan <i>Heritage at the Heart</i><i>2018-2022.</i></p><p>The Heritage Council&rsquo;s budget must also be viewed in its wider context. My Department is currently in the process of drafting Heritage Ireland 2030, a new national heritage plan, which will identify and assign priorities for the funding designated under Project Ireland 2040 for investment in our built and natural heritage. Heritage Ireland 2030 will provide an overarching framework of values, principles and strategic priorities to guide, inform and resource the heritage sector at all levels over the next decade.</p></reply>

No. 477/2011), both of which prohibit the spreading of invasive species.</p><p>There is significant work being carried out by my Department in this area in conjunction with a range of agencies, including by a number of local authorities. The National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department have prepared Management Plans for invasive species of EU concern and Priority Pathway Action Plans are also being developed to address the major routes of entry of invasive species into Ireland. My Department continues to work closely with colleagues in the UK and across the EU to manage the risks associated with Invasive Alien Species.</p><p>My Department has also worked closely over the years with the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) to fund and manage the Invasive Species Ireland Project.  Information on general management approaches to invasive plant species is available from the Invasive Species Ireland website: invasivespeciesireland.com ()</p><p>In addition, the Management of Invasive Alien Plant Species (IAPS), launched in 2016 and led by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, is a &euro;5.5 million project aimed at managing invasive knotweed and other non-native invasive plant species on the national road network and its interactions with regional roads. The project involves collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (DTTAS). </p><p>In 2018 my Department piloted a targeted grant scheme for local authorities to assist with the implementation of actions contained in the National Biodiversity Action Plan. This scheme included a funding stream to specifically target invasive alien species. The scheme was rolled out again in 2019 with increased funding and grants have been awarded to a range of projects across the 28 Local Authorities who applied.</p><p>While my Department does not collect data from local authorities on the incidence of specific invasive species in their areas, information on the distribution of invasive species in Ireland is available on the invasive species section of the National Biodiversity Data Centre (NBDC) website at .</p></reply>

Funding under both the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and Historic Structures Fund is made available under Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>While the primary responsibility to care for and maintain a protected structure rests with the owner, the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and Historic Structures Fund invest essential capital in our valuable built heritage and help the owners and custodians of historic structures in every local authority area across the country to safeguard their properties into the future for the benefit of communities and the public<b>.</b></p><p>The Built Heritage Investment Scheme is a scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures on the local authority Record of Protected Structures. It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople. I allocated funding of &euro;2.5m for this Scheme in 2019; this included &euro;60,000 for 15 projects in County Clare. The Built Heritage Investment Scheme is administered through the local authorities.</p><p>The Historic Structures Fund, (formerly the Structures at Risk Fund) is for conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership. I allocated &euro;1.824m for the Historic Structures Fund in 2019, and this included &euro;15,000 to one project in County Clare. The Historic Structures Fund is administered through the local authorities.</p><p>In 2019, 478 built heritage projects were successful in their application to the Built Heritage Investment Scheme and the Historic Structures Fund. Details of all projects approved under both these funding schemes are published on my Department&rsquo;s website as well as on local authority websites.</p><p>I will shortly be announcing details of the Built Heritage Investment Scheme 2020 and the Historic Structures Fund 2020.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-06a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600054#WRB02200"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, RT&Eacute; commissioned a report from independent consultants Helen Boaden and Mediatique on the RT&Eacute; Orchestras entitled RT&Eacute; Orchestras Ensuring a Sustainable Future.  The Report made a number of recommendations including that the RT&Eacute; National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) be a national cultural institution in its own right or within the National Concert Hall (NCH).  </p>  <p>  My Department, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, the National Concert Hall and RT&Eacute; considered the Report and were all of the view that the RT&Eacute; National Symphony Orchestra should come within the remit of the National Concert Hall and should not be established as a separate body.  </p>  <p>  The main reasons for this are as follows:</p>  <p>  -  The NSO has been located in the NCH since it opened in 1981 and it provides the backbone to the Hall's orchestral music programme. </p>  <p>  -  To the public at large the NCH and the NSO are already intrinsically linked and the aims of both are entirely compatible. </p>  <p>  -  The recently announced capital investment plan for the NCH includes enhanced and additional facilities for the NSO, incorporating a dedicated rehearsal studio. </p>  <p>  -  The support services for an orchestra and a concert hall significantly overlap: programming, education and outreach, finance, operations, marketing and communications, personnel, and fundraising.</p>  <p>  -  Finally a combined creative and imaginative overall programme strategy will greatly enhance the offering of both organisations to the public.</p>  <p>  At its meeting on 5 July 2018 the Government  agreed in principle that the NSO should come within the remit of the National Concert Hall.  The Government  also authorised the initiation of discussions on the implementation of the recommendations of the Boaden report.  </p>  <p>  The overall aim of the Government decision in relation to the proposed transfer of the RT&Eacute; NSO is to enable the orchestra to be established as a world class orchestra which would, with the NCH, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that would greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public. I was pleased to secure funding of &euro;1m as part of Budget 2020 towards the cost of the proposed transfer in 2020. </p>  <p>  In addition to this there are currently a number of other musical organisations located at the National Concert Hall - the Chamber Choir Ireland, the Irish Baroque Orchestra, Crash Ensemble, Music Network and Music Generation. The work of these organisations complements that of the NSO and represents a broad spread of artistic output across the classical music spectrum that is at the core of the remit of the NCH. </p></reply>

Funding for the Arts Council has been increasing steadily in recent years and it will reach &euro;80 million in 2020.  This is an increase &euro;5m or 6.7% over 2019.  The Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003, operates within a published 10 year strategic framework entitled Making Great Art Work. This strategy prioritises support for artists throughout their careers, by the involvement of many agencies in cultural provision, by the impact of the arts on the creative economy, and by the depth and breadth of people's engagement with the arts.  The additional funding will allow the Arts Council to enhance its support for all artists, arts festivals, street arts and family events.</p>  <p>  In addition, over &euro;7m will be available from my Department next year to support the European City of Culture, Galway 2020.  This is a significant sum to support artistic and creative activities in 2020.  </p>  <p>  The remit of Culture Ireland, a division of my Department, is to promote and advance Irish arts worldwide thus strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s cultural profile and global reputation.  Strategic priorities include providing support for the international presentation of Irish artists and arts organisations, developing new and diverse international audiences and markets for Irish arts, and linking culture into the Government&rsquo;s international promotion strategy in tandem with other relevant Government Agencies. Critically, the work of Culture Ireland is focused on increasing career opportunities for Irish artists. </p>  <p>  This Budget has been framed in the context of Brexit and additional funding for our arts and culture, at a time of prudent budgetary management reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to supporting Irish arts and artists.  The Per Cent for Arts Scheme and the extension of the Social Welfare Scheme for Self Employed Artists in conjunction with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection announced earlier is further proof of our commitment. </p>  <p>  My Department and I will continue to work with all of my Government colleagues towards delivering on the commitment to increase Government spending in the arts and culture sector on a trajectory that will see funding doubled by 2025.  I am already delivering additional supports to the arts and culture sector, building on the &euro;1.2 billion earmarked for culture, heritage and the Irish language under Project Ireland 2040, thus leading to increased activity and employment across all sectors under the remit of my Department.</p></reply>

No. 477/2011), both of which prohibit the spreading of invasive species. Work is also underway in my Department to implement the EU Invasive Alien Species Regulation (No. 1143/2014) in the national context and legislation to do this is at an advanced draft stage. </p>  <p>  Under the current legislative framework, responsibility for invasive alien species rests, in the first instance, with landowners. Throughout my Department&rsquo;s 87,000 hectare network of National Parks and nature Reserves, tackling invasive species such as Rhododendron ponticum, Japanese Knotweed and Giant Hogweed is an ongoing operational matter. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, my Department has invested circa &euro;1.4m to tackle rhododendron clearance in Killarney National Park alone. This is in addition to separate investments throughout Glenveagh, Connemara and Wild Nephin / Ballycroy National Park and in a number of Nature Reserves. </p>  <p>  Clearance work is carried out across various NPWS sites directly by our staff and also in certain instances by contractors.  With regard to combatting these invasive species, glyphosate is one of the most effective means of killing problematic invasive plant species, and it is an essential herbicide in the control of other noxious weeds. NPWS invasive species eradication programmes over many years have mainly focussed on injection of herbicide into the plant, or application onto cuts made in the stems, rather than spraying, both of which greatly reduce the quantity used and human contact with the herbicide. </p>  <p>  Eradication of invasive alien species, once they become established, is usually difficult to achieve and resources are best used to promote awareness, prevent introduction of invasive alien species and, where a species has established itself, put in place effective and appropriate management measures to mitigate the effects of the species on native habitats and species. </p>  <p>  Raising awareness of invasive alien species and the threat that they pose to native biodiversity is an important component of my Department's work in this area. In 2018, a new stream of grant funding for local authorities was piloted. This funding is to assist local authorities to support projects that support actions in the National Biodiversity Action Plan, including those that target invasive alien species in their areas. In 2019, &euro;500,000 was allocated to the 28 local authorities who applied. Grant funding of &euro;700,000 will be available in 2020.</p></reply>

In addition, the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 include provisions affording strict protection to a number of species and habitats. </p>  <p>  Wildlife crime takes many forms ranging from persecution of badgers, illegal hunting of deer species, illegal hunting of hares with packs of dogs generally known as lurchers, trapping of wild birds such as native finches for illegal trade, wilfully disturbing or destroying the eggs or nests of wild birds, poisoning of raptor species and the illegal cutting of hedges during the nesting season for birds.  </p>  <p>  While much wildlife crime is local we should not underestimate the dangers involved in investigating it as many perpetrators have links with other more serious crime.  </p>  <p>  Within my Department, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has responsibility for the protection and conservation of Ireland&rsquo;s natural heritage, including species protection and biodiversity at national level.  The NPWS is therefore dedicated to looking after our species and habitats and NPWS frontline conservation Rangers are deployed through a regional structure.  Some of their work entails scientific research and survey work and the monitoring of compliance with national and European law in relation to nature conservation and wildlife crime across the country. The team also conduct patrols and site visits to enforce the various provisions of national and EU legislation and investigate reports of breaches of legislation including the various types of wildlife crime I have already described. My Department works closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are also specifically empowered under the Acts to investigate alleged wildlife crime offences and to prosecute as they see fit. </p>  <p>  In the period 2013 to date in 2019 some 80 prosecutions were taken by my Department for breaches of the Wildlife Acts.   As far as counties Galway and Mayo are concerned thirteen individuals have been convicted of breaches of the Wildlife Acts since 2013 in these two counties.  In fact there were two recent successful prosecutions this year for illegal hare lurching by individuals in county Mayo.  While bringing perpetrators of crime to justice is important, the success of dealing with wildlife crime cannot be judged on this alone, as ensuring compliance in the first instance is clearly of critical importance.</p>  <p>   Given the concerns that I have surrounding the apparent widespread nature of wildlife crime, an internal Wildlife Crime Group staffed by field staff and senior Departmental officials which meets regularly most recently last week. The Wildlife Crime Group has pursued many important initiatives including the organisation of a major Wildlife Crime Conference last year which was attended by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and representatives from organisations in Britain and Northern Ireland dealing with wildlife crime. </p>  <p>  I am also committed to ensuring that we continue our covert actions with other agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the I.S.P.C.A to counteract these illegal activities.</p></reply>

The Wildlife Acts afford protection to a range of habitats and species and provide for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity, such as hunting and trade.</p>  <p>  The legislative framework in place to protect our natural heritage is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 SI No 477/2011, which also fall under the remit of my Department. These Regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union, giving a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State. The main instruments provided for are the designation of Special Protection Areas (SPA), aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds, and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats.</p>  <p>  Under Article 12 of the EU Birds Directive (2009/147/EC), Member States report on the implementation of the directive and the trends in bird populations. My Department submitted Ireland&rsquo;s 3rd assessment on the status of EU-protected habitats and species to the European Commission in April 2019. A summary report has just been published which provides an overview of the assessment methodologies and the main findings of the assessments are available on my Department's website (www.npws.ie/sites/default/files/publications/pdf/NPWS_2019_Vol1_Summary_Article17.pdf).</p>  <p>  These very thorough assessments were undertaken by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of this Department, Inland Fisheries Ireland and external experts.</p>  <p>  The aim of the EU Habitats Directive is to contribute towards the conservation of biodiversity by requiring Member States to take measures to maintain or restore natural habitats and wild species listed on the Directive. They have been listed because they are considered vulnerable at a Union level. Ireland has 59 habitats and 68 species listed on the Directive. Ireland&rsquo;s 3rd assessment on the status of listed habitats and species was submitted by my Department to the European Commission in April 2019. A summary report has also been published and is available on the NPWS website (www.npws.ie/publications/article-17-reports). In addition, detailed reports have been published, exceeding 2,000 pages of assessments. These assessments were undertaken by over 40 scientific experts.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to drive targeted conservation work throughout the country and co-ordinates a number of EU-funded LIFE nature projects. KerryLIFE, a project worth over &euro;5 million to support two local communities in the Caragh and Kerry Blackwater areas, for instance, is focussed on helping restore populations of the endangered freshwater pearl mussel.</p>  <p>  The NPWS Farm Plan Scheme of my Department offers a mechanism for engaging with individuals in a joint conservation effort. The scheme will be enhanced in 2020 to support measures to protect biodiversity and assist farmers with lands designated as Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas in their role as custodians of nature.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the huge voluntary commitment by all concerned. </p>  <p>  Among the main recommendations of the report are that:</p>  <p>  -  there is an urgent need to secure the fabric of the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and that the MSAG confirms its support for the OPW to advance this process as soon as possible;</p>  <p>  -  my Department should develop a scoping document on the potential for an increased State and State supported heritage and culture presence in the area;</p>  <p>  -  an expert group should be appointed by Dublin City Council to lead the urgent regeneration of the Moore Street market; and</p>  <p>  -  the MSAG should be reconfigured to a smaller more focussed group in order to move the process forward as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Work is in progress on all of these recommendations.  My Department is liaising with the Office of Public Works with a view to progressing the completion of the conservation of the national monument buildings so that they can be opened for presentation to the public.  The Irish Heritage Trust has been engaged to develop the scoping document referred to in the report and will have the full support of my Department's officials in this regard. I can also confirm that I have asked Dublin City Council to act on the recommendation for the expert group to lead the regeneration of the street market and I understand that this is in course of being set up. I would also shortly hope to appoint a chair to lead the next phase of the MSAG's work.</p>  <p>  I regard the Securing History 2 report as a significant milestone in the revitalisation of this crucial part of our capital city. The proposals put forward by Hammerson are sympathetic to and embrace the history and heritage of O&rsquo;Connell Street and the Moore Street area and can be aligned with the objectives of protecting the national monument at Nos. 14 -17, opening it to the public and resonating the mercantile, social and political heritage of the area as a 1916 commemorative quarter. I understand that a recent statement from the Moore Street Traders Association has expressed its members' full backing for the proposals which it sees as providing an important opportunity for their businesses to become viable again. </p>  <p>  I welcome the prospect there now is for reviving the Moore Street area and its market and to give Dublin a national main street and historic area to be proud of. </p></reply>

Any queries in respect to such a designation should be pursued with OPW. Through its National Parks and Wildlife Service, my Department manages an extensive conservation and recreational property portfolio of some 87,000 hectares, which includes 6 National Parks.  I have no plans at present to designate any further National Parks.</p>  <p>  The IUCN, also known as the World Conservation Union which is affiliated to the United Nations, is the international authority which sets the criteria for the protected areas of the world. All of Ireland's six National Parks are managed as Category II National Parks under the criteria set out by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). Under this Category, ownership and management should normally be by the highest competent authority of the State and there is a minimum size associated with such designations. Accordingly, all National Parks in Ireland are fully owned and managed by the State through the National Parks and Wildlife Service Division (NPWS) of the Department. It is the policy of my Department to abide by the criteria and standards for the National Parks laid down by the IUCN.</p>  <p>  Our 6 existing National Parks account for circa 65,000 hectares with another almost 22,000 hectares of nature reserves and other heritage sites. The existing National Parks are managed from a conservation perspective, and attract in excess of 4 million visitors annually. Given the resources available for capital investment within our National Parks and Nature Reserves, I am ever mindful of the need to focus on the core responsibilities relating to the management of the existing Parks and Reserves lands and have no plans at present to increase the number of National Parks in the country.</p>  <p>  However, as part of my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and improving our tourism and recreation product, we have been exploring ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives.</p>  <p>  In this context, it should be noted that in late 2016 my Department negotiated the extension of Wicklow Mountains National Park by purchasing almost 4,900 acres of Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost of &euro;800,000. The purchase underpins the Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to the preservation of our natural heritage for future generations of citizens and visitors alike to enjoy.</p>  <p>  In 2017 the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This creates a State &ndash; Owned wilderness project of over 11,000 hectares and aims to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as  enhanced recreational and social benefits through the &lsquo;re-wilding&rsquo; of the forest which adjoins the National Park. Thanks to the acquisition, we will be returning the area to a natural wilderness state.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, launched a strategic partnership in 2017 with a view to growing tourism revenues in the rural areas where the parks are located and increasing Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a recreation destination.  One of the outputs from the partnership with F&aacute;ilte was &ldquo;Experiencing the Wild Heart of Ireland&rdquo;; an interpretative masterplan for the development of our National Parks and Reserves, which was published last year and sets out a road map for investment at these important nature conservation, public amenity and tourism sites and underpins the objectives of Project 2040. </p>  <p>  The investment in our National Parks will create memorable and meaningful experiences of Ireland&rsquo;s landscapes, wildlife and culture. This will be done though sensitive design and the development of authentic experiences, providing better access to nature and an increased understanding of society&rsquo;s conservation responsibilities, as well as supporting significant investment in recreational facilities including upgrading and development of the trails network, increased visitor facilities and improved signage and branding. These will be designed and delivered with a strong emphasis on conservation and allow us protect and preserve our most fragile environments and investing in our culture, language &amp;amp; heritage provide a well-being benefit for all.</p>  <p>  In this regard, a provision of some &euro;5million in funding, for 32 individual projects across the network of NPWS sites, was announced earlier this year as part of the Rural Regeneration Development Fund.  Therefore, while I have no plans to expand the Park network at present, my Department is actively ensuring the preservation, protection and presentation of the assets we already own.</p></reply>

It was wonderful to see Eyre Square come to life with the large crowd in attendance and the breath-taking performance by composer and musician Anna Mullarkey and the French aerialists Gratte Ciella.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the cultural programme that was launched that evening is arranged according to the old Celtic calendar with over 1900 events spread over the course of the year, starting with the opening ceremony in the first week of February, which will travel over six days from towns across the county to culminate in the city on 8 February. </p>  <p>  Following the recent third and final review by the EU Expert Monitoring Panel, Galway 2020 was also recommended for the prestigious Melina Mercouri Prize of &euro;1.5 million.

This open consultation process will allow plenty of opportunity for all communities, stakeholders and citizens to have their say. We will invite online and written submissions, and social media engagement, alongside a series of workshops and meetings to allow the public to become involved in the drafting of the new policy. It will also include engagement with key bodies and organisations representing those working in the area to ensure their views are heard.</p>  <p>  The discussion document for the consultation phase was prepared by my officials of my Department in close consultation with a committee representing the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Education and Skills, the Office of Public Works, the Health Service Executive, the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, the schools of architecture and the Irish Architecture Foundation. It will illustrate, and seek comments on, the main ways in which architecture and our built environment affect society, our health and wellbeing and our ability to prosper.

It also referred to over 30 ongoing projects funded under the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund (RRDF). </p>  <p>  My Department frequently liaises with other relevant bodies and agencies on an ongoing basis to determine what potential projects could benefit from available funding schemes such as the RRDF, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland programmes. EU programmes are also considered as potential contributors to the enhancement, use and protection of Ireland&rsquo;s heritage, taking into account the suitability and relevance of the recommended projects and timelines for such programmes. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) assists the repair and conservation of protected structures - in public and private ownership - on the local authority Record of Protected Structures. It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small-scale conservation projects and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople. I allocated funding of &euro;2.5m for the BHIS in 2019. The Historic Structures Fund (formerly the Structures at Risk Fund) is for larger conservation works to such protected structures. I allocated &euro;1.824m for the HSF in 2019. Both the BHIS and the HSF are administered through the local authorities. Details of the 2020 schemes will be announced in the coming days. The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage. The types of structures referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question would have the potential to be covered under such schemes.  </p>  <p>  As the representative for the World Heritage Convention on behalf of Ireland, my Department is responsible for the submission of nomination documentation to UNESCO for inclusion of properties on the World Heritage (WH) List. Opening the 2020 Tentative List for WH earlier this year, the National Monuments Service has been working closely with Local Authorities and Stakeholders to guide the application process and subsequent preparation for eventual WH nomination, which includes the long term conservation and protection of such sites and the promotion of their national and international interest. Inclusion on the Tentative List is an opportunity for statutory, voluntary and community organisations to take stock of the naturally and culturally significant heritage resources in their locality.</p></reply>

The Per Cent for Arts Scheme and the extension of the Social Welfare Scheme for Self Employed Artists in conjunction with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection announced earlier is further proof of our commitment.</p></reply>

However, I understand that in 1999 the local authority, as part of the Planning and Development Act, designated Howth peninsula a &ldquo;special amenity area&rdquo;.  Accordingly, the Deputy would need to refer this part of his question to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, the area the Deputy refers to is designated as both a Special Area of Conservation and a Special Protection Area (Howth Head SAC and Howth Head Coast SPA) and as such is afforded statutory protections in respect of developments within the designated areas in line with all such conservation areas nationally.</p>  <p>  As previously outlined to the Deputy in my response to his parliamentary question no 8549/19 earlier this year,  my Department has no plans to create a national park in the wilderness area of Howth. As I already indicated, all Irish National Parks are fully state owned and meet category II of the IUCN standard for national parks.  There is a minimum size associated with such designations and it is unlikely that this area would qualify.</p></reply>

To direct this investment, my Department has developed a detailed sectoral investment plan, <i>Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage</i>, which sets the high-level, strategic capital priorities for the Department from 2018 to 2027.  This plan involves three types of investment activity; capital investment and infrastructure programmes, capital grant schemes and major capital projects. </p><p>The plan provides for an allocation of: </p><p>-  &euro;725 million towards enhancing our cultural infrastructure, incorporating, </p><p>-  A &euro;460 million investment in our National Cultural Institutions and, </p><p>-  &euro;265 million for a national Culture and Creativity Investment Programme; </p><p>-  &euro;285 million towards a heritage investment programme; and, </p><p>-  &euro;178 million towards investment in our language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands. </p><p>Major capital projects under the National Cultural Institutions programme of the plan are appraised, planned, implemented and evaluated in line with the Public Spending Code and best practice guidance outlined in the Capital Works Management Framework published by the Office of Government Procurement. </p><p>While the majority of these capital projects are moving through the appraisal stage, we are currently providing support for two major capital projects: a four-year redevelopment of the National Library of Ireland involving the upgrading of the East and West Wings of the Library, and the provision of secure environmentally-controlled archival repository at the National Archives. The projects are being carried out by the Office of Public Works in partnership with the National Library of Ireland and the National Archives.</p><p>The first phase of the National Library of Ireland redevelopment project, comprising the development of a new book repository in the East Wing of the Library comprising 4,700 linear metres of storage and the movement of 350,000 volumes, was completed in June. The final outturn for phase 1 of the National Library of Ireland project is currently being prepared. </p><p>Enabling works to prepare for the construction work at the National Archives were completed in June. It is intended to undertake the tender for the National Archives Repository Redevelopment in the coming months. </p><p>My Department is also progressing a range of other initiatives under the other two strands of investment activity (grant schemes and investment programmes) which are delivering improved cultural, heritage and linguistic infrastructure and investment to communities across Ireland.  These other initiatives currently underway include the investment in new trails and way paths across our network of National Parks and Nature Reserves, delivery of local arts and cultural facility enhancements under the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme, and the upgrading of community and childcare facilities in Gaeltacht areas.  Partnership and collaboration are core principles underpinning these and other initiatives under the programme, and the Department is currently working with the Heritage Council, Waterways Ireland, Screen Ireland, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and local authorities to deliver on its investment programme.&lsquo; </p></reply>

The plan sets out significant investment on a phased basis over the next 10 years prioritised across 3 areas - &euro;785m for Culture; &euro;295m for Heritage and &euro;178m for our Language. The scale of the investment in our cultural infrastructure is unprecedented and will deepen our cultural and heritage foundations. It will also allow us to create world-class cultural institutions.</p>  <p>  This capital investment is especially important in relation to the Abbey Theatre, as the building in which the National Theatre is housed is over 50 years old and is widely recognised as deficient in the facilities it provides for artists, audiences and staff and in terms of its energy efficiency. The redevelopment will also honour the theatre&rsquo;s history and legacy, whilst matching the national theatres of other European capital cities while the Abbey Theatre&rsquo;s additional aim is to accelerate regeneration of the Theatre&rsquo;s neighbourhood to transition into an even more attractive destination for leisure, eating, drinking and shopping. </p>  <p>  Last week, I was delighted to announce the progression of the Abbey Theatre Redevelopment Project to detailed appraisal stage. The &euro;80m indicative investment in the project will facilitate a fitting redevelopment, contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a centre for theatre as well as revitalising a key area in Dublin city centre. The planning and construction of a facility as large as this has a significant lead-in time.  </p>  <p>  The project is still at an early stage but the Abbey Theatre will now engage experts to prepare the detailed appraisal documentation required under the Public Spending Code, which will include economic and financial reviews as well as risk assessments.  On completion of a positive Business Case, the project will move to design and a future vision for the theatre.  It is expected that the Business Case will be completed in mid-2020.</p>  <p>  Having a world-class cultural and heritage infrastructure will strengthen our international reputation and I look forward to seeing the Abbey Theatre Redevelopment Project progress over the coming months and years.</p></reply>

This project is important for the border region with potential to stimulate economic activity, giving a much needed boost to job creation and with the growth in water based tourism helping to attract significant numbers of visitors to the area.  </p>  <p>  Government approval for Phase 1 of this project, to restore a 2.5 km stretch of the Ulster Canal from Upper Lough Erne in County Fermanagh to the International Scout Centre at Castle Saunderson near Belturbet in Co. Cavan, was secured in February 2015.</p>  <p>  Work on Phase 1 is nearing completion and includes dredging works to the River Finn, construction of a new navigation arch at Derrykerrib Bridge and installation of a new mooring facility at Castlesaunderson.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland anticipates expenditure in 2019 of &euro;53,500 to complete payment for works at Derrykerrib and &euro;100,000 for construction works for Castlesaunderson public moorings.</p>  <p>  The expenditure to date, including commitments amounts to &euro;3,960,000 which is fully funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland has worked with Cavan County Council in relation to recreational amenities at the Council site at Castlesaunderson, including a public jetty.  A contract for the construction of this new floating jetty was substantially completed in October 2019. The jetty will be operational for the 2020 boating season. This capital investment in navigational infrastructure will create a welcome new destination for waterway users of both the Erne System and the Shannon &ndash; Erne Waterway. It is expected to bring a new awareness, interest and additional visitors to the river and to the border area around Castlesaunderson.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the Ulster Canal Phase 2 - Restoration of Ulster Canal Lough Erne to Clones &ndash; The Clones Terminus Project is under development with anticipated cost of &euro;433,000 of which 75% is funded from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, with 25% funded by my Department. Currently Waterways Ireland is in preparation for planning, if required, with a tender process completed for a feasibility study relating to a sustainable water supply. In addition Waterways Ireland, supported by Monaghan County Council, is preparing a tender for identification of optimum methods of delivering recreational and broader benefits from the proposed investment in the canal in Clones.  It is currently planned to spend this funding during 2019 and 2020.</p>  <p>  Waterways Ireland is also continuing work with the partners Monaghan County Council, Armagh City Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, East Border Region Ltd. and Mid Ulster District Council to develop 22km of greenway along the Ulster Canal towpath from Smithborough, Co. Monaghan and Middletown, Co. Armagh, funded through the successful application to the Interreg VA sustainable transport measure (circa &euro;5.0m). An Integrated Consultant Team was appointed in June 2019 and work is progressing on preparation for planning.</p>  <p>  Public consultation events were held in three locations in August and September 2019. Waterways Ireland and partners have also produced an Ulster Canal Greenway strategy which sets out how this greenway could become the spine of a robust network of off-road greenways across this rural border region.</p></reply>

While plans are still evolving, I expect to be in a position to publish a substantive commemorative programme for 2020 in January and indicative plans for subsequent years.  I have allocated current funding of &euro;2 million to support the Decade of Centenaries programme in 2020, which is a funding increase of &euro;900,000 above the 2019 allocation.  </p>  <p>  My Department has built significant partnerships with key stakeholders, including local authorities, the national cultural institutions, institutions of learning and custodians of records, the trade union movement and creative communities.  All of these will have an important role in supporting the national conversation about the events of this period and encouraging respectful public discourse and debate.  </p>  <p>  The approaching centenaries present particularly sensitive and complex challenges.  I firmly believe that the cultural heritage and stories of all traditions on the island of Ireland must be preserved and told. My primary objective in developing plans for the remainder of the Decade of Centenaries, is to ensure that we promote peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland by encouraging a deeper understanding of the significance of this period, which accepts that the shared historical experiences of those years gave rise to very different narratives and memories.  </p>  <p>  My plans for the forthcoming period will continue to be informed by the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations and developed in consultation with the All Party Consultation Group on Commemorations.</p></reply>

Because they are treated separately for tax purposes, credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.  </p>  <p>  The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.  </p>  <p>  To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples. </p>  <p>  I have been advised by Revenue that from a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased.  There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them. </p>  <p>  The issue raised by the Deputy's question arose during the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill yesterday (5 November 2019). Following on from  this, my Department is to prepare a report in advance of the Report Stage of the Bill. </p></reply>

The levy was designed to claw back a small amount of the very generous tax reliefs that those contributing to pension arrangements had benefitted from over many years. The levy went to fund the tax reductions and expenditure measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative, including lowering the VAT rate for the tourism sector to 9%. </p>  <p>  The levy was successful, as reflected in the increased activity and employment in that sector. The trustees of pension schemes affected by the levy had the option of adjusting current or prospective scheme benefits to take account of the levies, which included the possibility of reducing future retirement benefits.  </p>  <p>  For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 the rate was 0.60% of the pension scheme assets. For the year 2014 the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. The levy has ceased since 2015.</p>  <p>  The value of the funds raised by way of the levies have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improving financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed onto will have since benefited from tax reductions in the last number of Budgets. </p></reply>

Reduced rates of USC apply for those aged over 70 with total annual income of less than &euro;60,000. This ensures that the highest rate of USC paid on income is 2%. </p>  <p>  There is no charge to PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance) for those aged over 66. </p>  <p>  Additionally, a person aged 65 and over is fully exempt from income tax where his or her total income from all sources is less than the relevant exemption limit. For 2019, the exemption limits are &euro;36,000 for a married couple or civil partners and &euro;18,000 for a single individual. Where an individual exceeds the exemption limit, he or she is liable to tax based on the normal system of rate bands and tax credits, subject to marginal relief where relevant.</p>  <p>  Other tax supports for individuals in this age group include the Age Tax Credit which is available to all individuals aged 65 or over who do not qualify for an exemption from income tax. This credit is currently set at &euro;245 for single individuals or &euro;490 for a married couple or civil partners. </p>  <p>  I would also note that the State Contributory Pension and the State Non-Contributory Pension are not chargeable to Universal Social Charge (USC) or Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI).  </p>  <p>  In the context of limited resources, I am satisfied that the current USC system is fair and equitable to individuals who are over the age of 66. </p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I would advise therefore if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of the child, the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, that these should be raised by her parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school she is attending, with a view to that Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.</p></reply>

My officials also exchanged information with that department relating to the projects seeking funding.  My officials have requested a meeting with the Department of Health in respect of those applications that are proposing new build nursing homes. </p>  <p>  As part of the assessments process my Department interacts with the relevant government departments and agencies regarding various aspects of proposed projects.  </p></reply>

The matter remains before the courts, with the Court of Appeal reserving judgement on the appeal on 8 October, and the matter, therefore, remains sub-judice. We await an outcome from the Court of Appeal which will, of course, have a bearing on whether or not legislative change is required.  Should it be necessary, I intend to introduce a Bill in the Oireachtas as soon as possible this term.</p>  <p>  I know that colleagues of all parties are concerned with the difficulty that has arisen and I am hopeful that, if legislative change is necessary, the Oireachtas will give the Bill early and positive consideration.</p>  <p>  My Department is doing everything possible to develop a legislative solution. At the end of July, I obtained Cabinet approval for a proposed Bill to address the matter and my department continues to work with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office to finalise the draft Bill.  </p>  <p>   As the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of citizenship ceremonies will be very much influenced by both the judgement of the Court of Appeal and the introduction of any necessary legislation. My officials are currently engaged in contingency planning to ensure those most affected by current circumstances are invited to a naturalisation ceremony at the earliest possible opportunity. As soon as the legal issues are resolved, my officials will make all necessary arrangements for the next Citizenship Ceremony. Invitations will issue four weeks in advance of the ceremony to ensure everyone has adequate notice. </p>  <p>  In the interim, my Department is advising those who are planning to apply for citizenship to continue to collect all of the necessary proofs that support their application and to submit a comprehensive application form. Once a solution is in place, if any additional information is required, applicants will be contacted as part of the processing of their application.</p>  <p>  The ruling of the High Court is not considered to have consequences for anyone who has already obtained citizenship under the Act. </p></reply>

The Act comprises 3 Parts in all, with Part 1 pertaining to the short title and commencement of the Act.</p>  <p>  Part 2 of the Act provides for amendments to Acts relating to family law.  The main provision in Part 2 is section 3.  Section 3 amends section 5 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996.  This reduces the minimum living apart period specified in that Act to two years during the previous three years.  Previously the minimum living apart period was four years during the previous five years.</p>  <p>  Part 3 of the Act makes provision for the recognition of divorces, legal separations and marriage annulments granted under the law of the United Kingdom, in the event that the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union without an agreement that applies to this area of law.  I will bring Part 3 into operation only if and when the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union without such an agreement. </p>  <p>  It is my intention to make a commencement order to bring all sections of Parts 1 and 2 of the Family Law Act 2019 into operation on 1 December 2019.  At the heart of the Government&rsquo;s reforms in this area of the law is a desire to ease the burden on people whose marriages have broken down.  This legislation will ensure that the process for obtaining a divorce is fair, dignified and humane. </p></reply>

A visa would normally be placed in a person's passport by an Irish consular official outside the State  to allow that person to travel to Ireland for a stated purpose.  It may be necessary to issue a visa to a potential investor prior to the completion of the investment in order that the person travel to Ireland to complete the legal and other requirements of the investment and to register for permission to reside here.</p>  <p>  However, as of 1 January 2019 my Department introduced new control measures to allow for the verification of the investment prior to the granting of a residence permission.  A successful applicant is now invited to make their investment and on completion of this process and on the provision of evidence of the investment they will be granted a residence permission. An applicant is given 90 days in which to complete their investment. Failure to do so will result in the application being deemed withdrawn.</p>  <p>  Prior to 2019 the applicant was required to provide this evidence when they were registering for their permission to reside. They had to provide a letter from their legal representative confirming the investment was made, a letter from the beneficiary stating that they had received the investment and documentary evidence based on the investment type e.g. a share certificate from the investment fund confirming the investment.</p></reply>

This involved the utilisation of best in class compliance databases including politically exposed person checks. Further control measures were introduced from 1 January 2019 . All applicants must now provide a third party due diligence report from a risk management company. Additionally, all personal documentation must be apostilled or dually legalised in the country of origin before it will be accepted.</p>  <p>  In 2019 a data sharing agreement was signed with the Revenue Commissioners which allows for the sharing of certain applicant information with the Revenue Commissioners for onward sharing with both the OECD and the applicant's country of origin. This measure was adopted to support the OECD&rsquo;s Common Reporting Standard. The data will be shared once an applicant has made their investment in Ireland.</p></reply>

As such, the Director is of the view that it is preferable to allow that process to fully bed down before filling the Corporate Compliance manager vacancy. The Director is further conscious of the fact that the transition of the ODCE to an independent Agency will give rise to additional expertise requirements and, as such, is of the view that it is prudent that those considerations should be factored into developing the role, and associated skill set, required of the appointee.</p></reply>

We continue to monitor Ireland's competitiveness and analyse the factors that are crucial to attracting further investments in the country.</p><p>The World Bank Ease of Doing Business 2019 report compares the &lsquo;ease of doing&rsquo; business in 190 economies using quantitative indicators. The report assesses the impact of 10 areas of business regulation: starting a business; dealing with construction permits; getting electricity; registering property; getting credit; protecting minority investors; paying taxes; trading across borders; enforcing contracts; and, resolving insolvency.</p><p>In the latest report, Ireland is ranked 24<sup>th</sup>globally (and 6<sup>th</sup>in the euro area). While these rankings represent a fall of one place from the previous year, the World Bank report also suggests that Ireland has become a better place to do business in the past 12 months, as Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;doing business&rsquo; score improved. The primary reason Ireland fell one place in these rankings was because other countries improved relatively more than Ireland over the past year.</p><p>However, as competitiveness is a broad term, it is important to look at a range of indicators to ensure we have a holistic view of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. My Department considers a range of competitiveness indicators, including: (i) two other international competitiveness rankings - the IMD Competitiveness Yearbook (where Ireland is ranked 7<sup>th</sup>globally), and the WEF Global Competitiveness Report (24<sup>th</sup>­). My Department also consider hard indicators such as the Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator (HCI) and Nominal Unit Labour Costs, which both suggest that Ireland is becoming more competitive. </p><p>Given Ireland&rsquo;s performance in these, and a wider selection of indicators, my view (one shared by the National Competitiveness Council) is that Ireland remains a competitive economy. </p><p>However, the fall in the World Bank rankings underline the fact that there is no room for complacency. The National Competitiveness Council (NCC) will issue recommendations on the actions needed to improve competitiveness in its forthcoming Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge 2019 report before the end of the year.  These recommendations will be brought to the attention of Government and responded to in due course. </p></reply>

Companies headquartered in the United States of America account for 766 of these firms. While North America remains the principal source of FDI into the country, the IDA continues to diversify its portfolio of investors here. In 2018 alone, for example, 24 investments were secured from growth markets, representing an increase of 14% on 2017. </p>  <p>  I am particularly encouraged by the progress made by IDA Ireland in attracting first-time investors from Asian markets. Last year, for example, saw notable investments from Chinese, Indian and South Korean firms. This shows that the concerted effort that the IDA has made to target Asian investors is now producing results in terms of new jobs here on the ground in Ireland. Last month, I led a Trade and Investment Mission to Japan with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland where I attended a series of engagements with industry leaders and met with Japan's Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry. This trade mission highlighted the important work of the IDA and our enterprise agencies in deepening and broadening out trade and investment links to the Asia-Pacific region and other new markets.  </p>  <p>  While much has been accomplished in this context, the Government remains conscious of our need to continue attracting FDI from as many different countries as possible. To diversify investment here further, we need to build awareness of Ireland as a preferred investment destination in target countries, as well as improve competitiveness and consolidate Ireland&rsquo;s traditional strengths in terms of talent, productivity and ease of doing business. I am confident that this approach will help boost further the number of investors here from non-traditional markets and that we will continue to see greater geographic diversity across the IDA's client portfolio. The Agency's efforts in this context are already being reinforced and supported by the Global Ireland strategy, which will build and deepen Ireland's footprint all over the world in the period up to 2025.</p>  <p>  While we will continue to focus on strengthening FDI from growth markets, we must also not neglect the importance of our traditional source markets. Ireland's strong track record with companies from those markets - which employ tens of thousands of people across the country - has been hard-won and is the product of decades of hard work. That is why the IDA will continue to do everything possible to sustain and grow investment levels from North America and Europe while also seeking to increase investment from growth markets. </p></reply>

That is why my Department has been engaging with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) since late 2017 towards the completion of a comprehensive Review of SME and Entrepreneurship Policy in Ireland.  </p><p>I was delighted to launch the Review of SME and Entrepreneurship issues and policies in Ireland with the Secretary General of the OECD &Aacute;ngel Gurr&iacute;a on 8 March 2018. </p><p>This has been a concentrated and collaborate 18-month project with my Department having played a central role supporting and facilitating the OECD during this process. The focus of the review provides tailored analysis and recommendations to DBEI and the Irish government on how to improve the design and implementation of national SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes, based on an assessment of the country&rsquo;s current SME and entrepreneurship performance, framework conditions and policies based on international comparisons.  </p><p>Areas covered include taxation, the regulatory environment, productivity challenges, skills and regional development. It also includes an assessment of the main SME-targeted programme areas, including SME workforce skills, standards adoption, internationalisation, financing and innovation.  </p><p>My officials have organised and officiated at stakeholder events throughout the process to facilitate detailed engagement between my Department, other Government Departments, agencies, academia, business representatives and small businesses themselves. This engagement has enabled the OECD to gain insightful understandings from stakeholders in Ireland and to develop an independent assessment of the Irish SME and entrepreneurship ecosystem at the various critical stages of the review. The OECD review draws together a wealth of expertise and analysis from across the key policy Directorates of the OECD, together with the OECD's independent assessments of Ireland's key programmes and schemes and supports for SMEs and entrepreneurs. The extent of the international good practice identified by the OECD will also provide valuable inputs to my consideration of further changes and improvements to our policy mix and supports in Ireland.</p><p>Testament to the culmination of the 18 month&rsquo;s intensive engagement between my Department officials and the OECD secretariat, I welcomed the OECD Deputy Secretary General Knudsen to Dublin last week, where, together we launched the Review and the accompanying SME Strategy Roadmap on Thursday 31<sup>st</sup>October.</p><p>The task at hand now through my Department, is to ensure the development of a SME Strategy which will inform Government&rsquo;s Future Jobs Initiative on how best to support and foster our indigenous ecosystem into the future. </p><p>The total cost associated with commissioning the OECD to carry out the review was &euro;300,000, made in three separate instalments over the 18-month period: <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Date</th>       <th>Amount</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1st   Instalment</td>       <td>1st June 2018</td>       <td>&euro;85,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2nd   Instalment</td>       <td>21st December 2018</td>       <td>&euro;115,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>3rd   Instalment</td>       <td>5th June 2019</td>       <td>&euro;100,000</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>Total</td>       <td>&euro;300,000</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

I, as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation have no direct function in such matters.</p><p>I am informed that figures for cases investigated, by year received, and convictions in the years 2017, 2018 and to date in 2019 are as set out in tabular form below: <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2017 </th>       <th>2018 </th>       <th>2019 (as of 4 November)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cases investigated received in year</td>       <td>467 </td>       <td>504 </td>       <td>355 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Convictions (by DPP)</td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>2 </td>       <td>1, plus 1 dismissed (under the Probation Act)</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The number of investigations per se does not represent the totality of the work of the ODCE; firstly because of the volume of liquidation cases and secondly because not all investigations result in a prosecution.  As will be seen from the ODCE&rsquo;s Annual Reports, complaints are not always relevant to the remit of the Office; where they are within the remit the matter is investigated.  It should be noted that not all investigations are of a criminal nature and the ODCE policy is to seek rectification of breaches in the first instance (where the matter is appropriate for such action).</p><p>The ODCE also exercised its right to make certain compliance applications to the High Court under Section 371 of the Companies Act 1963, now Section 797 of the Companies Act 2014, to secure compliance with Orders sought. </p><p>However, it should be borne in mind that, working within the context of a rectification policy, many issues can be addressed by exercise of powers without the necessity of bringing issues to the Courts for determination, for example: production of registers; directing the holding of Annual General Meetings; production of minutes of meetings; and regularising breaches of the director loan provisions which, in 2018, secured the rectification on a non-statutory basis, of suspected infringements of the Companies Act 2014, in relation to Directors&rsquo; loans in 18 cases, to an aggregate value of &euro;6.1m approximately.</p><p>The ODCE took a decision in recent years to concentrate its resources on more serious and complex investigations, the result of which is usually the submission of a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for consideration, as opposed to a summary prosecution.  It is important to appreciate that the purpose of a criminal investigation is not to secure a conviction. Rather, the purpose is to establish the facts. Thereafter, it is a matter for the DPP to determine, having regard to the facts and to potentially relevant offences, whether the direction of charges is appropriate and in the public interest.</p><p>In terms of prosecutions, the Director of Corporate Enforcement is only statutorily empowered to initiate summary prosecutions (i.e. prosecutions of relatively minor offences in the District Court). </p><p>More serious alleged breaches of company law are prosecuted on indictment in the Circuit Court and only the Director of Public Prosecutions (&ldquo;DPP&rdquo;) can direct that charges be preferred on indictment.</p></reply>

These can be broken down as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>No. of Units Detained </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>555,406 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>507,889</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>413,289</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 (January &ndash; August)</td>       <td>363,820</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Online supply of prescription medicines into or within Ireland is illegal. The HPRA is aware of many illegal websites that purport to be pharmacies and offer to supply a range of prescription medicines direct to the public. Medicines bought from these sites may be falsified. They may contain no active ingredient, too much or too little of an active ingredient, or the wrong ingredients altogether. There is no way to be certain how or where the medicine was made, the quality of the active ingredient(s) or fillers (inert ingredients) used and the medicine may not have been packaged, labelled or stored correctly and could be out of date. </p><p>The HPRA continually and strongly recommends patients do not seek to purchase prescription medicines that have not been prescribed by a registered medical practitioner and dispensed by a registered pharmacy as there can be no guarantee as to their safety, quality or efficacy, in addition to the health risks for persons seeking to self-medicate. As Minister for Health, I strongly urge patients to follow this recommendation.</p><p>The HPRA continues to work with Revenue&rsquo;s Customs Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to monitor and investigate instances of illegal supply of medicines, through retail sales in Ireland and via online sources, and actively enforces against suspected breaches of the law. </p><p>For further information, consumers are urged to access the HPRA leaflet &lsquo;Dangers of Buying Prescription Medicines Online&rsquo;, which is available on its website at www.hpra.ie and to report concerns to reportacase@hpra.ie</p></reply>

As part of its recommendations in this area, the Committee called for the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused &lsquo;national centre&rsquo; carrying out national level functions, and the establishment of regional bodies with responsibility for the planning and delivery of integrated care at a regional level. </p>  <p>  I intend to return to Government next year with detailed proposals regarding the roles and responsibilities of the new regional areas.  This will also detail the consequently revised role and function of the HSE &lsquo;national centre&rsquo;, which will determine any impact on management and administration requirements, both at central and regional level. These proposals will also outline a timeline for the establishment of regional organisations and any legislative changes required to realise the Sl&aacute;intecare vision. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department will work closely with the HSE to continue to improve management and accountability of the health system. At the same time, there will be continued engagement with all key stakeholders to ensure that the reform process does not cause disruption to services and accountability. </p>  <p>  Finally, I want to make clear that the proposed changes to health structures are only one element among many of the broader reform plans arising from the Sl&aacute;intecare report. These proposals must be seen as part of the broader proposals in the 2019 Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan to support and develop a better health and social care service based on clinical and service integration, enhanced service capacity and delivery and improved governance, accountability and patient safety arrangements.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act and the National Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines with industry, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE, it must submit an application to the HSE to have the medicine added to the reimbursement list. Reimbursement is considered for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, including on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).</p>  <p>  In August 2018, the NCPE recommended a full health technology assessment (HTA) for erenumab (Aimovig), indicated for the treatment of chronic and episodic migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month when initiating treatment with erenumab.</p>  <p>  On 30 September 2019, the NCPE completed its review and gave the following recommendations for erenumab:</p>  <p>  - For chronic migraine, the NCPE recommended that erenumab be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness can be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  - For episodic migraine, the NCPE recommended that erenumab not be considered for reimbursement.</p>  <p>  The final decision will take into consideration the NCPE's recommendation and the statutory criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  In April 2019, the NCPE recommended a full HTA for fremanezumab (Ajovy), indicated for prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least four migraine days per month. On 26 September 2019, the NCPE received a submission from the manufacturer and its assessment is ongoing.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to add the medicine to the reimbursement list, agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p></reply>

The couple involved have requested a review of their case.  </p>  <p>  My overriding concern as Minister for Health is for the couple involved and ensuring that questions regarding this incident are appropriately answered. As such, I support an independent and external review into this case. I have been advised that the National Maternity Hospital has commissioned such a review. I am sure that the Deputy would agree it is important to await the outcome of that review process, which will allow for a better understanding of what has occurred. It will also allow for any learning that may emerge to be disseminated throughout the health system. I can assure the Deputy and the House that any recommendations made by the review panel will be actioned by my Department, as well as the HSE in order to ensure that a similar incident does not occur again. My Department has also sought assurances from the National Maternity Hospital with regard to the safety and operation of the termination service, and it in turn has confirmed its compliance with the relevant legislation. </p>  <p>  I have also met with the family to hear directly of their experiences. A note of that meeting was provided directly to the couple on 23 October last by email. My officials are currently working on a response with regard to the other two notes which the Deputy has referred to.</p></reply>

These actions include developing the charging network to stay sufficiently ahead of demand. </p>  <p>  There are currently over 650 standard public charge points and 96 fast chargers (the majority of which are operated by the ESB) in Ireland. A real-time map showing the ESB charge point locations, including the status and availability of these charge points, is available on the ESB's website at www.esb.ie/ecars.</p>  <p>  Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, I approved funding of up to &euro;10 million which will support the ESB to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network, with the ESB also investing &euro;10 million. This project includes the installation of 140 fast chargers consisting of 90 150kW chargers (each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously) and upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to 50kW chargers The project will also involve replacing over 500 existing standard charge points with next generation high reliability models. </p>  <p>  This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022. The locations of the chargers that will be installed as part of this project have not been finalised. However, a provisional map of the planned network, showing indicative locations, was developed by the ESB and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided &euro;36 million in funding to my Department to support the uptake of electric vehicles and supporting charging infrastructure. In August, I announced funding to support the rollout of on-street public charge points for electric vehicles. A total of &euro;2 million has been provided in Budget 2020 to support the installation of up to 400 on-street chargers in 2020.

The State&rsquo;s early allocation of the 3.6Ghz spectrum in 2017, (the first in Europe) and the actions to remove commercial barriers to 5G rollouts, undertaken through the Government&rsquo;s Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce are both key enablers to ensuring 5G becomes a reality in Ireland at the earliest opportunity. The recent announcements by a number of commercial operators to launch 5G services is therefore a welcome development.</p><p>The future connectivity needs of citizens will be met by a combination of solutions, that will include 5G along with a range of complementary services including 4G and 3G, together with fixed high speed broadband services, such as those that will be provided under National Broadband Plan. ComReg's report on Meeting Consumers' Connectivity Needs () highlights this point. </p></reply>

The Guidelines require, amongst other things, that Member States carry out a detailed mapping exercise to identify as far as reasonably possible those areas where intervention is required.</p>  <p>  Since July 2013, the Department has engaged in an extensive process of mapping broadband availability in Ireland in order to identify premises requiring State intervention. The mapping exercise has been supported by a number of public consultations which have elicited significant response from industry and the public. The most significant changes to the NBP Map took place in 2017. The Department added a further 84,500 premises to the Intervention Area where commercial investment plans previously provided to the Department had failed to materialise. The update also removed 300,000 premises from the intervention area on the basis of what was then a planned infrastructure build, that eir entered into a Commitment Agreement in respect of. An updated NBP Map was then published in April 2017 encompassing 540,000 premises in the intervention area for the purposes of the NBP procurement. </p>  <p>  A further consultation on the NBP Map was held in January 2018. Responses from industry were limited and the NBP Map remained unchanged for the purposes of Final Tender in September 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department recently conducted a public consultation to close the ongoing mapping exercise, seeking submissions from operators who wish to have their existing high speed broadband networks, or who have developed plans to invest in high speed broadband networks over the next 7 years, to be included on the Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map. That consultation was extended twice at the request of operators, resulting in a total nine week period for submissions and it closed on 30th September 2019. </p>  <p>  As part of the consultation, over 180 submissions were received from a variety of stakeholders, including 30 from large and small commercial telecommunications operators, with the remainder from local authority broadband officers and members of the public.</p>  <p>  Operator submissions are assessed against the Department&rsquo;s published assessment criteria. Operators submitting planned investments are required to sign a declaration that they will enter into a Commitment Agreement with the Department if their plans satisfy the assessment criteria and are accepted by the Department as being concrete and credible.</p>  <p>  The findings of the consultation, which will be available in the coming weeks, will ensure that the State Intervention Area is up to date and that it reflects commercial operators&rsquo; plans and the responses from householders and businesses, in advance of a contract being signed later this year. This will be an important element in concluding the State Aid approval process with the European Commission.</p></reply>

Member States cannot exceed the testing intervals for different categories of vehicles laid down by the Directive.</p>  <p>  The testing intervals for commercial vehicles registered in Ireland are set by Regulation 6 of the Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness (Vehicle Testing) (No. 2) Regulations 2013 (as amended).  The Vehicle Testing Regulations transpose into Irish law, many of the obligations set by Directive 2014/45/EU.</p>  <p>  The roadworthiness standards for a vehicle can deteriorate when it is declared off the road as not only can the vehicle continue to be used on private property, some components such as tyres will degrade naturally over time.  For these reasons it is not anticipated that vehicles that are declared off the road will have their due dates for periodic roadworthiness testing extended in any way.</p></reply>

Concerns with regard to aviation safety, arising from the two tragic accidents involving Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines, has resulted in the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. It is of paramount importance that any and all aviation safety concerns are addressed, and time must be permitted for this very important work to be completed. This is a matter for the Aviation Safety Authorities worldwide, including the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) in the United States and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), of which Ireland is a Member. </p>  <p>  My Department and the IAA are actively monitoring the ongoing work by Boeing, the FAA and EASA and the aircraft will only be returned to service when all safety concerns have been comprehensively addressed and resolved.</p></reply>

The video referred to by the Deputy is the first in that series. </p>  <p>  The videos were funded directly by my Department at a cost of &euro;26,610 with a further &euro;5,000 allocated (&euro;500 per video) for online promotion.

These include key decisions in relation to the target membership, the contribution rates, the policies in relation to opting-out and re-enrolment, the administrative arrangements and organisational approach and the investment options.  </p>  <p>  As stated in the 'The Roadmap for Pensions Reform', the Government proposes to begin implementation of a supplementary retirement savings system, known as Automatic Enrolment (AE), by 2022.  AE will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  The saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out. </p>  <p>  In relation to an early drawdown option for a mortgage deposit, while such an approach may appear reasonable and improve the attractiveness of AE for some people, the core policy objective of AE is to ensure adequate retirement savings.  Therefore, facilitating early access to pension savings could potentially compromise overall retirement adequacy.  In this regard, it is worth bearing in mind that early access to pension funds for house deposits or for other similar reasons is not currently possible for those with existing supplementary pensions in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Given that allowing people to access their pensions early is contrary to achieving the policy goal of pension adequacy, the Government has decided that a limited number of &lsquo;Savings Suspension periods&rsquo; will be facilitated in the AE system for members who wish to temporarily cease making contributions. These savings suspension periods could be used when a person wishes to save for a house deposit, for instance.   In such cases, employer and State contributions will also cease.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  </p></reply>

These include key decisions in relation to the target membership, the contribution rates, the policies in relation to opting-out and re-enrolment, the administrative arrangements and organisational approach and the investment options.  </p>  <p>  As stated in the 'The Roadmap for Pensions Reform', the Government proposes to begin implementation of a supplementary retirement savings system, known as Automatic Enrolment (AE), by 2022.  AE will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  The saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out. </p>  <p>  There are five main areas where work is on-going so as to produce design options for Government to consider.  These areas relate to: the scope and role of the Central Processing Authority;  the design of the State financial incentive; the nature and functions of the Registered Providers; the investment framework and funds to be offered by Registered Providers, including the design of the default fund, and also the pay-out phase; and the phasing of implementation.</p>  <p>  In relation to the operational arrangements of the CPA, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was successful in obtaining technical support from the EU-Structural Reform Support Service (EU-SRSS).  This European Commission service provides targeted support to member states implementing administrative and institutional reforms.  In this regard, my officials are being assisted by the EU-SRSS in developing proposals on the design, scope, governance, and financing costs of the CPA, which will be prepared for Government before the end of the year.  Thereafter, once the CPA design is selected and approved by Government, legislation will have to be drafted and enacted.  The intention is that work on the legislation will commence in 2020.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of a State financial incentive, while the issue of tax incentives within wider supplementary pensions is under the remit of the Department of Finance, the issue of financial incentives for private pensions formed part of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Groups (IDPRTG) Consultation on Supplementary Pensions Reform.  On the basis of the findings from this review, the responses to the Strawman consultation, and ongoing research and consultation with experts from around the world, a set of options on the design of a State incentive for AE will be brought to Government in the first quarter 2020.</p>  <p>  In relation to the nature and functions of the Registered Providers, the wider investment framework for AE and the pay-out phase, a set of proposals on these will also be submitted to Government for its consideration in the first quarter of 2020. </p>  <p>  In terms of the resources allocated to achieve this commitment, a full time &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment Programme Management Office&rsquo; (PMO) has been established within my Department.  In addition, an Inter-departmental &lsquo;Automatic Enrolment Programme Board&rsquo; has been set up to provide the strategic direction for the development of the AE system. Furthermore, as the AE system is implemented, additional resources will be put in place as and when required and appropriate. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputies.    </p></reply>

It is estimated that just 35% of private sector workers have supplementary pension coverage through either occupational or private pension schemes.  This can lead to these workers being reliant solely on the State Pension in retirement, which may result in a significant and unwanted reduction in their living standards.</p>  <p>  In order to address this challenge, the Government has committed to begin implementation of a supplementary retirement savings system, known as Automatic Enrolment (AE), by 2022.  AE will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  The saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out.  Moreover, the AE system is being designed to complement existing private pension provision, and in no way conflicts with the current private pension landscape. </p>  <p>  Key decisions have now been made in relation to the target membership, the contribution rates, the policies in relation to opting-out and re-enrolment, the administrative arrangements and organisational approach and the investment options.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the target membership, employees aged between 23 and 60, who earn more than &euro;20,000 a year (across all employments) and are not already contributing to a workplace pension, will be automatically enrolled.  Employees who are existing members of a pension scheme/contract that meets prescribed minimum standards and contribution levels will not be automatically enrolled for the employment to which that pension relates. </p>  <p>  The introduction of AE will help to ensure that workers in the private sector are enrolled in quality assured pension schemes which, by supplementing the State Pension, will provide an adequate income in retirement.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputies. </p></reply>

AE will see a transition from the current and purely voluntary system to one which will, subject to certain parameters, automatically enrol employees into a quality assured retirement savings system.  The saver will maintain the freedom of choice to opt-out. </p>  <p>  There are five main areas where work is on-going so as to produce design options for Government to consider.  These areas relate to the design of: the State financial incentive; the scope and role of the Central Processing Authority; the nature and functions of the Registered Providers; the investment framework and funds to be offered by Registered Providers, including the design of the default fund, and also the pay-out phase; and the phasing of implementation.</p>  <p>  With respect to a State financial incentive, the Strawman proposal gave the illustrative example that the State could contribute &euro;1 for every &euro;3 contributed by the individual to their pension fund.  However, the level of the State incentive and its interaction with the existing marginal rate of tax relief scheme for occupational pensions was one of the issues that generated much debate in the consultation process. </p>  <p>  While the issue of State incentives within wider supplementary pensions is under the remit of the Department of Finance, it formed part of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Groups (IDPRTG) Consultation on Supplementary Pensions Reform.  On the basis of the findings from this review, the responses to the Strawman consultation, and ongoing research and consultation with experts around the world, a set of options on the design of a financial incentive for AE will be brought to Government in the first quarter of 2020.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Irish Water&rsquo;s engineering team are currently assessing the plant in detail to determine the actions necessary to return the plant to full production and to ensure that the plant is resilient into the future.</p><p>The turbidity issues now arising are linked to the need to upgrade the older part of this treatment plant to improve the performance of the plant. In particular, the EPA has identified in its audits that the filters at the plant need to be upgraded.</p><p>It is a matter for the EPA and the HSE as regulators &ndash; and for Irish Water as the water utility, working with the local authority, to ensure that national standards are complied with.  </p><p>I have spoken to the Managing Director of Irish Water and the CEO of Fingal County Council and will be meeting with them to discuss the issues in detail.

Local authorities are also working hard to bring homes back into use by acquiring dwellings in unfinished estates, liaising with financial institutions on their vacant property portfolios and utilising CPO powers to acquire empty properties. These recovered properties aid us in the ongoing effort to meeting our commitments under Pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland, which sets out a range of measures to assist in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s housing needs by ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s existing housing stock is used to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  My Department has also made legislative amendments in support of the reactivation of the optimum number of vacant residential properties. New exempted development Regulations which came into operation in early 2018, allow for the change of use, and any related works, of certain vacant commercial premises to residential use without the need to obtain planning permission. We also introduced Regulations late last year to provide clarity on the application of Disability Access Certificates to existing buildings when brought back into reuse.</p>  <p>  Having regard to potentially vacant space above retail space, my Department has recently launched the Bringing Back Homes &ndash; Manual for the reuse of existing buildings, to help property owners, the public, local authorities and the construction industry to developing vacant buildings and space over commercial property. Bringing Back Homes aims to help increase housing supply as well as rejuvenate town centres and city streets. Publication of the manual was a commitment under Action 5.21 of Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness and is also referenced in the National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy.   Amongst other things, the manual provides a suite of reuse options for  common building types and elaborates on the complexity associated with each option giving an overview of the technical requirements associated with creating &lsquo;over the shop&rsquo; space into residential units.</p>  <p>  In order to more accurately determine the levels of long-term, vacant but recoverable dwellings that can be re-introduced into the liveable housing stock, the Department, in conjunction with the Housing Agency, the CSO and the local government sector, developed a survey methodology in relation to locating vacant housing and a pilot field-based survey was undertaken across six local authorities (Cork City Council, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, Limerick City and County Council, Mayo County Council, Meath County Council, Waterford City and County Council.)</p>  <p>  Each participating local authority visually inspected  approximately 1,200 homes each, recording the location of potentially vacant properties, and where possible, recording apparent reasons for vacancy and categorising each vacant home (with a view to prioritising those which are seen as most likely to be re-introduced into the liveable housing stock). To identify long-term vacancy, the pilot requires two visual inspections, six months apart, with those houses occupied between the two inspections disregarded. </p>  <p>  The participating local authorities have completed their work on the pilot vacancy identification survey and my Department are analysing the results of the pilot survey and is currently considering the outcomes to determine whether there would be significant value in rolling out the survey on a national basis. </p>  <p>While neither Cavan County Council nor Monaghan County Council were involved in the pilot vacancy survey, both have requested access to the GIS application that was used during the pilot, which will allow them visually inspect and log potentially long-term vacant properties in their administrative area, which could be re-introduced into the liveable housing stock.   </p></reply>

Detailed examination of the Bill, undertaken in consultation with the Attorney General, has highlighted a number of unacceptable risks which I have shared with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government (the Committee).   The Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser has separately advised the Committee in relation to the Bill.</p>  <p>  My response has been to seek to bring forward appropriate amendments to the Bill.  In November 2018, I received Government approval for the priority drafting of proposed amendments which will focus on retaining the entity charged with the provision of public water services in public ownership. </p>  <p>  Good progress on a revised wording proposal continues to be made by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in conjunction with my Department. On 15 July 2019 I advised the Committee that I am working towards concluding a revised wording proposal. I will write to the Committee again shortly to update it on this matter.  </p></reply>

Dublin and issued a letter of support in this regard in January of 2016.</p>  <p>  The sites in question are at the location of previously existing, now defunct, commonage gates. Such systems were designed in an Ireland where there was very little traffic so the presence of a gate across a road was not a big issue.

Clearly, a licence to capture hares is not required for Open coursing events where hares are not captured and as such there is no requirement for all such events to be listed on the  schedule to the licence issued to the Irish Coursing Club. </p><p>In its opening statement delivered to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 9 July 2019, the ICC made a distinction between Affiliated Clubs and Associated Clubs.

In particular, the 2011 Regulations transpose two key pieces of EU nature legislation: the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. </p><p>The main aim of the Habitats Directive is to contribute towards the conservation of biodiversity by requiring Member States to take measures to maintain or restore natural habitats and wild species listed on the Annexes to the Directive at a favourable conservation status. These annexes list habitats (Annex I) and species (Annexes II, IV and V) which are considered threatened in the EU territory. The listed habitats and species represent a considerable proportion of biodiversity in Ireland and the Directive itself is one of the most important pieces of legislation governing the conservation of biodiversity in Europe.</p><p>Under Article 11 of the Directive, Ireland is obliged to undertake surveillance of the conservation status of the natural habitats and species in the Annexes and, under Article 17, to report to the European Commission every six years on their status and on the implementation of the measures taken under the Directive.</p><p>In April 2019, Ireland submitted the third assessment of conservation status for 59 habitats and 60 species (including three overview assessments of species at a group level). A further 8 species are considered to be vagrant in Ireland.</p><p>The Article 17 report for 2019 is published in 3 volumes: An overview report (Volume 1), released in August 2019, provides more detail on the methodologies, an easy-to-read summary of the results and a list of contributors to the assessments. Volume 2 (Habitats) and Volume 3 (Species) contain the detailed reports and relevant scientific information. The report is available on the NPWS website (</p><p>While many habitats are still considered to be in unfavourable status, the picture for plant and animal species is substantially better, with over 70% reported as stable or increasing. </p><p>Article 12.1 of the Birds Directive states that &ldquo;Member States shall forward to the Commission every three years, starting from 7 April 1981, a report on the implementation of national provisions taken under this Directive.&rdquo; In 2008 a new system of bird reporting was developed similar to the reporting format under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive. This also included a transition from a three-year to six-year reporting cycle, synchronised with the reporting under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive. The first report under the revised format covered the period 2008 &ndash; 2012 and reported out on Ireland&rsquo;s regularly occurring breeding species as well as those wintering and passage species that trigger SPA classification.</p><p>As part of this reporting obligation Ireland submitted, on schedule, 209 season specific assessments, including assessments for all of Ireland&rsquo;s regularly occurring breeding species and a large proportion of those species&rsquo; populations that occur here during the non-breeding period, to the European Topic Centre on October 31<sup>st</sup>2019. Additionally a general report was also transmitted. The 209 &lsquo;species-seasons&rsquo; figure can be broken down into:</p><p>- 142 assessments of breeding birds (including a short report on one species, Corn Bunting, that went extinct after the Birds Directive came into force);</p><p>- 63 wintering accounts with the vast majority related to wintering waterbird populations; and</p><p>- four accounts of birds using Ireland&rsquo;s coastlines or her offshore waters on passage (i.e. three tern species and one shearwater).</p><p>Approximately 30% of the breeding species assessed are estimated to have remained stable or increased in abundance over the long-term. This cohort includes those relatively recent colonists with strong population growth including Little Egret, Great Skua, Mediterranean Gull, Little Ringed Plover, Bearded Tit and Great Spotted Woodpecker as well as our re-introduced raptor species of Golden Eagle, White-tailed Eagle and Red Kite (along with other raptor species Buzzard and Peregrine). These recent additions to Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird community need to be viewed in the context that almost 20% of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding bird species, and where available data allows, are considered to be in long term decline. </p><p>The majority of Ireland&rsquo;s breeding seabird species&rsquo; long term population trends are now reckoned to be either stable or increasing and this follows through to quite consistent population increases within the breeding seabird group (where the available data allows) over the short-term period as well. Gannet continues to increase in abundance and breeding range with a relatively new colony established on Lambay Island off the east coast. In relation to the recorded short term population increases and with regard to the many short term breeding distribution increases it is possible that the increased level of breeding seabird survey effort over the last four years or so may be partially responsible for some of these recorded gains.  </p><p>Of particular note are the very strong population increases with several of our breeding tern species (e.g. Roseate Tern, Sandwich Tern, Little Tern and Common Tern). At the site level it is evident that targeted conservation measures in the form of wardened tern colonies is resulting in direct and effective conservation positives.  However several of these particular species&rsquo; estimated long-term breeding range trends are in decline or stagnant which not only reinforces the need for such conservation management interventions but also clearly sets out the on-going obligation that such conservation initiatives are maintained or where necessary (especially with regard to the management of predators) improved. </p><p>Robust and contemporary population estimates have been produced for approximately 85% of our breeding seabird species. Work is on-going in my Department with surveys of burrow nesting seabirds (e.g. Puffin, Manx Shearwater, Storm Petrel and Leach&rsquo;s Storm Petrel) located on offshore marine islands.  </p><p>Due to a lack of available data we have not provided contemporary population estimates for several species, some of which trigger SPA classifications (e.g. Chough, Kingfisher) and others that we have reported in the previous Article 12 round as having undergone significant long-term declines (e.g. Red Grouse, Woodcock with both of these species on Ireland&rsquo;s Open Seasons Order). Plans to increase the monitoring effort for these species are to be prioritised over the coming years.</p><p>Some of our breeding farmland songbirds have been flagged in recent decades as being particularly vulnerable to the modernisation and intensification of agricultural practices. This ongoing change in agricultural practices has led to the extinction of Corn Bunting as a breeding bird in Ireland and has caused significant long term declines to species such as Yellowhammer, Whinchat and Twite for example. The latter two species&rsquo; estimated populations are now considered to be both less than 100 pairs. </p><p>Countryside Bird Survey data for two ground nesting songbird species which are still relatively abundant and widespread, namely Meadow Pipit and Skylark were used for this reporting round. Their preferred breeding habitats include peatlands and unimproved grasslands, and both populations are in decline with the estimated short term abundance of Meadow Pipit declining by over 12% and for Skylark by almost 11%. Over the last 40 years or so the estimated breeding range of the latter has decreased by almost one quarter. Such estimated declines are of particular concern as both Meadow Pipit and Skylark make up significant proportions of the prey base of some of Ireland&rsquo;s raptors of conservation concern including Merlin, Kestrel and Hen Harrier. The estimated short term declines for the latter two raptors are estimated to be circa 28% and 10% respectively. </p><p>Breeding waders as a group continue to suffer significant declines in both population and breeding range, in both the short- and long-term. Species such as Curlew, Lapwing, Redshank and Dunlin have declined by 93% or more in the long term. Certain breeding duck populations are also of concern with numbers of breeding Common Scoter continuing to decline to critically low levels. While this species&rsquo; range is stable, the population has declined 21-54% in the short-term and 61% in the long-term. The latest assessment of breeding Red-breasted Merganser (which was reproduced from the 2008-2012 reporting period due to a lack of contemporary data) estimates that this breeding population has declined 62% in the short-term.</p><p>The vast majority of those wintering populations assessed as part of the Article 12 Reporting process relate to wintering waterbirds. This group includes ducks, geese, swans and waders among others. Due to its geographical location, climate and wetland habitats, Ireland is an important host for hundreds of thousands of visiting waterbirds during the non-breeding/wintering seasons. Due to the relative sizes of their respective biogeographic populations, Ireland is of international importance for several waterbird species including Whooper Swan, Greenland White-fronted Goose, Brent Goose, and Black-tailed Godwit among others. The Article 12 reporting process does not seek information on the wintering range of these species. </p><p>Other birds that are not water-birds visit Ireland during the winter but good data to describe them precisely is not currently available.</p><p>More detailed data, with regard to the numbers of winter migrant water-birds, is available in the recent Irish Wildlife Manual number 106 published by my Department's NPWS:  .</p><p>Information concerning Ireland's Article 12 report can be found at the NPWS website:  </p><p>In addition, NPWS and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency are working together with national experts and with the National Biological Data Centres North and South to produce regional Red Lists for the island of Ireland. The production of Red Lists is an action under our National Biodiversity Plans. Red Lists are published on an irregular basis, as datasets and the necessary national expertise for taxonomic groups become available. </p><p>The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) developed the  standard Red List approach for dealing with the presentation of information on rare and threatened species. IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria were developed in the early nineties to further objectively assess and prioritise species for conservation purposes at a global scale. </p><p>Ireland's Red Lists are available on the NPWS website:  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-11-06a.574.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019110600067#WRP00700"><p>Total funding for the arts and culture sector in 2020 will increase by over 2% from &euro;189m to almost &euro;193m.  </p><p>Primary support for the Arts is delivered through the Arts Council. Funding for the Arts Council has increased in recent years and will reach &euro;80 million in 2020.  This is an increase of &euro;5m or 6.7% over 2019.  The Arts Council, which is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003, operates within a published 10 year strategic framework entitled Making Great Art Work. This strategy prioritises support for artists throughout their careers, by the involvement of many agencies in cultural provision, by the impact of the arts on the creative economy, and by the depth and breadth of people's engagement with the arts.</p><p>The cumulative impact of these funding increases is further testament to the commitment to double Government spending in the sector.  In this context, I am already delivering additional supports to the arts and culture sector, building on the &euro;1.2 billion earmarked for culture, heritage and the Irish language under Project Ireland 2040, thus leading to increased activity and employment across all sectors under the remit of my Department.  </p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme is a five-year all-of-government, culture-based initiative, led by my Department, that emphasises the importance of human creativity for individual, community and societal wellbeing.  The vision of the Creative Ireland Programme is to position creativity at the heart of public policy, to enable, encourage and enhance collaboration and innovation, and to create opportunities for all citizens to engage with all forms of creative activity.  </p><p>In encouraging new ways and means to explore, express and engage with our natural creativity, the Creative Ireland Programme aims to give autonomy to partners (such as local authorities, community groups and schools) to decide on the creative activities that speak to their strengths, preferences and local traditions.</p><p>Under Pillars 1 and 2 of the Programme, a range of creative activities and pursuits are supported - whether that be in what can be considered traditional artforms (such as drama, music of the visual arts), through embracing new and innovate forms of creativity (such as coding) or through new ways to engage with and explore our traditional and heritage craft activities.</p><p>The main source of funding for local community events and activities under the Creative Ireland Programme is Pillar 2 - 'Enabling Creativity in Every Community'.In 2019, total funding of &euro;3m has been allocated to all local authorities to enable them to support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in each county.  Each local authority has established a Creative Ireland Co-ordinator and a local Culture Team to manage and allocate this funding in accordance with local needs and in line with their own, individual 5-year Culture and Creativity Strategy. The projects funded cover a broad range of topics including archaeology, architecture, biodiversity, crafts, heritage, drama, dance, literature, music, storytelling and the visual arts. </p><p>In addition to this core funding, the Creative Ireland Programme has also allocated &euro;15,000 to each local authority outside of Dublin and &euro;75,000 each to the four local authorities in Dublin to develop a special programme of events for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g &ndash; the national day of creativity for children and young people.  Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g took place on 15th June 2019 and included a range of arts based activities for all ages.  Already this year, nearly 1,400 projects have been supported by the Creative Ireland Programme.</p><p>In July of this year, I announced the completion of a review of the Percent for Art scheme.  The outcome of this review led to changes to the scheme&rsquo;s bands and limits which will make significantly increased funding available to the creative community.  The new limits and bands will apply from 1st January 2020 and details may be seen on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>I will shortly be re-establishing an inter-agency group to improve information gathering and collation and sharing of best practice on Percent for Art schemes.  This group will also link in with the Arts Council and seek to enhance the Council&rsquo;s existing advisory role in relation to the Scheme. </p><p>I have recently announced a new &euro;4.7m capital investment scheme for arts and culture centres across the country.  Applications are now being invited for the Cultural Capital Scheme which will focus on enhancing the existing stock of arts and culture centres that operate as not-for-profit organisations.  This new scheme places an emphasis on the reduction of carbon footprints to dovetail with the Government&rsquo;s action on climate change.  Projects providing additional capacity for artists and artistic production particularly in arts centres will also be favoured. The Scheme builds on the success of the Arts and Culture Capital Scheme 2016-2018 which saw grants allocated to 134 organisations in 26 counties to refurbish and enhance their facilities.  This funding is provided from a &euro;40m capital investment allocation for local arts and culture infrastructure contained in Project Ireland 2040 &ldquo;Investing in our Culture, Language &amp;amp; Heritage 2018-2027'.  </p><p>This scheme has been informed by the recently published strategic by  the Arts Council &amp;amp; the County and City Management Association (CCMA)  as well as the Arts Council's published  which sets out its funding criteria for arts centres from 2020 onwards.  </p><p>Applications are being invited under three separate Streams as follows. </p><p><b>Stream A</b>will offer grants up to &euro;50,000 for small enhancement/expansion/ refurbishment projects which may involve construction works to arts and culture facilities and/or upgrading of equipment.</p><p><b>Stream B </b>will offer grants from &euro;50,000 up to &euro;300,000 for larger enhancement /expansion/ refurbishment projects involving construction works to arts and culture facilities.  </p><p><b>Stream C</b>will be a separate scheme aimed at the upgrading of visual artists&rsquo; workspaces. Applications for this Stream will be invited separately by Visual Artists Ireland. </p><p>All information on the Cultural Capital Scheme 2019 &ndash; 2022 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p></reply>

I will outline some key initiatives of relevance to 2019 in this reply.</p><p>The Creative Ireland Programme is a culture-based programme led by my Department designed to promote individual, community and national wellbeing. Its core proposition is that participation in cultural activity drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement.</p><p>Under Pillar 2 - 'Enabling Creativity in Every Community' of the Programme, in 2019, my Department allocated a sum of &euro;2m and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government allocated a sum of &euro;1m to all 31 local authorities including Kildare County Council (&euro;96,000 each approximately) to enable them support an extensive programme of activities, events and initiatives in each county.</p><p>The types of projects advanced by individual Local Authority Culture and Creativity Teams and supported by the Programme include arts projects, grant schemes, concerts, conferences, exhibitions, festivals, outreach projects, publications, research programmes, and workshops among other activities. They cover topics such as dance, film, music, poetry, storytelling, theatre and the visual arts. Further information is available on .</p><p>As well as this core support for local Creative Ireland programmes, each local authority is also provided with additional funding to support activities on Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g &ndash; the national day of creativity for children and young people which takes place in June.  This year each local authority including Kildare County Council was provided with &euro;15,000 (and in the case of each of the four Dublin local authorities, a sum of &euro;75,000 reflecting their larger populations) to activate Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g in their respective administrative areas.</p><p>Cumulatively, the above funding streams supported over 1,200 projects nationally in 2018 and it is expected they will fund a similar amount of projects in 2019.  However since processing of 2019 events is ongoing, such information will not be fully available to my Department until the end of 2019 whereupon it will be made publicly available on .</p><p>Also under the Creative Ireland Programme, the 2017 Creative Youth Plan commits to specific actions to increase and enhance access to a range of creative and cultural activities and practices for young people, including drama and music. As part of this commitment, my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills has in 2019 increased funding to Music Generation aimed at a national roll-out of the programme.  Earlier this year, Kerry, Tipperary, Kildare, Meath and Longford were announced as the next five counties to join the Music Generation programme.  Each of these counties will receive funding to create access to affordable performance music education for children and young people in their communities.</p><p>In addition, Action 8 of the Creative Youth Plan commits to &ldquo;measures will be developed to expand participation in drama/theatre outside of school, primarily by expansion of youth theatre&rdquo;, and recognises the importance of youth theatre in supporting and developing young people&rsquo;s mental wellbeing, critical and active citizenship, imaginations, and creative thinking.  Youth Theatre Ireland (YTI) is the national development organisation for youth theatre, supporting a network of youth theatres who deliver year-round programmes of drama workshops and performance opportunities to young people aged 12-21.  Indeed, I note that YTI currently list five such theatres in County Kildare.</p><p>The YTI project, supported by the Creative Ireland Programme, seeks to achieve the following:</p><p>- Establish a range of new local partnerships and build key relationships to expand YTI in new areas. The YTI Development Officer will identify potential leaders and participants.</p><p>- Provide a structured training programme (including accredited training in youth drama facilitation practice) to support the development of quality youth theatre practice.</p><p>- Provide seed-funding to new youth theatre groups as well as &lsquo;taster&rsquo; workshops for young people in local youth service and other appropriate settings.</p><p>- The pilot project seeks to support the establishment of 3 new youth theatre groups (in target counties where no YTI-affiliated group currently exists).</p><p>Also under Action 9 of the 2017 Creative Youth Plan there is a commitment to &ldquo;a strategy to develop and extend choral singing will be developed. The Creative Ireland Programme will work with key partners to develop a programme aimed at encouraging creative and sustainable engagement with singing and choral music for young people&rdquo;. The Creative Ireland Programme has partnered with Sing Ireland whose mission is to develop and support all forms of group singing in Ireland, by providing quality experiences through activities and by supporting the work of their members and the wider choral sector to progress this action.  I note that Sign Ireland has ten membership organisations listed within County Kildare.</p><p>Phase 1 of the project was undertaken in 2018, which sought to consult and build the case for YouthSing Ireland &ndash; this included commissioning of a piece of research now available in the library section of .  YouthSing Ireland, supported by the Creative Ireland Programme, seeks to achieve the following:</p><p>- Deliver enhanced Continuous Professional Development (CPD) offering to Primary and early secondary school education;</p><p>- The development of new resource material in Irish or of traditional Irish origin and an on-line resource for teachers (this element will be progressed in tandem with the Gaeltacht division of the Department of Culture, Heritage &amp;amp; Gaeltacht); and</p><p>- Develop a Sing Space which will bring young people and children, teachers and musicians together from the formal and non-formal settings to work collaboratively in a creative space locally.</p><p>The Arts Council which is funded by my Department also has a number of schemes and initiatives around the support of music and drama. Details of these can be accessed on its website at the following link: . Funding for the Arts Council has increased in recent years and now stands at &euro;75 million in 2019, an increase of &euro;6.8m or 10% over 2018. Much of this is invested by the Council through its Strategic Funding programme which includes grants to key arts organisations across the country. Additional funding is invested in projects and programmes, including Arts Grant Funding, Project Awards, Open Call, and grants for hundreds of productions, touring and festivals nationwide and details can be viewed on the Arts Council's website on its funding webpages.</p><p>I also announced in the context of Budget 2020 that funding of &euro;250,000 for the amateur theatre sector across Ireland will be made available next year.  Details of this funding arrangement will be announced shortly.</p></reply>

The Programme is a high-level, ambitious, all-of-government initiative to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation. The core proposition is that participation in cultural and creative activity promotes individual, community and national wellbeing.</p><p>The programme seeks to support each citizen &ndash; whether individually or collectively, in our personal lives or in our institutions &ndash; to realise our full creative potential, by encouraging, facilitating and supporting collaboration in order to cultivate a diverse, accessible &amp;amp; creative cultural ecosystem that sustains wellbeing for all.</p><p>Under the Creative Ireland Programme, I launched a Creative Youth Plan with the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in December 2017.  This aims to give every child practical access to tuition, experience and participation in art, music, drama and coding by 2022.  This Plan works across:</p><p>- Schools: Enhancing arts and creativity initiatives in schools and early years settings.</p><p>- Teacher CPD: Increasing and enhancing teacher continuing professional development opportunities across primary, post-primary and early years settings.</p><p>- Out-of-School: Improving cross-sectoral collaboration to support creativity for children and young people in the community.</p><p>My Department, through the Creative Youth Plan of the Creative Ireland Programme, and in collaboration with the Departments of Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs as well as the Arts Council has invested heavily in the promotion of arts in schools and encouraging schools to participate in arts-based activities.  The principal initiatives within the formal/school setting are Creative Schools and Creative Clusters and further information on these programmes is included below.  A number of other pilots and initiatives have been developed and/or supported to help deliver the Creative Youth Plan and some further information on a selection of individual initiatives is also outlined below. </p><p>1.The <b>Creative Schools</b>pilot is one of the flagship projects of the Creative Youth Plan, which seeks to enable the creative potential of every child and young person. Creative Schools aims to understand, develop and celebrate the arts and creativity as a core aspect of school life. It strives to foster children and young people&rsquo;s creativity, potential and participation in the arts as an integral part of their education. The initiative recognises that the arts are a powerful means through which children and young people can explore communication and collaboration, stimulate their imaginations to be inventive, and harness their boundless curiosity.</p><p>1.Schools selected to participate in the programme do so on a two-year cycle - the first to support them in developing a feasible creative plan for the school, and the second to enable them to implement this plan.  Each participating school is provided with access to a Creative Associate, who are essential in embedding inspirational and sustainable creative practices in teaching and learning.  Creative Associates are a mixture of practising artists and teachers with an understanding of creativity and its potential to transform the lives of children and young people. In addition, each school is allocated an annual grant of &euro;2,000 to implement their plans.</p><p><b>1. Creative Clusters</b>are groups of 2-5 schools, within an education centre, coming together to work on a Creative Project.  A facilitator provided by the Education Centre will help them formulate the plan and &euro;2,500 is provided to each cluster to put this plan into action.  Projects include coding, drama, Green Forest and Wellbeing.</p><p><b>1.Continuing Professional Development</b>(CPD) for teachers and for artists working in partnership with teachers is crucial to the long-term success and sustainability of the overall Creative Youth Plan. In order to achieve the long-term objective of cultural and creative education, it&rsquo;s necessary to build a critical mass of education and arts professionals who are versed in the theoretical frameworks of arts and creativity education, and equipped with the skills and techniques for delivering programmes.  CPD programmes continue to be rolled out across Early Years, Primary and Post-Primary settings.</p><p><b>1. National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals</b>(NAPD) &ndash; a representative body for Principals and Deputy Principals &ndash; operates the Creative Engagement programme in Post Primary settings.Under the programme, grants up to &euro;2,000 are awarded to schools for art education under clearly set criteria and undertaken on a jointly funded basis with the school involved.  The projects involved allow art practitioners to work with students in schools to allow students to produce work in visual art, music, theatre, dance, film and poetry. This programme strives to encourage creativity and initiative, and complements curricular learning in the arts, heritage and culture. NAPD envisions an education system energised through the arts and where creativity is a core activity in the post primary curriculum.</p><p><b>1. Music Generation</b>is Ireland&rsquo;s National Music Education Programme that aims to transform the lives of children and young people through access to high quality performance music education in their locality. Initiated by Music Network, Music Generation has been co-funded by U2, The Ireland Funds, the Department of Education and Skills and Local Music Education Partnerships.  The national roll-out of Music Generation is one of the actions being implemented in the Creative Youth Programme.</p></reply>
