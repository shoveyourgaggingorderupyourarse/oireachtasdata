I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares.  Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) in December 2009, the NTA is the statutory body with responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services, provided under public service contracts and shared systems such as the Leap Card. However, I will pass on the Deputy's concerns in relation to commuters in south County Kildare stations to the NTA.</p>  <p>  The NTA also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  </p>  <p>  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services. In 2019, the Irish Exchequer will provide just over &euro;300m in subvention for public service obligation (PSO) transport services and Rural Transport Local Link services.  </p>  <p>  The NTA have informed me that it is important to distinguish between two aspects when determining fares, i.e., the fare zone and the fare payment system. </p>  <p>  Due to Dublin&rsquo;s large population it is possible to achieve significant economies of scale in the operation of rail services.  Accordingly, it is possible to have an urban fare zone, called the Short Hop Zone, offering discounted fares. This type of urban fare structure is common in many major cities internationally.  The Leap Card can be used for rail travel between stations within the Short Hop Zone. This Zone includes all stations in the Dublin area from Kilcoole to Balbriggan and Commuter Stations from Dublin City Centre to Kilcock and from Dublin Heuston to Sallins and Naas.</p>  <p>  However, the NTA has indicated that it is not possible to offer the same discounted fares across the rest of the rail network as that would put an unsustainable financial strain on Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Accordingly, the NTA has no immediate plans to extend the current boundaries of the Short Hop Zone around Dublin. </p>  <p>  Leap Card is not an optimal system for the payment of rail fares in areas outside the Short Hop Zone as customers would need to maintain a significant balance on their Leap Card.  Accordingly, the NTA have no plans to make Leap Card available across the national rail network.  However, even if Leap Card was made available as a means of payment for rail fares nationally, it would not be possible to reduce fares in areas outside the Short Hop Zone for the reason I have already mentioned.</p>  <p>  The mobile ticketing service is the first phase of the NTA&rsquo;s Next Generation Ticketing (NGT) programme, which seeks to implement new and more flexible ticketing systems, provide additional ways of paying for travel and improve the overall customer experience.  The NGT programme will eventually lead to the replacement of the Leap Card system with this improved alternative.</p></reply>

Levels further than that distance typically fall back to within &ldquo;background concentration&rdquo; level.</p><p>Notwithstanding that important clarification, I am clear that we need to increase not just the sustainable options available, but also the numbers of people choosing to use those options too.</p><p>I am glad to say that <i>Project Ireland 2040 </i>provides for a significantly enhanced investment programme with measures to be funded in the short, medium and longer term.</p><p>In the short term, we have increased funding to support expanded bus and rail services throughout Dublin Mid-West, like for example the extra bus services in the Lucan area earlier this year or the increase in trains now serving Clondalkin-Fonthill and taking the Phoenix Park tunnel into the city centre. I have no doubt the Deputy has noticed a number of hybrid buses which Dublin Bus are now operating in the area as part of a trial and that is also very welcome. These improvements and expansions are resulting in increased levels of patronage and that's obviously important. </p><p>In the medium term we are rolling out BusConnects which will massively improve the bus infrastructure and active travel infrastructure in the area and result in much improved services. It will also mean we switch the entire bus fleet toward lower emission technologies and I have no doubt the Deputy supports the roll out of that programme as quickly as I do. On rail we are funding the electrification of the existing rail line in Dublin Mid-West as part of the DART Expansion Programme. </p><p>And we are planning for the longer term too through the funding of the appraisal, planning and design of a new Luas line right through the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency.</p><p>I look forward to the Deputy&rsquo;s continued support on the ground in relation to all of these improvements as we look to deliver improved and expanded public transport and active travel infrastructure across Dublin Mid-West.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-02a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100200069#WRA01300"><p>Firstly, I would like to explain that, as Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.  Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, development and construction of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p><p>The National Development Plan (NDP), which has been developed by Government to underpin the implementation of the National Planning Framework, provides the strategic and financial framework for Tll's national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027. The focus of Tll's activities over the coming years is, therefore, being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes that are listed in the NDP.</p><p>Following consultation with TII, I can provide an overview of national road developments in County Meath, to which the Deputy refers.</p><p>The proposed  <b>N2 Slane Bypass </b>is included  amongst a number of major national road  schemes that are identified for development during the period of the NDP. The scheme is also contained in the National Transport  Authority (NTA) Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area. </p><p>The project is currently at route selection stage. Meath County Council have also commissioned a supplementary assessment of East-West options in relation to Slane. This process is well advanced and once the preferred route is identified, the scheme will be progressed through planning and design.  A Business case will then be prepared for the approval of both my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform. In addition, the statutory documentation will be prepared, including the environmental impact assessment. Meath County Council have indicated that the scheme will be lodged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2021, post the adoption of the new County Development Plan. TII has provided an allocation of &euro;1m to Meath County Council for the scheme this year.</p><p>The proposed <b>N2 Rath Roundabout to Kilmoon Cross scheme </b>is also included amongst a number of major national road schemes that were identified in the NDP for progression through pre-appraisal and early planning during 2018. In this regard, the Project Pre-Appraisal for the proposed scheme has been approved. </p><p>This approx. 6 km scheme will address the existing operational and safety problems on this section of the N2, which has an annual average daily traffic of circa 16,000 vehicles per day and experiences considerable peak time congestion.</p><p>Meath County Council has engaged the services of Technical Advisors to commence the planning and design of the scheme.  I am advised that it typically takes three to five years from this point through Phases 1 &ndash; 4 of the Project Management Guidelines, in order to have the scheme ready to submit to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning approval. This year, TII has provided an allocation to Meath Co. Co. of &euro;250,000 to allow the scheme to progress to planning and design.</p><p>The <b>N51 Dunmoe Phase 2 scheme </b>comprises the construction of approximately 4 km of single carriageway and associated ancillary and consequential works, including the provision of side roads, accommodation works/roads, junctions, from the townland of Blackcastle Demesne to the townlands of Cruicetown and Pighill in County Meath. An Oral Hearing was held on 12<sup>th</sup>July 2018 and An Bord Pleanala confirmed the CPO for the scheme in October 2018. Meath Co Co are currently progressing the final design and tender documents and intend to go to tender for this scheme in 2020.TII has provided an allocation to Meath Co. Co. of &euro;150,000 for the scheme this year.</p><p><b>Regional and Local Roads</b></p><p>As regards regional and local roads, the maintenance and improvement of these roads  is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council.</p><p>During the recession there were substantial cutbacks in the funding available for State grants for national, regional and local road programmes.  Project Ireland 2040 does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network.  Grants in the three main grant categories (Restoration Improvement, Discretionary Grant and Restoration Maintenance) are allocated based on the length of the road network within a local authority area and taking  traffic factors into account.  </p><p>I have been pleased to be able to allocate significantly increased grant funding to Meath County Council in respect of regional and local roads over the last two years. In this context grant allocations to Meath in 2019 total &euro;19,676,500 which is an increase of over 45% compared to the 2017 allocation.  </p><p>While the bulk of the funding for regional and local roads under Project Ireland 2040 is earmarked for maintenance and renewal works, provision has been made for grant funding towards the cost of 12 significant capital road improvement schemes.  The upgrade of the Bettystown to Laytown Link Road is one of these projects.  Following the confirmation by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of the Compulsory Purchase Order related to the scheme, the detailed project appraisal has now been submitted to the Department for consideration.</p><p>Funding has also been allocated this year under the Specific Improvement Grant Programme to progress proposed safety improvement schemes at Curragha junction and Phase 1 of the R162 Kilberry traffic calming scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-02a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100200069#WRA01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 95 together.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. </p>  <p>  The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of Public Services Obligation (PSO) contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The NTA also has been given statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services. </p>  <p>  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between the income from fares and the cost of operating services. In 2019, the Irish Exchequer will provide just over &euro;300 million in subvention for public service obligation (PSO) transport services and Rural Transport Local Link services.  </p>  <p>  I understand from the NTA that, in 2018, passengers paid &euro;625 million in fares on subsidised bus and rail services. Therefore, if such services were to be provided free to passengers, then the expected cost to the Exchequer would be in excess of the &euro;625m collected in fares in 2018.  This amount would be additional to the 2019 Exchequer allocation of &euro;300m for PSO support and the further amount (&euro;95m allocation for 2019) that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection pays to public transport providers in respect of its Free Travel Scheme which provides free transport to almost 1 million people in the State, including all people aged over 66 living permanently here, along with some other qualifying people.</p>  <p>  So taking round approximate figures, the Deputies idea would cost the taxpayer about &euro;625 million per year, in addition to the &euro;400 million that the Exchequer already spends on public transport services.  And this is just the cost of the actual services;  it does not count the Exchequer investment in public transport and active travel infrastructure which in 2019 is about &euro;480 million.</p>  <p>  These are just the estimates of the full year cost of providing a windfall of free travel to everyone who is an existing passenger.  The figures do not factor in the cost of providing the additional fleet, depots, drivers, etc. that would be needed to meet the likely resultant substantial increase in passenger numbers if fares were reduced or eliminated.  In summary Introducing free public transport for all users would require substantial additional funding by the taxpayer or from other sources;  the Deputies have not indicated how they propose that this would be funded.</p>  <p>  The Deputies are correct in focusing on the need to reduce private car emissions and also to stimulate and support increased uptake of public transport.  That is exactly the Government's approach as set out in our recent Climate Plan.  According to 2017 emission estimates:</p>  <p>  - Around 52% of transport emissions come from private car use;</p>  <p>  - Just over 18% comes from the freight sector; and</p>  <p>  - Around 4.4% of emissions come from the public transport fleet.</p>  <p>  As such, it is clear that inroads must be made in reducing the dominance of the private car in Ireland&rsquo;s transport sector.</p>  <p>  Modal shift from the private car to sustainable means of transport remains central to the transport sector&rsquo;s response to climate change.  Investment in public transport has supported an increase of almost 58m journeys annually on subsidised public transport and commercial bus service since 2012.  Last year we saw an increase of 16.3 million passenger journeys provided by Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail, Luas and Go-Ahead Ireland on PSO services.  That is an increase of over 6.5% compared to 2017.  I think the Deputies would agree that this increase in passenger growth is very positive.  The growth in public transport services has been supported by higher levels of subvention in 2016, 2017 and 2018 and as I mentioned earlier it was increased again this year to provide a total allocation of over &euro;300 million.</p>  <p>  In order to reduce the prevalence of the private car and encourage a shift to more sustainable forms of transport, a number of key policy measures to increase public transport capacity will be progressed over the next decade.  The National Development Plan has earmarked &euro;8.6 billion for investment in public and sustainable transport to 2027. By maintaining a focus on expanding the carrying capacity of our public transport over the coming years, we can help address the largest sustainability challenge in thetransport sector, which is shifting more journeys from private motoring towards suitable alternatives in public transport and active travel.</p></reply>

As our population and economic performance grows, more journeys are created only adding to the issue.  Over time, rising travel demand coupled with a scarcity of space to expand road supply will exacerbate the issues that we see in our cities today.  We estimate that, without intervention, by 2040 commuting trips nationally could rise by as much as 35% over current levels.  So, my focus must strongly remain on ensuring sustainable and efficient movement of people and goods on the transport network, and pursuing suitable measures to safeguard against congestion.</p><p>In 2017 my Department estimated that congestion could have a cost of over &euro;2 billion per annum by 2033 in the absence of appropriate intervention.  Such a cost would have a substantial impact on our national economic competitiveness. There is also a social cost to our citizens spending more time in unnecessary traffic delays. In addition, congestion also negatively impacts on our national carbon emissions and can cause localised air quality issues. So there are many motivations to tackle congestion. </p><p>We are addressing some congestion issues by encouraging more people to move away from their private passenger cars to public transport and active travel where practical.  To this end, a significant investment of &euro;8.6 billion has been earmarked under the <i>National Development Plan</i>to increase the capacity and attractiveness of sustainable mobility.  Major forthcoming projects such as <i>MetroLink,</i>the <i>DART Expansion Programme</i>and <i>BusConnects</i>will significantly increase public transport capacity providing a viable and attractive alternative to private cars for more people, for more of their journeys.  And the substantial step-up in walking and cycling infrastructure investment will also increase the shift to active modes. </p><p>In parallel, demand management measures must also be considered, including the potential role of congestion charging.  Indeed, under the <i>Climate Action Plan</i>my Department is committed to examining a range of demand management measures for Irish cities.  The study will review international best practice and recommend the most appropriate responses for Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, taking into account overall transport strategies and the unique make-up of each of the cities. We will work in close collaboration with the relevant local authorities and I expect the results of this study are to be published next Autumn.</p></reply>

I think there might well be a potential for a communications campaign around its application to e-bikes to ensure people are aware of that fact.</p>  <p>  The Deputy might say that the overall cap on the Bike-to-Work scheme should be lifted given the greater cost of e-bikes as opposed to other bikes; however, I would say that, as percentage of overall potential cost, it still represents a significant level of assistance. </p>  <p>  I am about to launch a consultation on sustainable mobility policy and, as part of that, I would welcome engagement with the Deputy on any particular incentives he might have in mind. I think it important that any fiscal incentive is supported by appropriate analysis and forms part of an overall policy framework:  an approach I would hope he supports.</p></reply>

The operation and provision of services on the rail network are matters for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in the first instance, which, in consultation with the National Transport Authority (NTA), is currently examining how best to source additional rolling stock as efficiently and effectively as possible, while ensuring value for money for the taxpayer in that regard. </p><p>I acknowledge the fact that at certain times of the day, some rail services are currently crowded due to the level of demand. The Deputy can be assured that the safe operation of the rail network and services is the overriding priority at all times of both the company and, of course, the Commission for Railway Regulation, which is the independent, statutory body charged with overseeing the safety of our network.</p><p>From late September to early December is the busiest commuter period of the year for all transport modes, given the return of third-level educational institutions. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann launched the website peaktime.ie on September 23rd.</p><p>I am advised by Irish Rail that its intention in launching peaktime.ie was not to &ldquo;persuade workers to avoid rush-hour DART times on weekday mornings&rdquo;, but to equip those commuters who have flexibility in their travel times with information on demand levels on DARTs serving their stations, thus enabling them to decide their travel times based on the available options. </p><p>With one in six weekday DART journeys made between 8am and 9am, the morning peak is particularly concentrated. The information provided on peaktime.ie may enable some commuters to travel at a time when there is greater capacity, thus increasing overall the contribution of DART to providing sustainable transport options for a greater number of commuters and helping those commuters make the modal shift from private to public transport. </p><p>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann increased DART frequency to a 10-minute weekday service from 7am to 8pm in September 2018, and is maximising capacity within its existing fleet at the busiest times. These changes mean that there remains scope for further growth in passenger numbers at the busiest times. However, capacity will come under increasing pressure, based on economic and employment growth forecasts. This is the case not only for DART, but also peak Commuter and Intercity services. </p><p>Currently, with the existing rail fleet fully deployed at peak times, the NTA in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are examining options in the short, medium and longer term for additional train capacity to meet the increased commuter services demand across the network.  I can confirm that my Department has now received a business case from the National Transport Authority-Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in relation to the proposed purchase of 41 InterCity Rail (ICR) Cars.  As the Deputy is aware, all public expenditure must comply with the <i>Public Spending Code</i>which sets out the requirements to which sponsoring agencies and sanctioning authorities must adhere, including the requirement that any project with an expected cost of &euro;100 million or more must obtain specific approval from Government. In line with the <i>Public Spending Code</i>, that business case is currently being considered by my Department and once that consideration is complete I will seek Government's decision in relation to same.  Pending Government approval to proceed, NTA-Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann anticipate delivery of the ICRs will commence in late 2021 and enter into service in early 2022. </p><p>  Separately, in May of this year NTA-I&Eacute; began a tender process for up to 600 electric and battery-electric powered carriages over a 10 year period.</p></reply>

This investment will transform our public transport network and enable more people choose sustainable mobility as their preferred mode of transport.</p><p>This increased level of investment allows for a range of short, medium and longer term responses as the Deputies have referred.</p><p>In the short term, the size of the Public Service Obligation (PSO) bus fleet has increased and that, together with service improvements, has meant increased and improved service provision. This is a significant development as the bus is by far the most important part of our public transport network. </p><p>On the Luas network, the first of the extensions to the Luas Green Line fleet has entered service with the remaining 25 extensions set to enter service on a rolling basis from now on. Next year will also see delivery of the 8 additional trams that have been ordered as part of the Luas Green Line Capacity Enhancement Project. </p><p>On rail while there have been improvements introduced last year in peak-time services, and this year in off-peak services, there are two fundamental constraints, namely the need to physically expand the fleet through the purchase of additional carriages and also the need to improve the overall management of the network. </p><p>And I am pleased to say there is progress underway in relation to both.  In relation to the fleet, a business case for the purchase of 41 additional InterCity Railcars is currently under consideration by my Department in line with the Public Spending Code. That business case will be submitted to Government for its approval and it is expected that the new fleet will be delivered by 2021. </p><p>Separately, in May this year the National Transport Authority (NTA) and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann commenced pre-qualifying in relation to a 10-year procurement framework for electric and battery-electric units which will massively expand the fleet. </p><p>In the summer, the Government approved the development of a new National Train Control Centre and contracts on this are expected to be awarded before the end of the year.</p><p>In the medium and longer term, the Deputies will acknowledge the on-going development of BusConnects, DART Expansion and MetroLink each of which will transform the capacity of the relevant public transport modes and create better linkages between them too. </p><p>I would hope that Deputies can see that there are a range of measures underway to improve our public transport network and services.</p></reply>

However, the switch to alternative fuels and technologies cannot be effected without a considerable State investment in supporting refueling infrastructure. </p><p>In order to meet our commitment under the <i>National Development Plan</i>to cease purchase of diesel-only buses from July this year, a decision was taken by the National Transport Authority (NTA), which is responsible for procurement of vehicles in the public service obligation (PSO) fleets, to purchase hybrid-electric buses in the short term. Hybrid bus technology acts to reduce transport emissions without the need for costly supporting infrastructure to be made immediately available. This enables the fleet replacement and fleet expansion necessary to support rising travel demand to continue uninterrupted;  it also ensures that our longer-term procurement decisions will not need to take into account potentially hasty investment made in short-term infrastructure.  Care must be taken to avoid investment in technologies which may be suitable for our current, but not our future public transport needs.</p><p>The <i>Climate Action Plan</i>sets out a clear commitment that, by the end of 2020, the first one hundred low-emission buses will have entered the urban bus fleet.  Also, the NTA will prepare and publish a medium-term fleet technology pathway for the urban public bus fleet by year end, in line with the commitment set out in the <i>Climate Action Plan</i>. The findings of the Low-Emission Bus Trial are expected to inform this decision, taken together with ongoing market analysis and public fleet procurement requirements under the EU Clean Vehicles Directive. My Department will continue to engage closely with the NTA on the development of this longer-term procurement strategy, which will see our public transport sector become steadily cleaner and greener in the coming years.</p><p>Notably, the Clean Vehicles Directive at EU level will oblige Ireland to incorporate zero-emission technologies, such as fully electric or hydrogen, into the bus fleet as we move towards 2030, and consequently consideration of electric buses is ongoing.  Indeed, and as I have mentioned, the findings of the Low-Emission Bus Trials show that electric buses performed strongly across a range of metrics.  In addition, hybrid-electric technology, where deployed in conjunction with certain biofuels, also emerged as a potentially viable alternative, as did biogas.  The overall results suggest that electrification represents a feasible option for fleet transition that could help us to tackle our carbon emissions, our air quality and increase our use of renewable energy in transport.  </p><p>It is, however, important to note that double-deck full electric models were not available to trial and that these results refer to single-deck electric vehicles.  There are a number of reasons for this;  notably, right-hand drive vehicles (which Ireland would need) represent only a small part of the EU market, which can limit the number of suppliers and manufacturers open to us. </p><p>Furthermore, given our rising travel demand and the predominant role of the PSO fleet in our public transport system, double-deck buses are the most appropriate vehicle type for Irish circumstances. The articulated single-deck vehicles deployed in various continental cities, which do not offer the same ratio of standing to seating passengers, are not a suitable alternative due to these capacity concerns. While fully electric single-deck buses have been commercially available for some time, electric double-deck pilot models are only now becoming available. Up until this year, Transport for London (TFL), which operates a fleet of about 4,000 vehicles, had just two electric double-deck buses in operation. I understand that TFL is currently in the process of acquiring a further 68 electric double-deck buses that will be deployed on two specific routes for in-service performance monitoring and evaluation. It is worth noting that Irish bus routes tend to be long and that battery capacity for fully electric vehicles may be a concern. However, it is expected that battery capacity will further improve over the next few years, making it feasible to fully transition to electric vehicles at that stage. </p><p>While we await the development of higher battery capacity double deck bus fleet, the approach the NTA is pursuing is to begin the electrification pathway by purchasing diesel-electric hybrid vehicles.</p></reply>

The answer is that they will.</p>  <p>  Specifically, driving across the border in a no-deal Brexit scenario will raise three issues.  The first is the driving licence.  Under the 1949 Geneva Convention on international road traffic, people will be able to drive here on their Northern Ireland licences, on a visitor basis.  No additional documentation will be required in this regard.</p>  <p>  Next, there is the question of insurance.  There is a international system, pre-dating the EU, under which a so-called 'Green Card' acts as proof of motor insurance in international travel.  This system was created to facilitate international road traffic by providing for a single standard document as proof of motor insurance across all participating countries, rather than requiring people to carry different documentation for each country they enter.  </p>  <p>  Under EU law, Green Cards are not required for travel within the EU.  If the UK becomes a Third Country without a deal, the default position will be that Green Cards will be required for UK-registered vehicles entering the EU from the UK.  EU law does, however, provide that the EU Commission should set a date after which Green Cards will not be required from a given Third Country, if the Motor Insurers' Bureaux of all the Member States so request.  This request was made late last year.  The Commission has yet to make a decision on setting a date.  Ireland has continued to request that the Commission make a decision, so that Green Cards will not be required. </p>  <p>  The third and final matter is whether vehicles should have a national identification sticker.  These stickers are prescribed under international road traffic conventions, including the Geneva Convention which I mentioned, and which applies between Ireland and the UK.  The purpose of the sticker is largely to identify a vehicle as visiting rather than as based in the jurisdiction, for tax purposes.  However, there is no offence of not having a sticker of this kind in Irish road traffic legislation.  While I need hardly point out that a person is unlikely to be made liable for vehicle tax simply as a result of not having an international sticker, this is essentially a matter for Revenue.  I understand that there is likewise no offence of not having a sticker in UK law.</p></reply>

However it is clear that the impacts would be very damaging.

I secured &euro;287m to fund our PSO services in 2019.</p><p>International experience indicates that introducing competitive tension into our PSO bus market (i.e. a mixture of direct award and then competitively tendered contracts) should allow us to capture potential benefits as regards value for money in terms of the use of taxpayers' money in securing the provision of PSO services.</p><p>We are always looking for ways to improve our public transport services and the NTA conducting an open, competitive process as part of providing enhanced and expanded services for passengers, and then monitoring and implementing its contacts, is part of that improvement process. Passengers are at the centre of our public transport policy  and competitive tendering encourages everybody to focus on their customer&rsquo;s needs. It also encourages innovation and improvements to service quality for bus passengers. </p><p>All public transport services - whether they are provided by direct award contracts or through competitive tender - will continue to be regulated by the NTA so that LEAP, Free Travel Pass, Real Time Information etc. will all continue to operate on these services and fares will continue to be regulated by NTA.</p><p>The NTA's current direct award public service obligation (PSO) contracts with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus expire at the end of November 2019.  The NTA is required to follow a statutory process underpinned by both EU and national legislation before the direct award contracts may be renewed.  </p><p>As part of this process, the NTA launched a public consultation process in early October 2018 in relation to the bus services contracts.  This consultation informed the NTA's decision on the renewal of the contracts, including in relation to the Direct Award / Competitive Tender balance of contracts for Bus &Eacute;ireann. </p><p>Regarding the direct award contracts post-2019 in relation to Bus &Eacute;ireann, the NTA has announced that it will: </p><p>- directly award an equivalent service level that the company has in December 2019;  </p><p>- amend that contract in 2021 to reduce it by up to 5% of services; and </p><p>- provide the removed services through a separate contract following an open competitive tender process.</p><p>It will be open to Bus &Eacute;ireann to tender for these services if they so wish.</p><p>The new direct award contracts proposed by NTA will provide a guaranteed level of PSO funding to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann up to 2024. The NTA decided that Dublin Bus should retain service levels at 2019 levels at least, and that there should be no further tendering processes during the term of the new contract which would reduce service levels by the company.</p><p>To conclude, the NTA has the statutory responsibility to award PSO contracts and to determine the appropriate mix of directly awarded and competitively tendered PSO services.  Under the law, this is not an area in which I have a role.</p></reply>

There is also an offshoot to  the Core Port of Shannon Foynes. The Dublin to Rosslare Europort railway line is on the Comprehensive TEN-T network.  Rosslare Harbour is also on the TEN-T Comprehensive Network and doesn&rsquo;t meet the threshold for TEN-T Core port status. The European Commission's methodology for establishing the core and comprehensive layers of the network are available online. I have not applied to the Commission to designate the Dublin to Rosslare railway line as part of the Core Network.</p>  <p>  With regard to the amending the TEN-T network, the EU Transport Commissioner, Violeta Bulc, wrote to EU Transport Ministers in February 2019, announcing that the European Commission is advancing the review of the TEN-T Network, which was due to take place no later than December 2023. This review process will include: an evaluation study, due to be completed in spring 2020; a public stakeholder consultation, which was open for contributions from April to July 2019; and targeted consultations with Member States and a wide range of stakeholders expected to take place later this year. Following the conclusion of the Commission&rsquo;s review, a legislative proposal to amend the TEN-T Regulation may follow.</p>  <p>  In August 2019, honouring a Programme for a Partnership Government commitment,  I made a submission to Commissioner Bulc on the matter of reviewing the TEN-T network in which I outlined national policy developments since the TEN-T Regulation came into force in 2013. These developments include the Government's National Development Plan and National Planning Framework, jointly referred to as Project Ireland 2040, and the implications of Brexit on Ireland's international connectivity. In relation to Rosslare Europort, while State investment is not permitted under EU Regulations on State Aid, Project 2040 sets out the Government's plans in relation to roads projects such as the recently opened Gorey to Enniscorthy stretch of the M11 and the planned Oilgate to Rosslare stretch of the N11/N25.</p>  <p>  As regards the potential for EU funding for the development of Rosslare Europort going forward, the Deputy will be aware that Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) co-funding is available to projects on both the comprehensive and the core parts of the TEN-T Network, subject to such projects satisfying the eligibility criteria of a given call for proposals, and being selected in the evaluation process.</p>  <p>   While the current CEF programme finishes at the end of 2020, a proposal for a new CEF Regulation for the period 2021 &ndash;2027 was published by the European Commission in May 2018. Ireland has advocated at EU level for projects on our comprehensive network to continue to be eligible for co-funding during the period 2021 - 2027.</p>  <p>   Ireland submitted written comments to the European Commission in conjunction with two other island Member States, Cyprus and Malta, calling for projects on the comprehensive network in Member States which have no land border with another Member State to be included as eligible actions. This position was accepted by the Commission during negotiations, and as a result the latest text of the proposal retains this amendment.

This year, Tourism Ireland has commenced the implementation of a strategy for growth in these markets. In Budget 2019, I provided almost &euro;4 million in additional funding to Tourism Ireland for this purpose. China, as the largest source of outbound tourism in the world, is one of the main emerging markets we are targeting. </p><p>While the resources allocated to any particular market is an operational matter for Tourism Ireland, I am aware that the additional funding I provided has allowed the agency to substanitally increase its activity in the Chinese market this year. It has doubled its investment to &euro;1 million and increased its on the ground marketing team to 12, including a presence in Hong Kong. It has also increased its publicity, digital and social media activity in the market and continues to interact with the travel trade in the market.</p><p>In order to make the most of the potential from a market such as China, it is important that the industry here is sufficiently prepared in order to be able to offer visitors a quality experience which meets their requirements. To this end, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working with Irish tourism businesses across the country to help them capitalise on this potential by training them in how to meet the specific needs of the Chinese visitor. Its <i>Get China Ready </i>programme was developed in partnership with Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland and is jointly delivered with the support of the Centre for Competitiveness, which is the licensed provider of China Outbound Tourism Research Institute programmes in Ireland. </p><p>With the support of Government, the work being done by the tourism agencies both in China and here in Ireland, together with the industry, leaves us well placed to attract increased tourism from China in the coming years.</p></reply>

Consultations regarding Brexit with key maritime stakeholders has included a Transport and Logistics All Island Sectoral meeting in Dundalk in January 2017, three Brexit Maritime Transport Workshops / Seminars (in April 2017, March 2018, and in January 2019) with a further Brexit Maritime Connectivity &lsquo;Be prepared&rsquo; Workshop held on 4<sup>th</sup>September 2019, together with on going contact with various stakeholders.</p><p>A significant proportion of our goods destined for Continental European markets are transported via the UK landbridge to access these markets. Brexit could impact on the efficiency of the landbridge route particularly where there are increased border and custom procedures and associated delays, or were the UK to subsequently apply differing standards, road charging or regulatory regimes. The landbridge is the fastest route to continental Europe and as such is relied upon for the transport of time-sensitive products, such as some in the fresh agri-food/perishable goods sector, just-in-time and high value goods. Any delays or barriers to this key route to European markets will be detrimental for certain sectors. Significant work has been and continues to be undertaken through the Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in seeking to ensure continued access through the landbridge to markets in continental Europe.</p><p>Eight Meetings have been held with shipping companies and shipping interests by my Department and the IMDO in January and February 2019.  These discussions with shipping companies have been continued by my Department since then, up to recent days, while the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) who report to my Department have been consulting extensively with the Maritime sector, including shipping, port and other maritime interests regarding Brexit issues on an ongoing basis.  A number of consistent views has emerged from the meetings and consultations with the shipping companies.  Shipping companies remain confident that the market will be responsive in meeting any challenge in a no-deal scenario should there be a switch in demand to direct services. </p><p>In the context of Brexit, there has already been a significant market response evidencing the capacity of market participants to respond to shifts in trade patterns resulting from Brexit. This includes: </p><p>- In 2018, CLdN lauched <i>MV Celine, the world&rsquo;s largest RoRo vessel</i>, and in 2019 launched the <i>MV Laureline RoRo vessel,</i>significantly increasing capacity on the Dublin-Rotterdam and Dublin-Zeebrugge routes.  </p><p>- In May 2018 Brittany Ferries commenced a service from Cork to Santander and Roscoff.  </p><p>- Irish Ferries investment of &euro;150 million in its newest passenger and freight vessel, <i>MV W.B. Yeats</i>, provides year-round freight capacity between Ireland and France of 165 HGVs per sailing or 60,600 HGVs per annum and a vessel of a similar size is due to be delivered on the Irish sea routes in 2020. - In July 2019, BG Freight Line announced the commencement of a direct Waterford-Rotterdam route weekly Lo/Lo freight service, which will act as a deep sea feeder through Rotterdam port and onwards to worldwide destinations for Irish importers and exporters. </p><p>I am confident in the light of my Department&rsquo;s consultation with shipping companies, and the previous responses of shipping operators, that shipping services can be expected to adapt to changing market demands that may arise as a consequence of Brexit and we have seen the evidence of this over the last few years with the increase in shipping capacity on direct routes to continental ports that I have mentioned.</p></reply>

Accordingly, electric vehicles (EVs) are a prominent mitigation technology in the whole-of Government <i>Climate Action Plan</i>, which sets targets of 180,000 EVs on our roads by 2025, and 936,000 EVs by 2030. Clearly these targets are very challenging, and they are indicative of the scale of transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to reduce national emissions and reach its legally binding emission ceiling in future years.</p><p>It is widely expected that, over the coming years the combination of :</p><p>- improvements in technology,</p><p>- reductions in vehicle purchase prices,</p><p>- increasing driving ranges and model availabilities,</p><p>- coupled with Government incentives and new investment in the recharging network,</p><p>will maintain the current positive policy environment under which we have seen EV sales rise steeply over the past year, albeit from a low base. </p><p>In addition, car manufacturers will be stepping up production of EVs in the coming years due to an EU Regulation that sets production benchmarks for new cars and new vans being zero-emission. This should mean that more vehicles will be available for Irish consumers to purchase.  Accordingly, I am confident that we can make real progress towards the target by 2030. </p><p>To date, the Government, supported by the <i>Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, </i>has worked to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices.  As the Deputy will be aware, several of the principal supports, such as the EV Purchase Grant Scheme, the Domestic Charger Grant and the roll out of an extensive recharging network, fall under the remit of my colleague the Minister of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.  Support from the Minister for Finance has also been fundamental, with EVs now benefiting from favourable motor tax, vehicle registration tax (VRT) and benefit-in-kind (BIK) tax rates.  In my role, I am directly responsible for two initiatives supporting EV uptake rates: the Electric Vehicle Toll Incentive Scheme and the Electric Taxi Grant Scheme.</p><p>This concerted work across several Departments must continue if we are to accelerate the current trajectory of EV sales. Action 79 of the <i>Climate Action Plan</i>commits my Department to develop a <i>Roadmap</i>on the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies to drive significant ramp-up in passenger EVs and electric van sales from very early in the next decade; I will convene the relevant Departments before year-end to pursue this aim. </p><p>Collectively, I believe that these actions, alongside a supportive environment, will ensure that Ireland is well positioned to make the transition to electrification as efficiently as possible and progress the delivery of our collective ambition for nearly one million EVs by 2030<i>.</i></p></reply>

Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design, construction and development stages of individual road projects is a matter for </p><blockquote>(a)  the relevant road authority (i.e. local authorities) in relation to local and regional roads, or<br /><br />(b) Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned, in relation to national roads. </blockquote><p><b>Overview</b></p><p>The National Development Plan (NDP) provides the strategic and financial framework for the roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027.  In the ten years, over &euro;11 billion will be invested in the overall road network. </p><p>The National Development Plan (NDP) identifies two categories of national road improvement projects</p><p>The first covers projects to advance to construction, subject to the satisfactory outcome of project appraisal and development consent.  The second relates to projects at pre-appraisal and early planning to be assessed, to develop a pipeline of suitable projects.  Advancing projects in the second, pipeline. category will be subject to prioritisation within the overall national road programme and funding.</p><p>Having consulted with the relevant authorities, I can provide the following information and update to the Deputy on the Bonagee Link Road project, also referred to as the Letterkenny Inner Relief Road.</p><p>- In  Co. Donegal the Trans European Network-Transport (TEN&ndash;T)  Comprehensiveroad network runs from the Leitrim County  Boundary (on the outskirts of Bundoran to the Border with  Derry  in the Northeast at Bridgend, on the outskirts of Derry City, and  involves sections of the N13, N14 and N15.  </p><p>- In 2016 Donegal County Council commissioned a Corridor Needs Study on the TEN-T Comprehensive  network within Donegal.  The study identified projects to improve the TEN-T Comprehensive network to the required standard under TEN- T regulations.  The Studyidentified a priority list of schemes.  It recommended three  priority projects to advance: </p><p>- N15/N13  Ballybofey &ndash; Stranorlar Bypass  </p><p>- N56/N13/N14Letterkenny Bypass, and Letterkenny-Manorcunningham Dual Carriageway </p><p>- N14 Manorcunningham-Lifford Realignment, including the N14/N15 link to the A5in Northern Ireland</p><p>The Bonagee Link Road, or the Letterkenny Inner Relief Road, forms part of the proposed Letterkenny Bypass.  </p><p>Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) has provided an allocation of &euro;2.5m in 2019 to Donegal County Council to progress planning work on priority national road improvements projects that were identified in the study on the TEN-T Network I mentioned.  These projects are identified as Strategic Investment Priorities in the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the NDP. Under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) 2014-2020 Transport calls for proposals 2019, Donegal County Council applied for funding for the TEN-T project and have recently been successful in their application for funding for planning work under the 2019 call. </p><p><b>Current Status</b></p><p>Feasibility Studies for the priority schemes commenced in 2017 and the route selection process is ongoing.  Public consultations on identified route options were held in April and May 2018 in Letterkenny, Lifford and Ballybofey. </p><p>An Emerging Preferred Route Corridor for each section has now been identified.  Public Consultations on these Emerging Corridors took place in February 2019. A public display of the Stage 3 Preferred Options will be organised for later this year. </p><p>It can typically take 8 to 13 years to bring a major project from conception to completion.  There is no timeframe fixed yet for completing the Bonagee link road project, as it will need to obtain both Business Case approval and Planning Consent and will be subject to the availability of funding in the future and the of course the necessary approvals.</p><p>The specific preferred route selection process is on-going.

Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design, construction and development stages of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p><p>I fully recognise the demand pressures on the M50. </p><p><b>Enhancing Motorway Operation Services</b></p><p>Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), along with other stakeholders, is continuing to implement a number of measures on the M50 to manage demand and optimise operational efficiency, including:  </p><p>- enhanced vehicle recovery services;  </p><p>- establishment of an Interagency Incident Coordination Group;  </p><p>- changes to merging and diverging layouts at junctions;  </p><p>- the establishment of signed Emergency Diversion Routes; and </p><p>- improved access for incident support and emergency services.</p><p>TII has also commenced a project titled &lsquo;enhancing Motorway Operation Services&rsquo; which will include, inter alia, Variable Speed Limits and Lane Control Signalling.</p><p><b>Variable Speed Limits</b></p><p>The variable speed limit regime on the M50 will improve the operational efficiency of the motorway by smoothing traffic flow, improving journey time reliability and reducing the number of traffic collisions. Lane control signalling will also be installed as part of the project which will allow the closing off of lanes. </p><p>I can advise that my Department is progressing the legislative arrangements that will provide TII with the necessary powers to regulate and operate VSL on motorways.  The legislative proposals will be contained in the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. A General Scheme of the Bill, including the proposal for variable speed limits, was approved by Government for formal drafting last December, subject to two proposals within the Scheme being examined further in Cabinet Committee.  These two proposals - for graduated speeding penalties and the carrying of driving licences - have now been examined in detail at official level and will be considered by Cabinet Committee shortly. Once this process is completed, I hope to see work on drafting the Bill for publication completed, and to publish the Bill before the end of the year.</p><p>In the meantime I am advised that, in order to progress this important measure, TII is extending the motorway traffic control centre at Dublin Tunnel to cater for the additional workload from the introduction of VSL and is currently procuring the management systems and hardware for the operation and roll-out of VSL for the M50.  All the preparatory technical and logistical frameworks will need to be in place, by TII, before VSL can be introduced and become operational and as I have outlined, this work is on-going.It is expected that the enabling works which TII is undertaking will be completed in late 2019 or early 2020.</p><p><b>Public Transport Role</b></p><p>In addition, Project Ireland 2040 identifies a number of key public transport priorities including the BusConnects programme, MetroLink and the DART expansion programme. These will be delivered by the National Transport Authority (NTA) progressively and steadily over the short, medium and long term, to deliver a comprehensive public transport network that will match transport demand, alleviate congestion, provide an alternative to private car use and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade, all of which will have a positive effect on the M50.</p></reply>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland is planning to notify applicants, including those from Co. Kildare, by November 2019.</p><p>While there are currently no outstanding applications for Greenways in Co. Kildare, funding of &euro;1.7m was granted to Kildare County Council for work on the Grand Canal Greenway in June 2019.</p><p>In relation to Sports Capital Funding, the 2018 round of the Sports Capital Programme closed for applications on Friday 19th October last.  By that deadline, a record 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding.  186 of these applications were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January. 619 equipment only applications were assessed next and 466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8m were announced to these organisations in May.

In view of the detailed information contained in each application, I am advised that it will take a number of months to have all of them assessed.  </p><p>Accordingly, I expect that it will be towards the end of this year before any allocations are announced.</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on any possible changes at this time. </p>  <p>  As regards the relief, I am advised by Revenue that capital acquisitions tax relief is available in relation to certain business assets passing by way of gifts or inheritances. This &lsquo;business relief&rsquo; takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable value of gifted or inherited business property. For relief to apply, the business assets must constitute what is defined as &ldquo;relevant business property&rdquo;. Included in this definition are unincorporated businesses, unquoted shares in certain family companies and assets used wholly or mainly for the purposes of a business carried on by a family company or a partnership. A business consisting wholly or mainly of dealing in land, shares, securities or currencies or making or holding investments does not qualify for business relief.</p>  <p>  The relevant business assets must have been owned by the disponer for a minimum period prior to the gift or inheritance. The minimum period of such ownership for gifts is 5 years and for inheritances is 2 years.</p>  <p>  There is a &lsquo;past use&rsquo; test in that the relevant business assets must have been used wholly or mainly for the purpose of the business concerned throughout the 2-year period immediately prior to the gift or inheritance. The value attributable to assets not satisfying this &lsquo;past use&rsquo; test (known as &lsquo;excepted assets&rsquo;) is excluded from the relief. The operation of business relief does not include a &lsquo;future use&rsquo; test in respect of assets that may be excluded from the relief as &lsquo;excepted assets&rsquo;.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, as in the case of Presentation Secondary School, Milltown, a selection process may be necessary.

The purpose of this work by the Department is to develop a policy proposal to help support and strengthen small primary schools throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in principal release days will have to be considered as part of the annual budgetary process, alongside the many other demands in the education sector.</p></reply>

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015 but has not yet been fully commenced.  The Act provides for the establishment of new administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health). </p>  <p>  The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.  This lead in time frame ensures that sufficient staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. There are many complex strands to this preparatory work, including the involvement of multiple organisations.    </p>  <p>  A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service, together with the Director of the Decision Support Service, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service and this work is ongoing. </p>  <p>  A number of provisions of the 2015 Act were commenced in October 2016 in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016) commenced provisions of the Act to enable the recruitment of the Director of the Decision Support Service. Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn was appointed Director of the Decision Support Service on 2 October 2017.  </p>  <p>  The commencement of Part 8 of the Act, which provides a legislative framework for advance healthcare directives, is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health, under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 517 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 8 of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. The commenced provisions provide for the establishment by the Minister for Health of a multi-disciplinary group to make recommendations to the Director of the Decision Support Service in relation to codes of practice on advance healthcare directives. In anticipation of the completion of that process, the Minister for Health commenced the remainder of section 91 on 17 December 2018 (S.I. No. 527 of 2018).   </p>  <p>  The key preparations are being put in place under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for further commencement orders for the provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.   </p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made on preparing for commencement of the remainder of the 2015 Act. In April 2018, the Mental Health Commission engaged the consultancy firm BearingPoint to support the development of a detailed, costed plan to establish a fully operational Decision Support Service. The contract also includes ongoing project management support for the design and establishment of the organisation, business processes, IT systems and risk management framework.  </p>  <p>  The Mental Health Commission has also received sanction for the recruitment of a number of staff for the Decision Support Service and also a number of staff to provide shared services for the Mental Health Commission and Decision Support Service. These staff are being recruited on a phased basis by the Mental Health Commission.  </p>  <p>  The National Disability Authority is currently finalising its work on the suite of draft codes of practice in relation to non-healthcare matters which are required to be prepared under section 103 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.   </p>  <p>  In June 2018, my Department recruited an external legal expert to assist in the preparation of draft regulations in relation to decision-making assistance agreements, co-decision-making agreements, certain matters relating to decision-making representatives, and enduring powers of attorney.  These regulation-making powers are provided for in sections 10(4), 31, 45(3), 45(4), 46(3) and 79 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. Work on the draft regulations is on-going.</p></reply>

Cavan, aimed at enhancing cooperation between law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, particularly in relation to cross border organised criminality and related issues. I met with the Permanent Secretary of the Northern Ireland Department of Justice, the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI in the margins of this conference, where we discussed matters relating to security in the border region, both now and in the context of Brexit. </p><p>I recently spoke to the Home Secretary and have also met the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I can assure the Deputy that I took these opportunities to reaffirm our deep commitment to continuing the close working relationship that we have with our colleagues in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom and we discussed matters including security and risks in the Border region.  The Deputy will also be aware of An Taoiseach's discussions with Prime Minister Johnson, as detailed in his responses to recent Parliamentary Questions on the matter. </p><p>It is also important to note that the Garda Commissioner recently made an operational decision to establish an additional Armed Support Unit (ASU) in Cavan which became operational this week.  It will complement the work of the Units nationwide, including those in Ballyshannon, Co. Donegal and Dundalk, Co. Louth in the Northern Region. </p><p>The Northern region also continues to benefit from the accelerated recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, supported by the unprecedented level of Government funding to the organisation.Garda strength in the Northern Region has increased to approximately 1,500, an increase of 150 Garda&iacute; since the end of 2017.  These Garda&iacute; are supported by approximately 150 Garda staff in the region, which represents an increase of almost 30% over the past 3 years, which means that additional Garda&iacute; can be redeployed from administrative to operational policing duties where their training and policing expertise can be used to best effect.</p><p>Requirements in the region will in the usual way be kept under ongoing review by Garda management. In the event that a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit gives rise to additional requirements in border areas, I understand from the Commissioner that further resources can and will be provided as needed.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level. It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally. These procedures are continually evolving arising from, for example, service improvements due to the introduction of new technology and updated work practices.</p>  <p>  In general, it takes around 6 months for a standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process.</p>  <p>  Specifically, the average processing time from the date an application was received on to the date a decision was made was 6.7 months in 2016, 7.2 months in 2017 and 6.5 months in 2018. Additional security checks can result in some applications taking longer than this average timescale. Such checks are fundamental to maintaining the legitimacy of the naturalisation process both nationally and internationally.</p>  <p>  In addition, processing timescales can be impacted due to incomplete applications having to be returned, further documentation being required from the applicant, or where payment of the required certificate fee is awaited, or the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service of my Department. Sometimes the input of several government agencies, both within and without this jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Delays can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered. In other instances the applicant themselves may request that their application is put on hold.</p>  <p>  The Immigration Service Improvement Plan 2018-2020 commits the Immigration Service to significant investment in technological developments including the roll-out of online forms and payments for citizenship applications. Such developments are expected to deliver significant improvements to customer experiences and processing timescales. Customer improvement is to the fore, a recent example of which is that applicant's Passports are generally returned to them within 2 working days of receipt. This development has been positively received by applicants.  As of 11 September 2019, a notice was placed on the Immigration Services website indicating that if an applicant does not receive their passport within 10 working days they should contact the Citizenship office helpline: citizenshipinfo@justice.ie This is a major improvement in comparison to the period of approximately 10 weeks which pertained in the early summer months.</p>  <p>  The final stage of a naturalisation process, as it relates to adults, requires the applicant to attend at a citizenship ceremony. Obviously, the applicant does not become an Irish citizen until they attend the ceremony to make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State, give an undertaking to uphold the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values and receive their certificate of naturalisation.</p>  <p>  The Immigration Service of Department devotes considerable resources to the processing of these applications. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants interested in the progress of their application, details of which are available on www.inis.gov.ie.</p></reply>

I hope to be able to take Report Stage in the D&aacute;il as soon as possible in this session so that the Bill can be finalised and enacted.</p>  <p>  During the preparation of the Bill, my Department was made aware of the views of stakeholders. This Bill is an interim reform measure and provides an updated regulatory system for local gaming and lottery activity promoted under a permit or licence in Ireland. This measure will enhance consumer protection and assist the better promotion of lotteries.</p>  <p>  Bingo is deemed, by court decisions, to be a lottery activity. Accordingly, a lottery permit or licence must be obtained in accordance with the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956. Lottery licences are issued by the District Court under the Act, with lottery permits being issued by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  At present there is no legislative provision for a special distinction for commercial bingo operators whether under the current Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 or under the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Bill 2019. It is not my intention to change public policy in this regard. </p>  <p>  The modernisation of this area of law is an important priority for the Government and the current Bill is an interim step pending further and more comprehensive reform of the gambling area in general.</p></reply>

They are central to the continued growth of small and medium business and the success of future start up enterprises and entrepreneurs. </p>  <p>  The LEOs, located in the Local Authorities nationwide provide a &lsquo;first-stop-shop&rsquo; for advice, guidance, financial assistance and other supports for entrepreneurs intending to start or grow a business. </p>  <p>  The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories: Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea); Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up); and Business Development Grants for existing businesses that want to expand. (It should be noted that the LEOs do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses). In addition, there is a Technical Assistance Grant available for eligible micro-exporter applicants who are seeking to explore alternative markets for their product or service.</p>  <p>  Anyone with a viable business proposal can also use the LEO to make an application to MicroFinance Ireland, which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-ups with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks. The LEOs can work with these clients on their applications to Microfinance Ireland (MFI) for small business loans of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;25,000 (unsecured). Loans for commercially viable proposals can be used to help fund start-up costs, working capital or business expansion.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, The Agile Innovation Fund has been developed by Enterprise Ireland to support product, service and process innovation to build competitive advantage. The key benefit of this support is that it allows for a simple application process and delivers a faster response time from application to approval. The new Agile Innovation Fund is also open to eligible Local Enterprise Office clients and it allows companies to access up to 50% in support towards innovation projects with a total cost of up to &euro;300,000.</p>  <p>  Additionally, Enterprise Ireland actively works with High Potential Start-Ups, companies with the potential to develop an innovative product or service for sale in international markets and the potential to create 10 jobs and &euro;1m in sales within 3 to 4 years of starting up. </p>  <p>  The LEOs and Enterprise Ireland are an outstanding resource available to businesses and their variety of clients in such a diversity of sectors is a demonstration of the expertise available through these Agencies. Businesses that work closely with benefit significantly from the supports, mentoring and training they provide. My Department will ensure that the Enterprise Agencies continue to get the resources they need to allow start-up entrepreneurs develop and explore new products and ideas.</p></reply>

My Department's focus is on helping firms to improve their competitiveness and innovation, and to diversify markets.  </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies are working to provide extensive supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for Brexit. The suite of enterprise and finance supports now in place covers the spectrum of potential Brexit impacts and aims to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and the practical preparatory actions to be taken over the coming months. I continue to prioritise the development and support for SMEs and entrepreneurs as part of my ongoing engagement with my colleague the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in the preparation of Budget 2020.  </p>  <p>  These will build on the broad array of existing Brexit supports already in place. Since 2016, my Department and its agencies have been working to prepare Irish businesses for the potential challenges posed by Brexit by helping them to assess their preparedness and helping them to implement practical action plans in areas such as customs, supply chain and sourcing, and financial management. While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying and managing key risk areas and develop practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s suite of Brexit supports includes preparedness vouchers, consultancy and mentoring supports, tariff advisory services, research on new markets and innovation supports through Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTradeIreland. Support and advice is also available from the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, IDA Ireland, Revenue, Skillnet Ireland, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Bord Bia and F&aacute;ilte Ireland. </p>  <p>  The most immediate consequences of a hard Brexit are likely to be currency movements, supply chain constraints, delays, duties and tariffs. In the first instance, there will be a strain on the working capital position of businesses.</p>  <p>  Of the Government&rsquo;s suite of supports, the &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme is designed to address working capital challenges brought about by Brexit. Under the scheme, loans of up to &euro;1.5 million are available at a rate of 4% or less, with loans of up to &euro;500,000 available on an unsecured basis. </p>  <p>  As at 27 September, there have been 816 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 738 have been approved, and 194 progressed to sanction at bank level to a total value of &euro;43.52 million. Of the approved applications, 153 were reapplications as eligibility expires after four months.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the &euro;300m Future Growth Loan Scheme is designed to support strategic long-term investment in SMEs in a post-Brexit environment. As at 27 September, there have been 1,353 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 1,283 have been approved, and 270 progressed to sanction at bank level to a total value of &euro;43.8 million.</p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland (ITI) also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. So far this year, more than 4,500 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.  </p>  <p>  ITI offers Brexit Planning Voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enable businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. </p>  <p>  ITI's Brexit Planning Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. 1,893 businesses have applied for a Brexit Planning Voucher, of which 1,630 have been approved. ITI&rsquo;s Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This allows businesses to implement critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.</p>  <p>  In August, ITI launched a new advertising campaign and a new online resource to encourage and assist firms in preparing for Brexit. The online &ldquo;Bitesize Brexit&rdquo; resource is a one-stop-shop for cross-border traders, presenting information in easily digestible segments and includes specific actions businesses should take in preparing for Brexit.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also recently launched twelve &lsquo;Brexit Essential&rsquo; questions aimed at helping exporting businesses further prepare and take action ahead of the UK&rsquo;s impending withdrawal from the EU.  The Brexit Essentials campaign highlights the key questions and documentation that businesses need to address in order to trade successfully with the UK post 31 October.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government, in association with key industry partners, also launched a new support measure to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses develop the capacity to deal with the additional customs requirements due to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. The new initiative called Clear Customs comprises of a training programme and a customs financial support to assist with the costs of recruiting and assigning new staff to customs roles.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has held over 100 Brexit information seminars and events since last September. I also have been convening regular roundtable discussions with the main retail grocery and distribution players since December to better understand contingency planning within the sector on food supply. Revenue, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, Dublin Port and relevant Government Departments also attend these meetings.</p>  <p>  With the deadline for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU fast approaching, the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit continues to represent a significant challenge for businesses in Ireland. I want businesses, particularly those most impacted by Brexit, to know my Department and its agencies are here to help.</p></reply>

Pending completion of this process it is not appropriate for me to comment further at this stage. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Motorised Transport Grant, this scheme operated as a means-tested grant to assist persons with severe disabilities with the purchase or adaptation of a car, where that car was essential to retain employment. The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013,  no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that in July last, my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development announced CL&Aacute;R funding of &euro;890,632 to 20 voluntary community organisations. This funding will support the purchase and/or fit out of vehicles to provide transport for people in rural areas with mobility issues. It will support voluntary organisations that provide:</p>  <p>  - transport for people with significant mobility issues, including those requiring specialised  wheelchair accessible vehicles, to day-care or other medical, therapeutic or respite services; or</p>  <p>  - transport to/from designated cancer treatment hospitals/centres under the National Cancer Care Programme.</p></reply>

The HSE advises that this is because there is no evidence that screening would be of any benefit to them. At this stage in life, normal cell changes in the cervix can look very like abnormal cells. If CervicalCheck tested women under 25, changes that are normal might be treated as abnormal and a woman could be sent for treatment when they don't need it. Invasive cervical cancer is also very rare at this age. The HSE advises any woman under 25 who is worried about their risk of developing cervical cancer to speak to their GP. </p>  <p>  This approach is in line with screening programmes in other countries. The UK National Screening Committee recommended in November 2012 that the age of first invitation for cervical screening should be raised to 25 in Wales and Scotland on the basis that there is evidence of a large number of women screened and treated with relatively little benefit below this age.</p>  <p>  Cancer screening is one important aspect of cancer prevention, and another is vaccination. The HPV vaccine protects against the HPV virus which can cause cancer and genital warts in both women and men, and has been offered to girls in their first year of secondary school since 2010. The Deputy may wish to know that, following a positive recommendation from HIQA, that an extension of the HPV vaccination programme to boys would be both clinically and cost effective, as of September this year HPV vaccination is now available to boys in first year of secondary school also.</p></reply>

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro, ongoing investments. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed their assessment for Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) indicated for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). They recommended that Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) not be reimbursed for this indication. </p>  <p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded, the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group and the HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the statutory criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

In this regard the Department is examining the feasibility of implementing multi-annual budgeting in the healthcare system, including in Social Care and disability service provision.</p></reply>

My Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  It is intended that this proposed policy change, the 3 year cap, will be extended to eligible existing participants in long term residential care so that they are not disadvantaged, but that there would be no retrospective recoupment of contributions for those who have paid contributions over and above the 3 year period.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the NHSS was approved by Government on the 11th June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. I intend to progress this as quickly as possible, however, the timeline for completion of the legislation will also depend on how it passes through the Houses. The General Scheme has been sent to the relevant Joint Committee and I look forward to participating in pre-legislative scrutiny when a date is agreed with the Committee.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-02a.447.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100200076#WRH02300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 to 207, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The principal statutory function of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) is the protection, management and conservation of the inland fisheries resource. </p>  <p>  Similarly to all bodies and individuals, IFI has an obligation to abide by statutory and EU requirements and consults appropriately with the Planning Authorities when necessary. There is a requirement that sponsors of fisheries development projects, to whom planning exemptions are not available, simply ascertain whether proposals, involving the expending of public funds, might require planning permission. </p>  <p>  Specifically, IFI has obligations under national and EU legislation to ensure that projects that it oversees and licences that it grants, have due regard for the environment and environmental legislation. IFI introduced its Environmental Assessment Process (EAP) on foot of recent environmental legislation relating to the EU Habitats Directive (2011). The primary legislation related to the EAP pertains to Appropriate Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment, guidance on which is provided respectively by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>  <p>  IFI&rsquo;s has set out a guidance document describing the EAP and procedures in place within IFI to facilitate fisheries development and conservation works in inland and coastal waters. This is available publically on IFI&rsquo;s website: www.fisheriesireland.ie.  It also outlines the internal and external review/screening processes for environmental assessment of plans and projects, and details the procedures that are in place to ensure that these works are carried out in compliance with the relevant EU and national legislation. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the vast majority of Ireland&rsquo;s inland fishery waters are included in, hydrologically connected to, or adjacent to Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). Development in, connected to, or within 15 kilometres of, an SAC requires screening for Appropriate Assessment (AA) under the EU Habitats Directive and this necessitates consultation by the project promoter with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the NPWS. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that since the European Court of Justice, ruling in the &ldquo;People over Wind&rdquo; case, in April 2018, screenings for AA can no longer include mitigation. This means that, since 2018, many more AAs have had to proceed to Natura Impact Statement (NIS) stage than was previously the case. When a project includes an NIS, it has to have the consent of the Planning Authority. Consequently, the number of fisheries development projects that require consultation with Planning Authorities has increased since 2018. </p>  <p>  IFI provides grant aid for fisheries related work which may or may not be in OPW drained channels. The funding is available to angling clubs, community groups and Local Authorities and is subject, like all public funding schemes, to all statutory conditions being met and relevant statutory permissions/consents obtained. Grantees wishing to avail of such public funding are requested to provide confirmation of planning status (as opposed to obtaining planning permission), in many cases planning may not be required and a preplanning meeting with the relevant local authority will easily confirm same. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the response to Question No. 499 of 21 May last, the potential exemptions available to IFI, under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (Statutory Instrument 600 of 2001) are very narrowly constrained. There are a very limited number of potential exemptions available directly to IFI and these are tightly restricted to a small range of project types. </p>  <p>  Such projects are usually undertaken by IFI or under IFI supervision in view of its statutory role. It is long standing IFI policy and practice, as a responsible public body, to consult with the relevant Local Authority and other statutory bodies in relation to projects it is undertaking, notwithstanding potential exemptions in domestic law. I would also emphasise that the application of such exemptions is ultimately a matter for the Planning Authority who, consequently, must be consulted.</p>  <p>  IFI and my Department have consistently briefed stakeholders who have raised this issue and, despite this, some persist in the mistaken view that a broad range of exemptions is available under the Planning Regulations referred to and do not consider that EU environmental requirements have moved on in the 18 years since the 2001 Planning Regulations were enacted. </p>  <p>  The environmental demands placed on IFI and others engaged in development work has become increasingly complex and, I therefore offer the Deputy a comprehensive briefing with IFI.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-02a.450.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100200076#WRH02800"><p>Climate considerations have been placed at the heart of Government&rsquo;s policy-making and decision-making processes.  The Climate Action Plan clearly recognises that Ireland must significantly step up its commitments to tackle climate disruption. The transport sector, which accounts for a fifth of Ireland's greenhouse emissions annually and which has a heavy reliance on fossil fuel usage, has an important role to play in this national decarbonisation effort.</p>  <p>  The movement of goods by road is the second biggest source of transport emissions after private car use. According to the most recent emissions inventory, heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) alone contributed over 18% of Ireland's total land transport emissions in 2017. Clearly, emissions from the freight sector are difficult to address &ndash; HDVs account for only around 5% of vehicles on EU roads but they are responsible for some 25% of all EU road transport emissions. Without significant policy action, their emissions trajectory is projected to continue to rise by almost a fifth between 2010 and 2050.  This trajectory may be even steeper in Ireland where there has been a steady annual increase in road freight activity levels and the number of additional new goods vehicles being licensed in recent years.  Accordingly, developing measures to help address emissions from this sector is critical.</p>  <p>  The quickest way to avoid freight emissions is to streamline operations and ensure that vehicle loads and journey routes are optimised.  Freight companies are adept at optimising logistical operations and these practices should be encouraged to continue. In tandem, using the most efficient and lowest emitting vehicles is also essential in limiting freight emissions. For this reason, Ireland was very supportive of the introduction of new EU Regulations that set maximum fleet emission averages for new HDVs. New vehicles must emit 15% and 30% less CO2  by 2025 and 2030 respectively relative to average emissions over the period July 2019 to June 2020.  Similar legislation has proved to be a very effective approach in other jurisdictions (e.g. Japan, the USA and Canada) and has already been demonstrated to deliver marked emission reductions with cars/vans in Europe. </p>  <p>  As well as making the vehicles more efficient, lower emitting fuels must be employed. Although the Euro VI standard for HDVs represents a considerable improvement over older and more polluting Euro standards, for climate and air quality reasons Ireland must begin to move beyond the use of fossil fuels.  A range of new alternative fuel solutions are emerging across the fleet spectrum. The Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce recently concluded its deliberations on the potential role of alternative fuels, including compressed natural gas (CNG) as a pathway to biomethane, biofuels, and hydrogen in the freight sector. The Taskforce has made recommendations to help accelerate the uptake of alternative fuels and technologies, which are being presented to the Government.  This is especially important as new vehicles entering the fleet over the coming years will likely remain in the fleet for most or all of the coming decade.   </p>  <p>  At present there are a number of incentives in place to encourage the uptake of lower emitting alternatives, namely:</p>  <p>  - a low excise rate for natural gas and biogas for a period of eight years;</p>  <p>  - an accelerated capital allowance scheme for gas-propelled vehicles and related equipment; and</p>  <p>  - support for the roll-out of refuelling infrastructure for alternative fuels and technologies.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is supporting a range of research into decarbonising the freight sector.  Two freight projects are also approved for funding under the Climate Action Fund.</p>  <p>  We are focusing our finite resources on supporting the uptake of new lower emitting alternatives.  Furthermore, more energy, fuel and emissions efficient fossil fueled vehicles should have no purchase price premium and lower running costs for operators and, accordingly, should need no incentive from Government to support uptake.  Accordingly, I have no immediate plans to introduce a grant or capital allowance scheme to assist road haulage companies to buy new diesel vehicles.</p></reply>

These Directives set out the legal basis for charging HGVs for the use of road infrastructure and authorise Member States, if they so wish, to levy user charges, which can be time-based, for example per day, week or year, or distance-based, calculated on the number of kilometres driven. Any such charges must apply to all HGVs, both domestic and foreign, using the Member State&rsquo;s road infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The Irish Government raised serious concerns about the introduction in April 2014 of the HGV road user levy in the UK, including Northern Ireland, and lobbied the UK authorities to exempt Northern Ireland from the charge because of the potential impact on cross-Border trade. However, the UK Minister for Transport rejected this proposal and opted to give only very minor exemptions from the levy to Northern Ireland. While it is appreciated that the road user levy has imposed significant additional costs on Irish hauliers operating across the region, its application is a matter for the UK authorities. </p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to introduce a road charging regime in Ireland, over and above the various toll roads in operation.  Any such plans would have to be considered having regard to the impacts on business and the economy, on the environment including climate change, and for the most efficient use of infrastructure as well as the social impacts.</p></reply>

This is something that remains under active consideration. </p>  <p>  A significant proportion of our goods, estimated at &euro;21 billion, destined for or coming from EU markets are transported via the UK landbridge. The landbridge is the fastest route to continental Europe and as such is relied upon for the transport of time-sensitive products, such as those in the agri-food/perishable goods sector, just-in-time and high value goods.  Any delays or barriers will be detrimental for these sectors in particular.  </p>  <p>  Recent reports from the UK indicate the potential for significant reductions in traffic volumes through key ports such as Dover and Holyhead as a result of the additional requirements for customs and other regulatory documentation and procedures. Significant new infrastructure, and associated staffing, is in place in Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort to implement the additional customs, agriculture and environmental health controls that will be required in Dublin and Rosslare when the UK leave the EU. While these are are designed to minimise the level of disruption that may arise from the additional checks, some disruption can be expected.  </p>  <p>  The main alternative to the UK landbridge is the direct shipping routes to continental EU ports. Following a series of meetings between my officials and the major ferry companies operating at Irish ports, I am assured that sufficient capacity exists on direct services and that shipping companies can adapt to changing market demands that may arise.  </p>  <p>  We have seen the evidence of additional capacity and services recently with the increase in shipping capacity on direct routes to continental ports. These services include the MV Celine which was last year launched from Dublin Port and will serve routes to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge and the MV WB Yeats, on the Dublin &ndash; Cherbourg route from March 2019 for the summer season.  Additionally, a new ferry route to Santander in Spain commenced from the Port of Cork in 2018.</p>  <p>  If disruption to the landbridge does arise, it is likely to be most acute in the immediate period following the UK exit. My Department, along with IMDO, is implementing a number of mitigating actions to encourage a market response in a timely manner. This includes a focussed awareness campaign for shipping companies, importers and exporters aimed at creating a dialogue to identify new market demands as early as possible. On the 4th September, my Department in conjunction with the IMDO, hosted a workshop in relation to Maritime connectivity.  A range of stakeholders attended, such as importers, exporters, ferry companies, haulage companies and business sectors. The aim of this workshop was to provide a forum to consider the risk posed by the UK Landbridge and the options for future direct connectivity to continental ports.</p>  <p>  However my Department is continuing to monitor and to assess the potential implications on connectivity to EU markets in the lead up to a potential no-deal Brexit. </p></reply>

Over 12,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to close to &euro;1 billion.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.  <b></b></p><p>The Programme&rsquo;s objectives are to:</p><p>- Assist voluntary and community organisations, national governing bodies (NGBs) of sport, local authorities and Education and Training Boards and schools to develop high quality, accessible, safe, well-designed, sustainable facilities in appropriate locations and to provide appropriate equipment to help maximise participation in sport and physical recreation.</p><p>- Prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas and groups (such as people with disabilities) in the provision of sports facilities.</p><p>- Encourage the sharing of sports facilities by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport</p><p>Details of all allocations under the programme are available on my Department's website at </p><p>The 2018 round of the Sports Capital Programme closed for applications on Friday 19th October last.  By that deadline, a record 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding. 186 of these applications were for projects that were deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme that subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January. </p><p>619 equipment only applications were assessed next and 466 allocations with a value of &euro;9.8m were announced to these organisations in May.</p><p>Work is now underway in assessing the remaining applications for capital works.  For the first time, applicants who submitted incorrect documentation under this round are being given the opportunity to correct their application during the assessment period. While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a further number of weeks to have all applications assessed with allocations announced shortly after that. As soon as allocations have been made, my Department will carry out a review of all aspects of the 2018 round of the programme to include any possible improvements for the future. This review will include consideration of the timing and scale of the next round.</p><p>In relation to larger capital projects, the National Sports Policy which was published last year provided for the establishment of a new Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). The aim of the fund is to provide support for larger sports facilities where the Exchequer investment is greater than the maximum amount available under the Sports Capital Programme (SCP). These may be projects where the primary objective will be to increase active participation in sport or large scale venues/stadia where the focus is more related to social participation and high performance sport. The new fund is designed to provide a transparent and robust system for funding such projects.  </p><p>The Government has provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m for the period to 2027 for the LSSIF. The new scheme closed for applications on the 17th April with applications initially confined to local authorities and National Governing Bodies of sport. By the closing date, 72 applications were received. Details of all applications received have been published on the Department's website along with the evaluation procedures and guidelines.  </p><p>Assessment work is continuing in the Department but in view of the detailed information contained in each application, it will take a number of months to have all of this work complete.  Accordingly, I expect that it will be towards the end of this year before any allocations are announced.</p></reply>

Brexit could impact on the efficiency of the landbridge route particularly where there are increased border and custom procedures and associated delays, or were the UK to subsequently apply differing standards, road charging or regulatory regimes. The landbridge is the fastest route to continental Europe and as such is relied upon for the transport of time-sensitive products, such as some in the fresh agri-food/perishable goods sector, just-in-time and high value goods. Any delays or barriers to this key route to European markets will be detrimental for certain sectors. Significant work has been and continues to be undertaken through the Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in seeking to ensure continued access through the landbridge to markets in continental Europe.</p>  <p>  Eight Meetings have been held with shipping companies and shipping interests by my Department and the IMDO in January and February 2019.  These discussions with shipping companies have been continued by my Department since then, up to recent days, while the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) who report to my Department have been consulting extensively with the Maritime sector, including shipping, port and other maritime interests regarding Brexit issues on an ongoing basis.  A number of consistent views have emerged from the meetings and consultations with the shipping companies.  Shipping companies remain confident that the market will be responsive in meeting any challenge in a no-deal scenario should there be a switch in demand to direct services. </p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit, there has already been a significant market response evidencing the capacity of market participants to respond to shifts in trade patterns resulting from Brexit. This includes:</p>  <p>  -  In 2018, CLdN lauched MV  Celine, the world&rsquo;s largest RoRo vessel, and in 2019 launched the MV Laureline  RoRo vessel, significantly increasing capacity on the Dublin-Rotterdam and Dublin-Zeebrugge routes.</p>  <p>  -  In May 2018, Brittany Ferries  commenced a service from Cork to Santander and Roscoff. </p>  <p>  -  Irish Ferries investment of &euro;150 million in its newest passenger and freight vessel, MV W.B. Yeats, provides year-round freight capacity between Ireland and France of 165 HGVs per sailing or 60,600 HGVs per annum and a vessel of a similar size is due to be delivered on the Irish sea routes in 2020.</p>  <p>  -  In July 2019, BG Freight Line announced the commencement of a direct Waterford-Rotterdam route weekly Lo/Lo freight service, which will act as a deep sea feeder through Rotterdam port and onwards to worldwide destinations for Irish importers and exporters. </p>  <p>  In the light of my Department&rsquo;s continued consultations with shipping companies, I am of the view that shipping services can be expected to adapt to changing market demands that may arise as a consequence of Brexit. We have seen the evidence of this over the last few years with the increase in shipping capacity on direct routes to continental ports that I have mentioned.</p></reply>

The lack of consistency of care together with high staff turnover impact directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill the workforce. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development.</p>  <p>  Over the past 4 budgets the level of public investment in early learning and care and school-age childcare services has increased 117%, and the level of investment needs to continue rising if we are to secure services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.</p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff. </p>  <p>  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the sector. I have repeatedly called for the sector to pursue a Sectoral Employment Order, which offers a viable mechanism to establish appropriate wage levels. My Department will readily co-operate with such a process when it is under way.</p>  <p>  In the interim, I have introduced a range of measures to support employers to improve pay and conditions. These include a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; annual Programme Support Payments to recognise administrative demands; support for school-age childcare, which will make it easier for service providers to offer staff full-time employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD.</p>  <p>  I have set out my vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in First 5, which contains a commitment to develop a Workforce Development Plan which will ensure appropriate levels of early learning and care and school-age childcare staff at all levels in the sector. The Workforce Development Plan will establish role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms. It will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing a career framework and leadership development opportunities, and it will work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.</p></reply>

The intention behind Baby Boxes is to welcome a new arrival to a family, acknowledging this very significant moment for parents. Baby Boxes offer the opportunity to communicate important child development and safety messages and is an early opportunity to link with parents in need of support services.  </p>  <p>  As indicated in the Implementation Plan, an oversight group will be established this year to lead the development of the pilot and scope to project to prepare for implementation and evaluation.   </p>  <p>  While resourcing has been secured through the Dormant Accounts Fund to progress the pilot, there has been no expenditure to date as this pilot has not yet begun.  </p>  <p>   The cost of providing a Baby Box will depend on the items selected for inclusion, as well as the design of the box and any logistical costs - all of which have to be determined.  However, by means of international comparison, in Scotland a very well equipped baby box is costed at &pound;160, exclusive of delivery costs.  The equivalent figure in Finland is &euro;170.  There were just over 61,000 births in Ireland in 2018. </p>  <p>  There are some baby box schemes in operation via maternity hospitals and otherwise in different parts of the country but my Department is not involved in funding or co-ordinating these.</p></reply>

The type of food provided under the Urban School Meals Scheme is decided by individual schools and agreed with the Local Authorities. </p>  <p>  The school meals (local projects) scheme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,580 schools and organisations benefitting 250,000 children. The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them. The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Nutrition Standards for School Meals&rsquo;, which was published in September 2017 under the auspices of Healthy Ireland, is a valuable resource to enable and promote healthy eating and healthy lifestyles in schools. These standards complement and strengthen the healthy eating guidelines that were already in place. The standards were introduced commencing from January 2018 and all schools participating in the school meals scheme are expected to fully comply with these standards from September 2018. </p>  <p>  In terms of assessing whether schools meet the requirements set out in Healthy Ireland guides and the Obesity Policy and Action Plan, schools and organisations must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records at the end of each school year.  Expenditure on unhealthy food items is deducted from the funding allocation. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department initiated an on-site inspection programme in 2012 to ensure that the scheme rules are being adhered to including an assessment of the type of food provided. My Department recently introduced service level agreements with all participating schools and organisations which sets out the responsibilities of participants.</p></reply>

Therefore when an employer has 23 or more WSS employees a 50% top up is applied to the hourly rate increasing the payment rate to &euro;7.95 per hour for each employee.<table><tr><th>3 to 6 employees with a   disability</th><th>10% top-up of wage subsidy paid</th></tr><tr><td>7 to 11 employees with a disability </td><td>20% top-up of wage subsidy paid</td></tr><tr><td>12 to 16 employees with a disability </td><td>30% top-up of wage subsidy paid</td></tr><tr><td>17 to 22 employees with a disability </td><td>40% top-up of wage subsidy paid</td></tr><tr><td>23 + employees with a disability </td><td>50% top-up of wage subsidy paid</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Strand III</b>subsidy enables employers who employ 30 or more workers with a disability on the Wage Subsidy Scheme to be eligible for a grant of up to &euro;30,000 per year towards the expense of employing an Employment Assistance Officer (EAO) to support these employees.</p><p>At end June 2019, there were 1,671 private sector employers availing of the wage subsidy with 2,722 people with disabilities employed.

Phase one entailed four years&rsquo; of client referrals, while phase two entailed a &lsquo;run off&rsquo; period during which time no additional clients were to be referred.  Therefore client referrals were due to cease on 31st December 2019. The contract included an option to extend the term of referrals for a period no greater than two years. </p>  <p>  As per an econometric review carried out by my Department, JobPath has been, and continues to be, a successful service in providing a comprehensive and value for money activation service for the long-term unemployed. On this basis, my Department triggered the extension provisions of the existing contracts with the JobPath providers and secured agreement on the extension of these contracts on existing terms and conditions for a further twelve months.  </p>  <p>  This is not a renewal of the JobPath contracts but the execution of the extension clauses of the existing contracts. </p>  <p>  This extension is important as it will ensure that the Government retains the necessary labour activation capacity to deal with any labour market uncertainty that arises as a result of Brexit. </p>  <p>  With regard to Community Employment (CE) schemes, Jobseekers currently engaged on a CE scheme are not eligible for selection for the JobPath service.  On finishing a CE placement however, long term jobseekers will become eligible for activation services provided by my Department, including referral to JobPath. This ensures that the benefits of the experience and training that they received during their time on CE are maximised.  </p>  <p>  If referred to JobPath they will receive one-to-one, intensive and regular engagement with a personal adviser who will assess their skills, experience, challenges and work goals and assist them in finding full-time sustainable employment.  This process will also help identify potential employment opportunities and offer support to the individual in overcoming any barriers to employment. </p>  <p>From 1st  June 2018 all persons currently engaged with JobPath may also elect to take up a placement on CE whilst continuing to engage with their JobPath provider.  Application for participation on CE by JobPath customers is entirely voluntary and at their discretion. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>
